Prediction of hydrodynamic performance of an FLNG system in side-by-side offloading operation,"Wenhua Zhao, Jianmin Yang, Zhiqiang Hu, Longbin Tao, ","Journal of Fluids and Structures, Volume 46, April 2014, Pages 89-110, ","Floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) is a type of liquefied natural gas (LNG) production system that shows prospects in exploitation of stranded offshore gas fields. The dynamic performance of an FLNG system in side-by-side configuration with a LNG carrier under the combined actions of wave, current and wind can be quite complex. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the hydrodynamics of an FLNG system with a focus on the nonlinear coupling effects of vessels and connection systems based on the concept FLNG prototype recently designed for South China Sea. In this study, the hydrodynamic characteristics of the two floating vessels connected through hawsers and fenders are investigated using a state-of-the-art time-domain simulation code SIMO, considering their mechanical and hydrodynamic coupling effects. The simulation model consisting of FLNG and LNG carrier is developed and calibrated by a series of model tests including a tuned damping and viscous levels. The hydrodynamic performances of the two floating vessels under an extreme sea state during side-by-side offloading operation are obtained, and their relative motions and the force responses of the connection hawsers and fenders are analyzed. Sensitivity studies are conducted to clarify contributions from the pretension and the stiffness of the connection hawsers. The effects on the hydrodynamic performance of the vessels and on the loads of the connection system are also investigated."
An empirical analysis on the relationship between IPO waves and market timing on the basis of product market competition in China,"Zhiqiang Hu, Lina Han, Xiaolin Guo, ","Procedia Environmental Sciences, Volume 11, Part A, 2011, Pages 218-226, ","Since IPO waves was firstly proposed by Ibbotson& Jaffe (l975) and Ritter (1984), many scholars has analyzed it, combining with market timing. However, few of them used models or did empirical analysis on the basis of product market. Till Chemmanur&Jie He (2009) who studied the IPO waves on the product market shows us a new approach to analyze IPO waves. Thus, this paper will build a modified model on product market, which takes the policy factor in China into consideration and gives several propositions. Moreover, based on the manufacturing firms listed in A share market of Shanghai and Shenzhen securities market from July of 1999 to December of 2009, we examined hypotheses and that whether there are IPO waves in china manufacturing or not.

Coupled analysis of nonlinear sloshing and ship motions,"Wenhua Zhao, Jianmin Yang, Zhiqiang Hu, Longbin Tao, ","Applied Ocean Research, Volume 47, August 2014, Pages 85-97, ","A coupled numerical model considering nonlinear sloshing flows and the linear ship motions has been developed based on a boundary element method. Hydrodynamic performances of a tank containing internal fluid under regular wave excitations in sway are investigated by the present time-domain simulation model and comparative model tests. The numerical model features well the hydrodynamic performance of a tank and its internal sloshing flows obtained from the experiments. In particular, the numerical simulations of the strong nonlinear sloshing flows at the natural frequency have been validated. The influence of the excitation wave height and wave frequency on ship motions and internal sloshing has been investigated. The magnitude of the internal sloshing increases nonlinearly as the wave excitation increases. It is observed that the asymmetry of the internal sloshing relative to still water surface becomes more pronounced at higher wave excitation. The internal sloshing-induced wave elevation is found to be amplitude-modulated. The frequency of the amplitude modulation envelope is determined by the difference between the incident wave frequency and the natural frequency of the internal sloshing. Furthermore, the coupling mechanism between ship motions and internal sloshing is discussed."

Shin, ","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute, Volume 29, Issue 1, 2002, Pages 647-653, ","The microstructure, dimensions, and fractal geometry of diesel particulates were investigated through morphological observations. A thermophoretic particle-sampling system was developed to collect diesel particulates directly from the high-temperature exhaust stream of a 75 hp single-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine at various engine operating conditions. The morphology of the collected diesel particulates was analyzed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope and subsequent image processing/data acquisition system. The analysis revealed that spherical prinary particles were agglomerated together to form large aggregate clusters at most engine operating conditions. The particles produced at low loading conditions displayed amorphous structures, possibly containing a significant amount of soluble organic fraction, while the soot sample at high engine load conditions mostly exhibited graphitic structures. Measured primary particle sizes ranged from 34.4 to 28.5 nm at various engine operating conditions. The smaller primary particles observed at high engine load conditions were caused by oxidation at the encountered high temperatures. A number of small and irregularly shaped particles were captured at these conditions, which identified the existence of apparent particle oxidation. Engine-speed-dependent experiments were also performed to investigate the effects of the residence time of soot particles on particle growth. A growth mechanism of diesel particulates was suggested through analyses for fractal geometry of the cluster particles."
Linear elastic and plastic-damage analyses of a concrete cut-off wall constructed in deep overburden,"Xiang Yu, Xianjing Kong, Degao Zou, Yang Zhou, Zhiqiang Hu, ","Computers and Geotechnics, Volume 69, September 2015, Pages 462-473, ","Asphalt concrete core dams (ACCDs) are becoming more widely used worldwide. ACCDs with concrete cut-off walls (for controlling foundation seepage) have been constructed in deep overburden. It is important to assess dam safety by analysing the stress and deformation behaviour of the concrete cut-off wall. In this study, a 3D finite element (FE) procedure was developed to simulate the dam construction and water impounding processes of an ACCD. Rockfill/gravel materials were described using a Duncan每Chang model, and the interface between the concrete cut-off wall and the foundation gravel was modelled using interfacial elements that follow a tangential hyperbolic stress每strain model. The linear elastic and plastic-damage models were employed to model the concrete cut-off wall. The stress-deformation behaviour and the damage distribution of the concrete cut-off wall were numerically simulated and analysed. The results indicate that the plastic-damage model was more reliable than the elastic model in describing the mechanical behaviour of the concrete cut-off wall.

Model test research of a semisubmersible floating wind turbine with an improved deficient thrust force correction approach,"Liang Li, Yan Gao, Zhiqiang Hu, Zhiming Yuan, Haoran Li, ","Renewable Energy, Volume 119, April 2018, Pages 95-105, ","This paper investigates the model test research of a semisubmersible floating wind turbine. An improved method is proposed to correct the deficient thrust force in a Froude-scale experimental condition, which is able to simulate the rotor operational state more realistically by allowing the rotor to rotate freely with the wind. This approach also maintains tip speed ratio to some extent and overcomes previously reported negative effects produced by common correction ways. Reduced platform resonant motions in the presence of wind force are observed. Due to rotor rotation, resonant yaw and roll motions are induced even in heading wind and wave state. Tower vibration is found to be suppressed by the wind force. Multi-frequencies components are observed in the response of tower-top shear force, which is governed by the couplings of hydrodynamic loads, aerodynamic loads and tower vibration. It is also found that the dynamic response of the mooring line is mainly dominated by wave load and aerodynamic effect can be simplified as an extra constant force."
Validation of a temperature-gradient-dependent elastic-plastic material model of ice with finite element simulations,"Chu Shi, Zhiqiang Hu, Jonas Ringsberg, Yu Luo, ","Cold Regions Science and Technology, Volume 133, January 2017, Pages 15-25, ","A temperature-gradient-dependent elastic-plastic material model of ice is proposed for the numerical study of the influence of temperature-gradient on impact force in ship-iceberg collisions. The model is based on the ＆Tsai-Wu＊-type yield surface, and an empirical failure criterion is adopted. A series of yield surfaces with different sizes but the same shape are obtained from the linear interpolation of test results to represent the continuous temperature range in an iceberg. Temperature dependence is defined as the change in ice properties due to the temperature gradient as a function of depth of the iceberg. Based on field test data, three types of iceberg temperature profiles are assumed. The ice model is implemented as a user-defined subroutine in the commercial explicit finite element code LS-DYNA. Collisions between a rigid plate and different geometric iceberg shapes are simulated to analyse the influence of iceberg geometry and ice model temperature. The calculated contact area-pressure curves are compared with design laws to further calibrate the proposed ice model. Both a sharp temperature profile and low temperature range can increase the local contact pressure and global contact force as the penetration increases. The simulation results show that the ice model can capture and be used to demonstrate the influence of temperature-gradient on contact force in ship-iceberg collisions."
An analytical method for predicting the ship side structure response in raked bow collisions,"Bin Sun, Zhiqiang Hu, Ge Wang, ","Marine Structures, Volume 41, April 2015, Pages 288-311, ","As an increasing number of ships continue to sail in heavy traffic lanes, the possibility of collision between ships has become progressively higher. Therefore, it is of great importance to rapidly and accurately analyse the response and consequences of a ship's side structure subjected to large impact loads, such as collisions from supply vessels or merchant vessels. As the raked bow is a common design that has a high possibility of impacting a ship side structure, this study proposes an analytical method based on plastic mechanism equations for the rapid prediction of the response of a ship's side structure subjected to raked bow collisions. The new method includes deformation mechanisms of the side shell plating and the stiffeners attached. The deformation mechanisms of deck plating, longitudinal girders and transverse frames are also analysed. The resistance and energy dissipation of the side structure are obtained from individual components and then integrated to assess the complete crashworthiness of the side structure of the struck ship. The analytical prediction method is verified by numerical simulation. Three typical collision scenarios are defined in the numerical simulation using the code LS_DYNA, and the results obtained by the proposed analytical method and those of the numerical simulation are compared. The results correspond well, suggesting that the proposed analytical method can improve ship crashworthiness during the design phase."

Simulation results show that the combined concept achieves a synergy between the floating wind turbine, the wave energy converter and the tidal turbines. Compared with a single floating wind turbine, the combined concept undertakes reduced surge and pitch motions. The overall power production increases by approximately 22%每45% depending on the environmental conditions. Moreover, the power production of the wind turbine is more stable due to the reduced platform motions and the combined concept is less sensitive to the transient effect induced by an emergency shutdown of the wind turbine."
Utility-directed resource allocation in virtual desktop clouds,"Prasad Calyam, Rohit Patali, Alex Berryman, Albert M. Lai, Rajiv Ramnath, ","Computer Networks, Volume 55, Issue 18, 29 December 2011, Pages 4112-4130, ","User communities are rapidly transitioning their ※traditional desktops§ that have dedicated hardware and software installations into ※virtual desktop clouds§ (VDCs) that are accessible via thin-clients. To allocate and manage VDC resources for Internet-scale desktop delivery, existing works focus mainly on managing server-side resources based on utility functions of CPU and memory loads, and do not consider network health and thin-client user experience. Resource allocations without combined utility-directed information of system loads, network health and thin-client user experience in VDC platforms inevitably results in costly guesswork and over-provisioning of resources. In this paper, we develop an analytical model viz., ※Utility-Directed Resource Allocation Model (U-RAM)§ to solve the combined utility-directed resource allocation problem within VDCs. Our solution involves an iterative algorithm that leverages utility functions of system, network and human components obtained using a novel virtual desktop performance benchmarking toolkit viz., ※VDBench§ that we developed. The combined utility functions are used to direct decision schemes based on Kuhn每Tucker optimality conditions for creating user desktop pools and determining optimal resource allocation size/location. We deploy VDBench in a VDC testbed featuring: (a) popular user applications (Spreadsheet Calculator, Internet Browser, Media Player, Interactive Visualization), and (b) TCP/UDP based thin-client protocols (RDP, RGS, PCoIP) under a variety of user load and network health conditions. Simulation results based on the utility functions obtained from the testbed demonstrate that our solution maximizes VDC scalability i.e., ＆VDs per core density＊, and ＆user connections quantity＊, while delivering satisfactory thin-client user experience."
Deciding branching time properties for asynchronous programs,"Rohit Chadha, Mahesh Viswanathan, ","Theoretical Computer Science, Volume 410, Issue 42, 28 September 2009, Pages 4169-4179, ","Asynchronous programming is a paradigm that supports asynchronous function calls in addition to synchronous function calls. Programs in such a setting can be modeled by automata with counters that keep track of the number of pending asynchronous calls for each function, as well as a call stack for synchronous recursive computation.

The decidability of the control state reachability problem for such systems was recently established. In this paper, we consider the problems of checking other branching time properties for such systems. Specifically we consider the following problems 〞 termination, which asks if there is an infinite (non-terminating) computation exhibited by the system; control state maintainability, which asks if there is a maximal execution of the system, where all the state visited lie in some ※good§ set; whether the system can be simulated by a given finite state system; and whether the system can simulate a given finite state system.

Controlled low-strength material using fly ash and AMD sludge,"M. A Gabr, John J Bowders, ","Journal of Hazardous Materials, Volume 76, Issues 2每3, 15 September 2000, Pages 251-263, ","Controlled low-strength material (CLSM) is a cementitious material with properties similar to stabilized soil. After hardening, CLSM provides adequate strength in bearing capacity and support but can also be easily excavated. To be classified as a CLSM, the material must have a compressive strength between 450 kPa (65 psi) and 8400 kPa (1200 psi). Typical CLSM contains coal-combustion fly ash (FA), cement, water and fine or coarse aggregate. In this paper, physical and strength properties of CLSM formed by combining sludge, a by-product from the treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD), with Class F FA are investigated. The sludge is a lime-based waste product that when combined with FA, exhibits self-hardening characteristics similar to cement. A main focus of this research is to develop a CLSM mix in which by-product material utilization is maximized while satisfying workability and performance requirements. A mixture of 10% AMD sludge, 2.5% Portland cement (PC), 87.5% Class F FA (dry wt.%) with water provided unconfined compressive strength values within the range for classification as CLSM. This mixture satisfies the excavatability and walkability requirements as well as the hardening time and stability criteria."

Risk factor quantification, particularly of modifiable risk factors, can help to identify emerging threats to population health and opportunities for prevention. The GBD 2013 provides a timely opportunity to update the comparative risk assessment with new data for exposure, relative risks, and evidence on the appropriate counterfactual risk distribution.Attributable deaths, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) have been estimated for 79 risks or clusters of risks using the GBD 2010 methods. Risk每outcome pairs meeting explicit evidence criteria were assessed for 188 countries for the period 1990每2013 by age and sex using three inputs: risk exposure, relative risks, and the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL). Risks are organised into a hierarchy with blocks of behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks at the first level of the hierarchy. The next level in the hierarchy includes nine clusters of related risks and two individual risks, with more detail provided at levels 3 and 4 of the hierarchy. Compared with GBD 2010, six new risk factors have been added: handwashing practices, occupational exposure to trichloroethylene, childhood wasting, childhood stunting, unsafe sex, and low glomerular filtration rate. For most risks, data for exposure were synthesised with a Bayesian meta-regression method, DisMod-MR 2.0, or spatial-temporal Gaussian process regression. Relative risks were based on meta-regressions of published cohort and intervention studies. Attributable burden for clusters of risks and all risks combined took into account evidence on the mediation of some risks such as high body-mass index (BMI) through other risks such as high systolic blood pressure and high cholesterol.All risks combined account for 57﹞2% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 55﹞8每58﹞5) of deaths and 41﹞6% (40﹞1每43﹞0) of DALYs. Risks quantified account for 87﹞9% (86﹞5每89﹞3) of cardiovascular disease DALYs, ranging to a low of 0% for neonatal disorders and neglected tropical diseases and malaria. In terms of global DALYs in 2013, six risks or clusters of risks each caused more than 5% of DALYs: dietary risks accounting for 11﹞3 million deaths and 241﹞4 million DALYs, high systolic blood pressure for 10﹞4 million deaths and 208﹞1 million DALYs, child and maternal malnutrition for 1﹞7 million deaths and 176﹞9 million DALYs, tobacco smoke for 6﹞1 million deaths and 143﹞5 million DALYs, air pollution for 5﹞5 million deaths and 141﹞5 million DALYs, and high BMI for 4﹞4 million deaths and 134﹞0 million DALYs. Risk factor patterns vary across regions and countries and with time. In sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risk factors are child and maternal malnutrition, unsafe sex, and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing. In women, in nearly all countries in the Americas, north Africa, and the Middle East, and in many other high-income countries, high BMI is the leading risk factor, with high systolic blood pressure as the leading risk in most of Central and Eastern Europe and south and east Asia. For men, high systolic blood pressure or tobacco use are the leading risks in nearly all high-income countries, in north Africa and the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. For men and women, unsafe sex is the leading risk in a corridor from Kenya to South Africa.Behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks can explain half of global mortality and more than one-third of global DALYs providing many opportunities for prevention. Of the larger risks, the attributable burden of high BMI has increased in the past 23 years. In view of the prominence of behavioural risk factors, behavioural and social science research on interventions for these risks should be strengthened. Many prevention and primary care policy options are available now to act on key risks.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation."

The proposed method was based on the interpretation of compressed data stored in memory cells of a self-powered wireless sensor (SWS) with non-constant injection rates. Different 3D finite element (FE) models of an AC pavement were developed using ABAQUS to generate the sensor output data. A realistic dynamic moving load was applied to the surface of the pavement via DLOAD subroutines developed by FORTRAN. A network of sensing nodes was placed at the top of the AC layer to assess their sensitivity to the progression of bottom-up cracks. Several damage states were defined using Element Weakening Method (EWM). A linear-viscoelastic behavior was considered for the AC layer. In order to detect the damage progression, several damage indicator features were extracted from the data acquisition nodes. The damage detection accuracy was improved through a data fusion model that included the effect of group of sensors. The proposed fusion model was based on the integration of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for defining descriptive features, different feature selection algorithms, and a robust computational intelligence approach for multi-class damage classification. Furthermore, an uncertainty analysis was carried out to verify the reliability of the proposed damage detection approach. The results indicate that the progression of the bottom-up cracks can be accurately detected using the developed intelligent self-powered surface sensing system."

It is found that the phase lag times for heat flux and temperature gradient are the identical for the case that the tissue and blood have the same properties. However, the phase lag times are different for the case that the properties of tissue and bloods are different. The phase lag times for brain and muscles are also discussed."
Rapid Intravascular Injection into Limb Skeletal Muscle: A Damage Assessment Study,"Hechmi Toumi, Julia Hegge, Vladimir Subbotin, Mark Noble, James E. Hagstrom, ","Molecular Therapy, Volume 13, Issue 1, January 2006, Pages 229-236, ","We have recently developed a simple and highly efficient methodology for delivering plasmid DNA (pDNA) to skeletal muscle cells of mammalian limbs. The procedure involves the rapid intravascular injection of a large volume of saline (containing pDNA) into the vasculature of the distal limb. As a result of the robust delivery methodology involved, it is important to understand the effects of the injection procedure on the skeletal muscle tissue in the targeted limb. In previous studies, only modest and transient muscle damage was noted. In this study we quantitatively assessed the degree of muscle damage in rat limbs following intravascular injections using muscle histology (H&E staining), membrane integrity (Evans blue staining), and leukocyte infiltration (immunohistochemistry) assays. The rapid extravasation of fluid during the injection process resulted in edema of the muscle tissue of the targeted limb; however, the edema was transient and resolved within 24 h. Consistent with observations from previous studies, minimal levels of myofiber damage were detected. Immunohistochemical labeling indicated that increased numbers of neutrophils (CD43+) and macrophages (ED1+ and ED2+) were present in the muscle tissue interstitium shortly after injection but that elevations were relatively modest and resolved by 2 weeks postinjection."
Stereochemical evidence for a cis-enediol intermediate in Mn-dependent aldose isomerases,"Irwin A. Rose, Edward L. O'Connell, Robert P. Mortlock, ","Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Enzymology, Volume 178, Issue 2, 22 April 1969, Pages 376-379, ","Three Mn2+-dependent bacterial aldose-ketose isomerases were examined to determine the stereochemistry of the C-1 proton of the ketose that is abstracted in the formation of the aldehyde. In the cases of d-xylose isomerase (d-xylose ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.5) and l-arabinose isomerase (l-arabinose ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.4) it is the pro-R position of the d-xylulose and l-ribulose that is activated, whereas in the l-fucose isomerase reaction it is the pro-S position of l-fuculose that is labeled in tritiated water. Little proton exchange occurs in these reactions, especially the xylose isomerase, where retention of the substrate proton is complete.These stereochemical results conform to those of four other sugar isomerases: triose-P, d-ribose-5-P, d-mannose-6-P, and d-glucose-6-P isomerase. Protonation at C-1 or C-2 from the same side of the plane of a cis-enediol gives the correct stereochemical result for all seven isomerase."
Nox5 stability and superoxide production is regulated by C-terminal binding of Hsp90 and CO-chaperones,"Feng Chen, Steven Haigh, Yanfang Yu, Tyler Benson, David J. R. Fulton, ","Free Radical Biology and Medicine, Volume 89, December 2015, Pages 793-805, ","Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that orchestrates the folding and stability of proteins that regulate cellular signaling, proliferation and inflammation. We have previously shown that Hsp90 controls the production of reactive oxygen species by modulating the activity of Noxes1每3 and 5, but not Nox4. The goal of the current study was to define the regions on Nox5 that bind Hsp90 and determine how Hsp90 regulates enzyme activity. In isolated enzyme activity assays, we found that Hsp90 inhibitors selectively decrease superoxide, but not hydrogen peroxide, production. The addition of Hsp90 alone only modestly increases Nox5 enzyme activity but in combination with the co-chaperones, Hsp70, HOP, Hsp40, and p23 it robustly stimulated superoxide, but not hydrogen peroxide, production. Proximity ligation assays reveal that Nox5 and Hsp90 interact in intact cells. In cell lysates using a co-IP approach, Hsp90 binds to Nox5 but not Nox4, and the degree of binding can be influenced by calcium-dependent stimuli. Inhibition of Hsp90 induced the degradation of full length, catalytically inactive and a C-terminal fragment (aa398每719) of Nox5. In contrast, inhibition of Hsp90 did not affect the expression levels of N-terminal fragments (aa1每550) suggesting that Hsp90 binding maintains the stability of C-terminal regions. In Co-IP assays, Hsp90 was bound only to the C-terminal region of Nox5. Further refinement using deletion analysis revealed that the region between aa490-550 mediates Hsp90 binding. Converse mapping experiments show that the C-terminal region of Nox5 bound to the M domain of Hsp90 (aa310每529). In addition to Hsp90, Nox5 bound other components of the foldosome including co-chaperones Hsp70, HOP, p23 and Hsp40. Silencing of HOP, Hsp40 and p23 reduced Nox5-dependent superoxide. In contrast, increased expression of Hsp70 decreased Nox5 activity whereas a mutant of Hsp70 failed to do so. Inhibition of Hsp90 results in the loss of higher molecular weight complexes of Nox5 and decreased interaction between monomers. Collectively these results show that the C-terminal region of Nox5 binds to the M domain of Hsp90 and that the binding of Hsp90 and select co-chaperones facilitate oligomerization and the efficient production of superoxide.Download high-res image (147KB)Download full-size image"
Study on convective heat transfer from pig models by CFD in a virtual wind tunnel,"Hao Li, Li Rong, Guoqiang Zhang, ","Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, Volume 123, April 2016, Pages 203-210, ","Heat stress strongly affects the pig production in hot climate regions, including the summer of many continental climate regions. Although it is recognized that increasing the local air speed in the animal occupied zone is one of the effective approaches to decrease the heat stress of pigs, few studies have been found to quantify the relationship of air speed and convective heat transfer from the pigs. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of airflow speed, turbulence intensity, and animal orientation on the convective heat transfer so that it can be implemented into ventilation control algorithms to provide a better production environment. The study was mainly performed by CFD simulations in two geometry models, a pig model with actual size and a simplified cylinder model, in virtual wind tunnel. The validation of CFD modelling was conducted by comparing the simulated Nusselt number with the values determined by semi-experimental equation for cylinder geometry model. The effects of air speed, inlet turbulence intensity, air incidence angles and pig skin modelling on convective heat transfer coefficients were studied. It is proved that CFD method could be a very good alternative way for this kind of study. The convection heat transfer of a pig model has similar tendency with the cylindrical model following the increasing of air speed. A correlation of convective heat transfer coefficient was found between the geometry of actual pig model and cylinder model. The orientation and turbulence intensity significantly affect the convective heat transfer coefficient of pig, and the results indicate animal orientation and turbulence intensity need to be considered for model development process of the convective heat transfer of pig."
"Biodiversity and evolution of Imjin virus and Thottapalayam virus in Crocidurinae shrews in Zhejiang Province, China","Xian-Dan Lin, Run-Hong Zhou, Fei-Neng Fan, Xu-Hua Ying, Yong-Zhen Zhang, ","Virus Research, Volume 189, 30 August 2014, Pages 114-120, ","The recent discovery of numerous hantaviruses in insectivores has provided a new view of hantavirus biodiversity and evolution. To determine the presence and genetic diversity of Imjin virus (MJNV) and Thottapalayam virus (TPMV) in insectivores in Zhejiang Province, China, we captured and performed virus screening of 32 Ussuri white-toothed shrews (Crocidura lasiura) and 105 Asian house shrews (Suncus murinus) in different coastal regions. Hantavirus genome (S, M, and L segments) sequences were successfully recovered from one Ussuri white-toothed shrew and seven Asian house shrews. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus carried by the Ussuri white-toothed shrew was most closely related to MJNV, but with >15% nucleotide sequence difference, suggesting that it represents a new subtype. The hantaviruses carried by Asian house shrews were closely related to the TPMV variants found in the same geographic area, but more distantly related to those sampled in India and Nepal. Additionally, the TPMV sequences obtained in this study, as well as those found previously in this area, could be divided into three lineages reflecting their geographic origins, indicative of largely allopatric evolution. Overall, our data highlights the high genetic diversity of insectivore-borne hantaviruses in China, suggesting that more may be discovered in the future."

The elastic properties are assumed to vary arbitrarily through the thickness. By dividing the cylinder into some homogeneous sub-cylinders, the analytical solutions for the stresses and displacements are derived explicitly. Some numerical results, based on the presented analytical solutions, are provided to investigate the effects of material non-homogeneity on the distribution of the stresses under the non-uniform internal load. The results show that the behavior of the functionally graded cylinder under the nonaxisymmetric load has some special characteristics other than that of the uniformly pressurized one."
Quality delegation grid: A decision tool for evaluating delegation of management tasks in hospital dietetics departments,"Esther F Myers, Mary B Gregoire, Marian C Spears, ","Journal of the American Dietetic Association, Volume 94, Issue 4, April 1994, Pages 420-424, ","This research was designed to determine perceptions of the quality of task performance; identity personnel currently performing selected management and food production tasks in a hospital dietetics department; and develop a grid for examining delegation strategies. Information on task quality and delegation was obtained from 309 dietitians and 208 support personnel in 151 hospitals. This information was used to develop a quality delegation grid. The grid is divided into four quadrants: High Quality/High Delegation; High Quality/ Low Delegation; Low Quality/High Delegation; and Low Quality/Low Delegation. The grid was used to evaluate the delegation of management tasks reported by participants in this study. Our results indicated that the majority of tasks were placed in the High Quality/High Delegation quadrant (28 tasks) and the Low Quality/Low Delegation quadrant (17 tasks), suggesting that delegation was appropriate for the quality expected if the task was delegated. Three tasks were placed in the Low Quality/High Delegation quadrant indicating that tasks were delegated even though quality of the completed task was perceived as low when delegated, suggesting that dietitians should have performed these tasks themselves. Four tasks were placed in the High Quality/Low Delegation quadrant indicating that dietitians were performing tasks that were perceived to have high quality when performed by support personnel, yet these tasks were rarely delegated. Food service directors could use the grid to identify training needs, differentiate perceptions between dietitians and support personnel, and evaluate current delegation patterns."
Two new methods for deriving the priority vector from interval multiplicative preference relations,"Fanyong Meng, Xiaohong Chen, Mingxun Zhu, Jian Lin, ","Information Fusion, Volume 26, November 2015, Pages 122-135, ","Interval preference relations are widely used in the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for their ability to express the expert＊s uncertainty. The most crucial issue arises when deriving the interval priority vector from the interval preference relations. Based on two of the most commonly used prioritization methods (the eigenvalue method (EM) and the row geometric mean method (RGMM)), two new methods for obtaining the interval priority vector from interval multiplicative preference relations are developed, which endow the expert with different risk preferences for his/her interval judgments. In contrast to existing methods, new approaches calculate the interval priority weights of alternatives separately. Then, several concepts of acceptable consistency for interval multiplicative preference relations are defined. Using a convex combination method, the acceptable consistency of interval multiplicative preference relations can be derived from the associated and exact numerical relations. To increase the distinction of intervals, an improved interval ranking method is presented. After that, two algorithms that can cope with acceptably and unacceptably consistent cases are introduced. Meanwhile, three numerical examples are examined to show the application of the new approaches, and comparisons with several other methods are also made."
"A scoping inquiry into the potential contribution of Subjective Probability Theory, Dempster每Shafer Theory and Possibility Theory in accommodating degrees of belief in traveller behaviour research","David A. Hensher, Zheng Li, ","Travel Behaviour and Society, Volume 1, Issue 2, May 2014, Pages 45-56, ","There is a small but growing interest in traveller behaviour research on investigating ways to identify and quantify degrees of belief (as subjective probabilities or other propositions) associated with behavioural responses, especially in the context of popular travel choice methods such as stated choice experiments, as a way of adding to our understanding of decision making in real-world contexts that are associated with inevitable risk and uncertainty. This paper reviews three major theories that are not well known in the transportation literature that have been developed in psychology and decision sciences to accommodate belief, namely Subjective Probability Theory, Dempster每Shafer Theory and Possibility Theory. We focus on how degrees of belief are measured in these theories. The key elements of each theoretical approach are compared, including their mathematical properties and evidence patterns. Despite their being few applications to date in transportation, the review promotes the relevance of accounting for degrees of belief in travel choice analysis."
The Role of Dopamine in Value-Based Attentional Orienting,"Brian A. Anderson, Hiroto Kuwabara, Dean F. Wong, Emily G. Gean, Steven Yantis, ","Current Biology, Volume 26, Issue 4, 22 February 2016, Pages 550-555, ","Reward learning gives rise to strong attentional biases. Stimuli previously associated with reward automatically capture visual attention regardless of intention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Dopamine signaling within the ventral striatum plays an important role in reward learning, representing the expected reward initiated by a cue [13, 14]. How dopamine and the striatum may be involved in maintaining behaviors that have been shaped by reward learning, even after reward expectancies have changed, is less well understood [15]. Nonspecific measures of brain activity have implicated the striatum in value-based attention [11, 12, 16, 17, 18]. However, the neurochemical mechanisms underlying the attentional priority of learned reward cues remain unexplored. Here, we investigated the contribution of dopamine to value-based attention using positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]raclopride. We show that, in the explicit absence of reward, the magnitude of attentional capture by previously reward-associated but currently task-irrelevant distractors is correlated across individuals with changes in available D2/D3 dopamine receptors (presumably due to intrasynaptic dopamine) linked to distractor processing within the right caudate and posterior putamen. Our findings provide direct evidence linking dopamine signaling within the striatum to the involuntary orienting of attention, and specifically to the attention-grabbing quality of learned reward cues. These findings also shed light on the neurochemical basis of individual susceptibility to value-driven attentional capture, which is known to play a role in addiction [19, 20, 21]. More broadly, the present study highlights the value and feasibility of using PET to relate changes in the release of a neurotransmitter to learning-dependent changes in healthy adults."

The photocatalytic H2O2 production ability of as-prepared catalyst was investigated. The results show that, compared with traditional roasting method, H2 plasma treatment can embed more N vacancies into g-C3N4 lattice. Nitrogen vacancies are the active centers, which can adsorb reactant oxygen molecules as well as trap photoelectrons and promote the transfer of photoelectrons from the catalyst to adsorbed oxygen molecules for the subsequent reduction reaction.

Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis among muscles of different color stability using tandem mass tag labeling,"Zheng Li, Meng Li, Xin Li, Jianzeng Xin, Dequan Zhang, ","Food Chemistry, Volume 249, 30 May 2018, Pages 8-15, ","A quantitative analysis of protein phosphorylation in ovine LTL muscle with different color stability was performed in the present study using TMT labeling in combination with TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment. A total of 3412 phosphopeptides assigned to 1070 phosphoproteins were identified by mass spectrometry, of which 243 proteins were detected to be differentially phosphorylated between muscles of different color stability. Among these differentially phosphorylated proteins, 27 phosphoproteins were identified to be key color-related proteins by informatics analysis. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, especially glycolytic enzymes, were the largest cluster of protein determined to be color-related. In addition, the phosphorylation of myoglobin at Ser133 plays a negative role in the regulation of meat color stability. In summary, this study revealed that the phosphorylation of some glycolytic enzymes and myoglobin at specific serine residues may play critical roles in the regulation of meat color stability."
Complete oxidation of formaldehyde over TiO2 supported subnanometer Rh catalyst at ambient temperature,"Xiucheng Sun, Jian Lin, Hongling Guan, Lin Li, Xiaodong Wang, ","Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, Volume 226, 15 June 2018, Pages 575-584, ","Catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde (HCHO) to CO2 and H2O under ambient condition is highly desired for purifying indoor air quality. In this work, it was found for the first time that TiO2 supported subnanometer Rh catalyst exhibited a remarkable activity with complete removal of HCHO at room temperature. The humidity under ambient condition can significantly improve the activity, stability and specific rates but result in lower activation energy for the oxidation of HCHO on this catalyst. A combination of characterizations, such as H2 temperature programmed reduction, adsorption microcalorimetry and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, demonstrated the importance of Rh species for the dissociative adsorption of O2 and the key role of water on the oxidation of HCHO. The O atoms facilitated the transformation of HCHO adsorbed on TiO2 into intermediate of formates, while the presence of water led to the production of hydroxyl probably from the reaction with the adsorbed O species, which promoted the decomposition of formates to CO2. This study can provide an important implication into the design and fabrication of more economic Rh-based catalysts for ambient HCHO oxidation.Download high-res image (288KB)Download full-size image"

The first three principal components of a series of size, antennal and eye measurements and two fitness components (amplexus and number of eggs) were investigated. Smoothing splines using generalized cross-validation scores were found as were least-squares quadratic regression equations. Confidence intervals on shape, as determined by a smoothing parameter, were calculated using a bootstrap approach. Out of 18 cases, there were six cases of no selection, six cases of directional (monotonic) selection, one case of stabilizing selection, one case of disruptive selection, and four cases of selection with multiple internal maxima and minima. Selection on the cave population was frequently directional (5), resulting from strong directional selection for increased size, larger antennae, and smaller eyes. Selection on the spring population, the ancestral habitat for the species, was frequently non-monotonic (five cases) and rarely directional (one case). In both populations, stabilizing selection was rare and no more common than disruptive selection."
Relation of the Prognostic Value of Ventilatory Efficiency to Body Mass Index in Patients With Heart Failure,"Paul Chase, Ross Arena, Jonathan Myers, Joshua Abella, Daniel Bensimhon, ","The American Journal of Cardiology, Volume 101, Issue 3, 1 February 2008, Pages 348-352, ","The ventilatory efficiency, minute ventilation (VE)/carbon dioxide production (VCO2), slope consistently provides valuable prognostic information in patients with heart failure (HF). Patients with a higher body mass index (BMI) have demonstrated an improved prognosis in the HF population, a phenomenon that has been termed the ※obesity paradox.§ The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic ability of the VE/VCO2 slope according to BMI in patients with HF. Seven-hundred four patients with HF (555 men, 149 women, mean age 56.8 ㊣ 13.4 years, ejection fraction 33.1 ㊣ 13.3%) with a BMI ≡18.5 kg/m2 underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Subjects were divided into 3 BMI subgroups (18.5 to 24.9, 25.0 to 29.9, and ≡30 kg/m2). Each subject was tracked for major cardiac events (death, transplantation, left ventricular assist device implantation) for 2 years after testing. There were 86 major cardiac events (71 deaths, 10 transplantations, 5 left ventricular assist device implantations) during the 2-year tracking period (overall annual event rate 8.2%). The VE/VCO2 slope was the strongest prognostic marker in each BMI subgroup. Subjects in the highest BMI group had the lowest mean VE/VCO2 slope and the lowest rate of major cardiac events of the 3 groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that peak VO2 did not add additional prognostic value to the VE/VCO2 slope and was removed from the regression for each BMI subgroup. In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicate that VE/VCO2 slope maintains prognostic value irrespective of BMI in patients with HF."

Nicotine, catecholamine and carbon monoxide concentrations all increased significantly. Smoking increased heart rate and improved atrioventricular conduction in the 13 patients receiving chronic 汕-blocker therapy (mostly for angina pectoris); increases in heart rate and improvement in atrioventricular conduction were not different statistically from those seen in patients not receiving 汕-blocker therapy, suggesting the possibility of a direct effect of nicotine or other components of tobacco smoke.

Persistent sympathomimetic actions of cigarette smoking may explain in part the failure of 汕-blocking drugs to reduce cardiac mortality risk in smokers after myocardial infarction."

The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative pulmonary function and analgesic requirements in patients undergoing either laparoscopic or open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP).STUDY DESIGN:Seventy patients with a body mass index of 40 to 60 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic (n = 36) or open (n = 34) GBP. The two groups were similar in age, gender, body mass index, pulmonary history, and baseline pulmonary function. Pulmonary function studies were performed preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 7. Oxygen saturation and chest radiographs were performed on both groups preoperatively and on postoperative day 1. Postoperative pain was evaluated using a visual analog scale and the amount of narcotic consumed was recorded. Data are presented as mean ㊣ standard deviation.RESULTS:Laparoscopic GBP patients had significantly less impairment of pulmonary function than open GBP patients on the first three postoperative days (p < 0.05). By the 7th postoperative day, all pulmonary function parameters in the laparoscopic GBP group had returned to within preoperative levels, but only one parameter (peak expiratory flow) had returned to preoperative levels in the open GBP group. On the first postoperative day, laparoscopic GBP patients used less morphine than open GBP patients (46 ㊣ 31 mg versus 76 ㊣ 39 mg, respectively, p < 0.001), and visual analog scale pain scores at rest and during mobilization were lower after laparoscopic GBP than after open GBP (p < 0.05). Fewer patients after laparoscopic GBP than after open GBP developed hypoxemia (31% versus 76%, p < 0.001) and segmental atelectasis (6% versus 55%, p = 0.003).CONCLUSION:Laparoscopic gastric bypass resulted in less postoperative suppression of pulmonary function, decreased pain, improved oxygenation, and less atelectasis than open gastric bypass."

The seepage danger without timely detection and rapid response may likely lead to severe accidents such as seepage failure, slope instability, and even levee break. More than 90 percent of levee break events are caused by the seepage. It is very important for seepage behavior identification to determine accurately saturation line in levee engineering. Furthermore, the location of saturation line has a major impact on slope stability in levee engineering. Considering the structure characteristics and service condition of levee engineering, the distributed optical fiber sensing technology is introduced to implement the real-time observation of saturation line in levee engineering. The distributed optical fiber temperature sensor system (DTS)-based monitoring principle of saturation line in levee engineering is investigated. An experimental platform, which consists of DTS, heating system, water-supply system, auxiliary analysis system and levee model, is designed and constructed. The monitoring experiment of saturation line in levee model is implemented on this platform. According to the experimental results, the numerical relationship between moisture content and thermal conductivity in porous medium is identified. A line heat source-based distributed optical fiber method obtaining the thermal conductivity in porous medium is developed. A DTS-based approach is proposed to monitor the saturation line in levee engineering. The embedment pattern of optical fiber for monitoring saturation line is presented."

Electric double layer electrostatics of pH-responsive spherical polyelectrolyte brushes in the decoupled regime,"Hao Li, Guang Chen, Siddhartha Das, ","Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces, Volume 147, 1 November 2016, Pages 180-190, ","Understanding the behavior and properties of spherical polyelectrolyte brushes (SPEBs), which are polyelectrolyte brushes grafted to a spherical core, is fundamental to many applications in biomedical, chemical and petroleum engineering as well as in pharmaceutics. In this paper, we study the pH-responsive electrostatics of such SPEBs in the decoupled regime. In the first part of the paper, we derive the scaling conditions in terms of the grafting density of the PEs on the spherical core that ensure that the analysis can be performed in the decoupled regime. In such a regime the elastic and the excluded volume effects of polyelectrolyte brushes (PEBs) can be decoupled from the electrostatic effects associated with the PE charge and the induced EDL. As a consequence the PE brush height, assumed to be dictated by the balance of the elastic and excluded volume effects, can be independent of the electrostatic effects. In the second part, we quantify the pH-responsive electrostatics of the SPEBs 每 we pinpoint that the radial monomer distribution for a given brush molecule exhibit a non-unique cubic distribution that decays away from the spherical core. Such a monomer distribution ensures that the hydrogen ion concentration is appropriately accounted for in the description of the SPEB thermodynamics. We anticipate that the present analysis, which provides possibly one of the first models for probing the electrostatics of pH-responsive SPEBs in a thermodynamically-consistent framework, will be vital for understanding the behavior of a large number of entities ranging from PE-coated NPs and stealth liposomes to biomolecules like bacteria and viruses.Download high-res image (151KB)Download full-size image"

IOP was measured 3 times during the day (08:00, 10:00, 16:00 hours) at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, and 12. It was hypothesized that PF tafluprost would be noninferior to PF timolol over 12 weeks with regard to change from baseline IOP. The trial was powered for a noninferiority margin of 1.5 mm Hg at each of the 9 time points assessed.A total of 643 patients were randomized and 618 completed (PF tafluprost = 306, PF timolol = 312). IOPs at the 3 time points assessed during the baseline visit ranged from 23.8 to 26.1 mm Hg in the PF tafluprost group and 23.5 to 26.0 mm Hg in the PF timolol group. IOPs at the 3 time points assessed during the 12-week visit ranged from 17.4 to 18.6 mm Hg for PF tafluprost and 17.9 to 18.5 mm Hg for PF timolol. At all 9 time points, the upper limits of the 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for the difference between treatments in IOP lowering were less than the prespecified noninferiority margin. Similar percentages of PF tafluprost and PF timolol patients reported ocular pain/stinging/irritation (4.4% vs 4.6%) and pruritus (2.5% vs 1.5%). The percentages of PF tafluprost and PF timolol patients reporting conjunctival hyperemia were 4.4% vs 1.2% (nominal P = .016).The IOP-lowering effect of PF tafluprost was noninferior to that of PF timolol. PF tafluprost is an efficacious and generally well-tolerated ocular hypotensive agent."

In this study, we analyzed patients who received ≡1 DES to determine the frequency of noncardiac surgery and cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis in the following week.Among 4,637 DES recipients, 206 (4.4%) underwent major noncardiac surgery in the following year (median days to surgery: 179 [interquartile range 112 to 266 days; range 13 to 360 days]). Overall, stent use averaged 1.5 per patient. The most frequent operations were orthopedic (36%), abdominal (31%), and vascular (20%). Compared with patients who did not undergo surgery, those who did were older, more likely to be women, and have had a prior stroke; the frequencies of prior myocardial infarction, prior coronary artery bypass graft, and diabetes were similar, as were left ventricular ejection fraction and indication for percutaneous coronary intervention. In the 7 days after surgery, 4 patients had a cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis (1.9% [exact 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5% to 4.9%]). The risk of the composite outcome was increased 27-fold in the week following noncardiac surgery compared with any other week after stent implantation (hazard ratio [HR]: 27.3 [95% CI: 10.0 to 74.2], p < 0.001).The frequency of major noncardiac surgery in the year after DES placement is >4%. Although the overall risk of adverse outcomes was less than previously reported when surgery is performed months after DES placement, it is significantly increased in the week after major noncardiac surgery."

Extensive diversity and evolution of hepadnaviruses in bats in China,"Fang-Yuan Nie, Xian-Dan Lin, Zong-Yu Hao, Xiao-Nan Chen, Yong-Zhen Zhang, ","Virology, Volume 514, 15 January 2018, Pages 88-97, ","To better understand the evolution of hepadnaviruses, we sampled bats from Guizhou, Henan and Zhejiang provinces, China, and rodents from Zhejiang province. Genetically diverse hepadnaviruses were identified in a broad range of bat species, with an overall prevalence of 13.3%. In contrast, no rodent hepadnaviruses were identified. The newly discovered bat hepadnaviruses fell into two distinct phylogenetic groups. The viruses within the first group exhibited high diversity, with some closely related to viruses previously identified in Yunnan province. Strikingly, the newly discovered viruses sampled from Jiyuan city in the second phylogenetic group were most closely related to those found in bats from West Africa, suggestive of a long-term association between bats and hepadnaviruses. A co-phylogenetic analysis revealed frequent cross-species transmission among bats from different species, genera, and families. Overall, these data suggest that there are likely few barriers to the cross-species transmission of bat hepadnaviruses."

A simultaneous ERP/fMRI investigation of the P300 aging effect,"Redmond G. O'Connell, Joshua H. Balsters, Sophia M. Kilcullen, William Campbell, Ian H. Robertson, ","Neurobiology of Aging, Volume 33, Issue 10, October 2012, Pages 2448-2461, ","One of the most reliable psychophysiological markers of aging is a linear decrease in the amplitude of the P300 potential, accompanied by a more frontal topographical orientation, but the precise neural origins of these differences have yet to be explored. We acquired simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG)/functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings from 14 older and 15 younger adults who performed a 3-stimulus visual oddball task designed to elicit P3a and P3b components. As in previous reports, older adults had significantly reduced P3a/P3b amplitudes over parietal electrodes but larger amplitudes over frontal scalp with no between-group differences in accuracy or reaction time. Electroencephalogram/functional magnetic resonance imaging fusion revealed that the P3a age effects were driven by increased activation of left inferior frontal and cingulate cortex and decreased activation of inferior parietal cortex in the older group. P3b differences were driven by increased activation of left temporal regions, right hippocampus, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the older group. Our results support the proposal that the age-related P300 anterior shift arises from an increased reliance on prefrontal structures to support target and distractor processing."

The primary end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and urgent revascularization at discharge and death, MI, or target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 1 year. The composite end point at each time point was compared across waves. Multivariable logistic regression was used for in-hospital outcomes and multivariable Cox regression was used for 1-year end points.Ninety-two percent of EVENT patients received at least one DES. One third of patients were treated for Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) (33.8%), and later waves included lower lesion complexity. Across waves there was more frequent clopidogrel loading, a decrease in heparin and an increase in bivalirudin use (all P < .01). The primary composite end point of in-hospital death, MI or urgent revascularization occurred in 7.2% of patients, and did not differ across waves. Despite remarkably high levels of routine DES usage, the composite end point of death, MI, or TLR at 1 year averaged 13.5% and did not differ across waves. After adjustment, no statistically significant effect of wave on composite bleeding (P = .068) as well as in-hospital TLR (P = .053) was noted. At 1 year, wave was associated with a lower likelihood of TLR in the adjusted model (HR 0.81, P = .03).The high-adoption DES era was associated with favorable outcomes, decreasing bleeding rates and changes in antithrombotic approach."
Toxicogenomic analysis identifies the apoptotic pathway as the main cause of hepatotoxicity induced by tributyltin,"Mi Zhou, Mei Feng, Ling-ling Fu, Lin-dan Ji, Jin Xu, ","Food and Chemical Toxicology, Volume 97, November 2016, Pages 316-326, ","Tributyltin (TBT) is one of the most widely used organotin biocides, which has severe endocrine-disrupting effects on marine species and mammals. Given that TBT accumulates at higher levels in the liver than in any other organ, and it acts mainly as a hepatotoxic agent, it is important to clearly delineate the hepatotoxicity of TBT. However, most of the available studies on TBT have focused on observations at the cellular level, while studies at the level of genes and proteins are limited; therefore, the molecular mechanisms of TBT-induced hepatotoxicity remains largely unclear. In the present study, we applied a toxicogenomic approach to investigate the effects of TBT on gene expression in the human normal liver cell line HL7702. Gene expression profiling identified the apoptotic pathway as the major cause of hepatotoxicity induced by TBT. Flow cytometry assays confirmed that medium- and high-dose TBT treatments significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells, and more cells underwent late apoptosis in the high-dose TBT group. The genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs), kinases and tumor necrosis factor receptors mediated TBT-induced apoptosis. These findings revealed novel molecular mechanisms of TBT-induced hepatotoxicity, and the current microarray data may also provide clues for future studies."

By investigating the reactivity of endogenous acyl-CoA metabolites, we found a class of acyl-CoAs that undergo intramolecular catalysis to form reactive intermediates that non-enzymatically modify proteins. Based on this mechanism, we predicted, validated, and characterized a protein modification: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl(HMG)-lysine. In a model of altered HMG-CoA metabolism, we found evidence of two additional protein modifications: 3-methylglutaconyl(MGc)-lysine and 3-methylglutaryl(MG)-lysine. Using quantitative proteomics, we compared the ※acylomes§ of two reactive acyl-CoA species, namely HMG-CoA and glutaryl-CoA, which are generated in different pathways. We found proteins that are uniquely modified by each reactive metabolite, as well as common proteins and pathways. We identified the tricarboxylic acid cycle as a pathway commonly regulated by acylation and validated malate dehydrogenase as a key target. These data uncover a fundamental relationship between reactive acyl-CoA species and proteins and define a new regulatory paradigm in metabolism.Download high-res image (146KB)Download full-size image"

Separate domains of donor and acceptor material are mostly retained in the blend, although a small proportion of the acceptor, increasing with increasing donor concentration, is mixed in with the donor domains. Annealing in the nematic phase allows the donor and acceptor molecules to move and generate phase-separated domains of the required size, thus enhancing the performance of bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices based on these blends. We show that the optimum annealing temperature can be controlled by manipulation of the temperature range of the nematic phase of the donor."

In the 3D EBHM, a reasonable classification of nodes in periodic material microstructures is introduced to develop the 3D periodic boundary formulation consisting of 3D periodic boundary conditions, 3D boundary constraint equations and the reduced linearly elastic equilibrium equation. Then, the effective elasticity properties of material microstructures are evaluated by the average stress and strain theorems rather than the asymptotic theory. Meanwhile, the PLSM is applied to optimize microstructural shape and topology because of its positive characteristics, like the perfect demonstration of geometrical features and high optimization efficiency. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed design method. Results indicate that the optimized 3D material microstructures with expected effective properties are featured with smooth structural boundaries and clear interfaces."

The length of follow-up ranged from 4 months to 10 years with an average of 5 years. The surgical technique was described and the follow-up data was analyzed.There were no operation deaths and all flaps survived without any necrosis. Anastomosis leakage developed in three cases (ie, two that were small and healed spontaneously after cervical drainage, whereas the third needed surgical revision). Re-stenosis occurred between the transposed flap and the gullet in two cases, one of which was relieved by repeated esophageal dilations and the other one was resolved by reoperation. No ulceration or carcinogenesis was discovered in the skin paddle during the time of follow-up. Pathologic analysis showed that the keratin layer of the skin paddle became thinner but was still arranged in the same structure as that of the normal skin. At the end of the follow-up, all 28 patients gained body weight on a regular oral diet.Platysma myocutaneous flap can be accomplished in a single stage owning many advantages in comparison with other flaps for patch stricturoplasty in relieving the short and benign cervical esophageal stricture (ie, it is closer to the recipient site, thinner, pliable, and reliable)."
Nasal polyposis: Immunohistochemistry and bioelectrical findings (a hypothesis for the development of nasal polyps),"Joel M. Bernstein, Janet Gorfien, Bernice Noble, James R. Yankaskas, ","Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Volume 99, Issue 2, February 1997, Pages 165-175, ","Nasal polyps and turbinates were obtained from individuals undergoing surgery for symptomatic nasal obstruction caused by nonatopic rhinosinusitis or allergic rhinosinusitis. One part of the tissue from each patient was fixed in neutral buffered formalin and prepared for study by histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Monoclonal antibodies were used to identify macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. In most cases (12 of 16, 75%) the remainder of the polyp and turbinate samples was treated with protease to achieve disaggregation of the epithelial cells. Those cells were cultured on permeable collagen matrix supports. Transepithelial potential difference and resistance were measured daily. At the time of maximal transepithelial potential difference, the epithelial cells were mounted in modified Ussing chambers and exposed to a sodium-positive channel blocker (amiloride hydrochloride) and to selected chloride-negative channel agonists (isoproterenol bitartrate and adenosine triphosphate). Middle turbinates and polyps were found to have more macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells, HLA-DR每positive cells, and eosinophils than the inferior turbinates. Epithelial cells obtained from polyps exhibited higher transepithelial potential differences and equivalent short-circuit currents than turbinate cell cultures. The responses to amiloride, isoproterenol, and adenosine triphosphate were also greater for polyp than for turbinate cultures. A theory for the pathogenesis of nasal polyps is proposed. Local release of inflammatory mediators could cause sodium absorption and chloride permeability to be higher in polyps than in turbinate epithelia. Increased sodium absorption is consistent with the hypothesis that epithelial fluid absorption contributes to the development of nasal polyps and is a result of the increased recruitment of inflammatory cells, which are present in nasal polyps.

The symmetry of handaxes from the Danjiangkou Reservoir Region (central China): A methodological consideration,"Hao Li, Kathleen Kuman, Chaorong Li, ","Quaternary International, Volume 400, 2 May 2016, Pages 65-72, ","In this paper, we present a three-dimensional (3D) quantitative approach to measure the degree of symmetry of handaxes from the Danjiangkou Reservoir Region (DRR), central China. Our analysis provides not only information on the bilateral symmetry, as most previous studies have done, but also on the symmetry of the profile view. The results show that the overall degree of symmetry of handaxes in plan view is much higher than for profile views in the DRR assemblages. However, the range of values for deviation from absolute symmetry for each specimen indicates that both plan and profile views possess great variability in symmetry. Comparisons of handaxes from two terraces (the Middle Pleistocene Terrace 3 and the early Late Pleistocene Terrace 2) demonstrate that the degree of symmetry did not increase over time in these two samples. Both the type of blank and the type of shaping play roles in determining the final degree of symmetry of the DRR handaxes. According to these results, we argue that there is no strictly imposed final symmetrical shape for the DRR handaxes, and the degree of symmetry is most likely related to some basic factors (e.g., bilateral and bifacial shaping and blank types). However, although a mental template for a preferred end product is absent, a conceptual standardization did indeed exist."
"Large Cutting Tools from the Danjiangkou Reservoir Region, central China: Comparisons and contrasts with western and south Asian Acheulean","Kathleen Kuman, Hao Li, Chaorong Li, ","Quaternary International, Volume 400, 2 May 2016, Pages 58-64, ","The Danjiangkou Reservoir Region (DRR) in central China has been studied since 1994 and is known for its Large Cutting Tools (LCTs), with similarities to both western and south Asian LCTs of the Acheulean industrial complex. However, the origins of LCT technology in China is a much debated topic. In this paper, we address several of the major arguments used to support an indigenous development for eastern LCTs〞greater thickness, a poorer Refinement Index, greater weight, and a preference for cobbles over flakes for LCT blanks. In comparisons based on a large database of Acheulean LCTs, DRR examples are shown to compare well with Acheulean technology in terms of thickness and ＆refinement,＊ traits which we here link to raw material shapes and flaking properties. A relatively more frequent use of cobbles for blanks, however, characterizes the DRR and other Chinese LCTs, but there is also regional variability in this feature. Weight, on the other hand, is consistently larger for all Chinese LCTs, including those from DRR, although these fall at the low end of the range. Nevertheless, there are important features in common between Acheulean and Chinese LCTs which indicate either a common origin or periods of admixture culturally and probably physically. These features include the use of large flake blanks, the presence of cleavers in some industries, and the shaping of handaxes by both primary and secondary flaking. The influence of regional cultural traditions on Chinese material, geographic distance and limited migration routes, cultural drift, differences in subsistence ecology, and the demographics of small population sizes seem ultimately to be responsible for the differences, and they should not be used to obscure the commonalities."
Temporal change in megafauna at the Rose Garden hydrothermal vent (Galapagos Rift; eastern tropical Pacific),"Robert R. Hessler, William M. Smithey, Michel A. Boudrias, Clifford H. Keller, James J. Childress, ","Deep Sea Research Part A. Oceanographic Research Papers, Volume 35, Issues 10每11, October每November 1988, Pages 1681-1709, ","Hydrothermal vent communities must undergo substantial temporal change because of their dynamic physical milieu. This was verified in March 1985, when the Rose Garden hydrothermal vent on the Galapagos Rift was revisited after 514 years' absence. Comparison of photographs from the two visits revealed considerable faunal change. Among the hosts to chemoautotrophic bacteria, vestimentiferans were reduced from dominance to very low numbers. The mytilid was now extremely abundant and dominated vent openings. Vesicomyids also were more abundant. In general, vent-field suspension feeders had declined; anemones were distinctly less abundant, and siphonophores and enteropneusts were virtually absent. The decline of serpulids was likely, but less obvious. Of the mobile scavengers and carnivores, both galatheids and whelks were distincly more common.These community changes appear to result from both continuing recruitment and changes in the physical milieu. While the growth of some populations could have resulted from expanding opportunities, the population of at least one, the vesicomyid, had not achieved carrying capacity in 1979, and this could have pertained to others as well. The decrease of vestimentiferans may have been caused by declining vent-water flux, a process that would favor mytilids, or more complete vent-water filtration by the mytilids themselves. The same factors also could explain the reduction of vent-field filter feeders. These observations suggest that early stages in the cycle of Galapagos-type vent communities are likely to be dominated by vestimentiferans, but that bivalves will replace them with time."

In induced-fit docking study, compound 3 forms an edge-on interaction with Trp150 by slightly rotating the indole ring of Trp150, and compound 9 has additional hydrogen bond and 汛-羽 interactions with Leu135, which demonstrated the feasibility of our design strategy. Moreover, lead compounds 3 and 9 revealed improved polar surface area compared to GW9508, and have considerable hypoglycemic effects in mice. This structure-based study might inspire us to design more promising FFA1 agonists by increasing additional interactions with the residues outside of binding pocket.Aiming to further increasing the interactions with the lateral residues at the outside of binding pocket, the design strategy of incorporating series non-biphenyl scaffolds was developed, exemplified by the potent and orally bioavailable FFA1 agonists 3 and 9.Download high-res image (165KB)Download full-size image"

The fairly classical history of previous ectopic gestation, sudden abdominal pain, and physical findings of a tender adnexal mass in the first trimester were strongly suggestive. The subsidence of symptoms and continuation of pregnancy until the second trimester were unusual. The historical succession of events which included lack of quickening, unusual pelyic findings, and an atypical flat plate of the abdomen prompted an exploratory celiotomy.

ACTH-induced grooming involves high-affinity opiate receptors,"Adrian J. Dunn, Steven R. Childers, Neal R. Kramarcy, John W. Villiger, ","Behavioral and Neural Biology, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 1981, Pages 105-109, ","Naloxazone, an irreversible inhibitor of high-affinity opiate receptors was used to test whether excessive grooming in mice following intracerebroventricular ACTH involves interaction with high-affinity opiate receptors. ACTH-induced grooming was blocked 16 hr following naloxazone but not naloxone. At this time morphine-induced antinociception measured in the tail-immersion test was present in naloxone-, but not naloxazone-, treated mice. The deficit caused by naloxazone was not permanent, and 4 days later, ACTH again elicited excessive grooming. These results together with other published data suggest that ACTH induces excessive grooming by interaction with high-affinity cerebral opiate receptors."

In this Viewpoint, we review the history of naming and classifications used to define the disease now referred to as IPF, in the context of understanding the clinical presentation, causes, and pathogenesis of the disease. We aim to generate discussion on whether, given the substantial progress made in understanding the clinical, genetic, cellular, and molecular mechanisms involved in the development of IPF, a change of name should be considered. To initiate this discussion, we offer new suggestions to update the name of this disease and new approaches to classify all forms of pulmonary fibrosis."

During each period, it was noted whether the first interpretation of the radiographs was performed by a radiology resident, by an attending radiologist, or as a group effort including both an attending radiologist and a radiology resident(s). In addition, it was noted whether a radiology resident or an attending radiologist dictated the report.The proportion of images first interpreted by the radiology resident alone decreased from 38% (53 of 139) when using the conventional system to 17% (34 of 199) after the switch to interpreting images on the workstations (P = .001). During the film-based period, radiology residents dictated 45% of reports (141 of 312), but during the workstation period, radiology residents dictated only 4% of reports (24 of 667; P = .001).The authors observed a decrease in autonomous participation by radiology residents in image interpretation and dictation of reports and an increase in ※group reading§ after the switch from a film-based system to a workstation system."
Effect of intracoronary ultrasound imaging on clinical decision making,"Du-Yi Lee, Neal Eigler, Huai Luo, Toshihiko Nishioka, Robert J. Siegel, ","American Heart Journal, Volume 129, Issue 6, June 1995, Pages 1084-1093, ","The aim of this study was to determine the effect of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging on decision making in the performance of coronary interventions. One hundred lesions were assessed in 87 patients undergoing balloon or laser angioplasty, atherectomy, stent placement, and additional diagnostic examination. Angiographically acceptable results were deemed inadequate by IVUS in 29% of angioplasties and 30% of stent deployments, and planned procedures subsequently were altered. Abnormalities commonly identified by IVUS and not by angiography were 13 coronary dissections after the procedure and 14 significant stenoses in apparently normal angiograms and significant stenoses were excluded in 7 patients with ambiguous angiograms. The apparent contribution of coronary IVUS imaging led to its significantly increased use over a 1-year period, as coronary interventional decisions on the basis of IVUS findings increased from 4 (17%) of 19 to 60 (74%) of 81. These data suggest that IVUS is a useful adjunct to angiography in selected patients for (1) identification or exclusion of dissection, (2) assessment of the adequacy of balloon angioplasty, (3) identification or exclusion of thrombus, (4) measurement of the depth of tissue removal, (5) determination of stent size and the result of stent deployment, and (6) assessment of the severity of stenoses, especially at ostial sites."

Development of a Mandibular Motion Simulator for Total Joint Replacement,"Nukhet Celebi, E. Carlos Rohner, Jaime Gateno, Philip C. Noble, James J. Xia, ","Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Volume 69, Issue 1, January 2011, Pages 66-79, ","The purpose of this study was to develop a motion simulator capable of recreating and recording the full range of mandibular motions in a cadaveric preparation for an intact temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and after total joint replacement.A human cadaver head was used. Two sets of tracking balls were attached to the forehead and mandible, respectively. Computed tomographic (CT) scan was performed and 3-dimensional CT models of the skull were generated. The cadaver head was then dissected to attach the muscle activation cables and mounted onto the TMJ simulator. Realistic jaw motions were generated through the application of the following muscle forces: lateral pterygoid muscle, suprahyoid depressors (geniohyoid, mylohyoid, and digastric muscles), and elevator muscles. To simulate muscle contraction, cables were inserted into the mandible at the center area of each muscle's attachment. To provide a minimum mouth closing force at the initial position, the elevator muscles were combined at the anterior mandible. During mandibular movement, each motion was recorded using a high-resolution laser scanner. The right TMJ of the same head was reconstructed with a total TMJ prosthesis. The same forces were applied and the jaw motions were recorded again. CT scan was performed and 3-dimensional CT models of the skull with TMJ prosthesis were generated.Mandibular motions, before and after TMJ replacement, with and without lateral pterygoid muscle reattachment, were re-created in a cadaveric preparation. The laser-scanned data during the mandibular motion were used to drive 3-dimensional CT models. A movie for each mandibular motion was subsequently created for motion path analysis. Compared with mandibular motion before TMJ replacement, mandibular lateral and protrusive motions after TMJ replacement, with and without lateral pterygoid muscle reattachment, were greatly limited. The jaw motion recorded before total joint replacement was applied to the mandibular and prostheses models after total TMJ replacement. The condylar component was observed sinking into the fossa during jaw motion.A motion simulator capable of re-creating and recording full range of mandibular motions in a cadaveric preparation has been developed. It can be used to simulate mandibular motions for the intact TMJ and total joint prosthesis, and to re-create and record their full range of mandibular motions. In addition, the full range of the recorded motion can be re-created as motion images in a computer. These images can be used for motion path analysis and to study the causation of limited range of motion after total joint replacement and strategies for improvement."
Everolimus for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: 2-year open-label extension of the randomised EXIST-1 study,"David Neal Franz, Elena Belousova, Steven Sparagana, E Martina Bebin, Sergiusz Jozwiak, ","The Lancet Oncology, Volume 15, Issue 13, December 2014, Pages 1513-1520, ","In the EXIST-1 trial, initiated on Aug 10, 2009, more than 35% of patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex had at least 50% reduction in SEGA volume after 9﹞6 months of treatment with everolimus. In this Article, we report interim data (up to Jan 11, 2013) to support longer-term tolerability and efficacy of everolimus from the continuing 4-year extension phase of EXIST-1.We assessed data from a prospective, open-label extension of a multicentre, phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex who had SEGA that was growing and needed treatment. In this extension study, we included all patients who had been assigned everolimus during the double-blind, randomised phase of the trial and those patients who crossed over from the placebo group to receive everolimus during the randomised phase or at the start of the extension phase. All patients received oral everolimus at a starting dose of 4﹞5 mg/m2 per day. Everolimus dose was subsequently adjusted subject to tolerability to attain blood trough concentrations of 5每15 ng/mL. An independent central radiology review team assessed SEGA response (at least a 50% reduction from baseline in total volume of all target SEGAs; the primary endpoint) by MRI at 12, 24, and 48 weeks, then every year thereafter in all patients who received at least one dose of everolimus. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00789828.Of the original 117 randomly assigned patients, 111 were given everolimus between Aug 20, 2009, and Jan 11, 2013 (date of data cutoff); we included these patients in our longer-term analysis. Median duration of everolimus exposure was 29﹞3 months (IQR 19﹞4每33﹞8). Median follow-up was 28﹞3 months (IQR 19﹞3每33﹞0). 54 (49%) patients had a response of 50% or greater reduction in SEGA volume (95% CI 39﹞0每58﹞3), and duration of response was between 2﹞1 and 31﹞1 months (median not reached). SEGA volume was reduced by 50% or more in 39 (37%) of 105 patients at 24 weeks, 48 (46%) of 104 patients at 48 weeks, 36 (47%) of 76 patients at 96 weeks, and 11 (38%) of 29 patients at 144 weeks. Stomatitis (48 [43%] patients) and mouth ulceration (33 [30%] patients) were the most frequent treatment-related adverse events; infections were the most commonly reported treatment-related serious adverse event, occurring in 15 (14%) patients. 35 (32%) patients reported treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events, the most common of which were stomatitis (nine [8%]) and pneumonia (nine [8%]). 18 (16%) patients had treatment-related serious adverse events. Six (5%) patients withdrew because of adverse events.These results support the longer-term use of everolimus in patients who have few treatment options and who need continued treatment for tuberous sclerosis complex and its varied manifestations. Reduction or stabilisation of tumour volume with everolimus will hopefully provide long-term clinical benefit in patients with SEGA.Novartis Pharmaceuticals."

Three mammalian genes, CP2, LBP-1a and LBP-9 have been previously identified as homologues of grainyhead. We now report the cloning of two new mammalian genes (Mammalian grainyhead (MGR) and Brother-of-MGR (BOM)) and one new Drosophila gene (dCP2) that rewrite the phylogeny of this family. We demonstrate that MGR and BOM are more closely related to grh, whereas CP2, LBP-1a and LBP-9 are descendants of the dCP2 gene. MGR shares the greatest sequence homology with grh, is expressed in tissue-restricted patterns more comparable to grh and binds to and transactivates the promoter of the human Engrailed-1 gene, the mammalian homologue of the key grainyhead target gene, engrailed. This sequence and functional conservation indicates that the new mammalian members of this family play important developmental roles."

Kaczorowski, ","Neurobiology of Aging, Volume 46, October 2016, Pages 58-67, ","An individual's genetic makeup plays an important role in determining susceptibility to cognitive aging. Identifying the specific genes that contribute to cognitive aging may aid in early diagnosis of at-risk patients, as well as identify novel therapeutics targets to treat or prevent development of symptoms. Challenges to identifying these specific genes in human studies include complex genetics, difficulty in controlling environmental factors, and limited access to human brain tissue. Here, we identify Hp1bp3 as a novel modulator of cognitive aging using a genetically diverse population of mice and confirm that HP1BP3 protein levels are significantly reduced in the hippocampi of cognitively impaired elderly humans relative to cognitively intact controls. Deletion of functional Hp1bp3 in mice recapitulates memory deficits characteristic of aged impaired mice and humans, further supporting the idea that Hp1bp3 and associated molecular networks are modulators of cognitive aging. Overall, our results suggest Hp1bp3 may serve as a potential target against cognitive aging and demonstrate the utility of genetically diverse animal models for the study of complex human disease."

Whether similar associations exist among un-selected PCI patients is unknown.We used data from the EVENT (Evaluation of Drug Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events) registry〞a multicenter registry of unselected patients undergoing PCI〞to examine the association between both in-hospital bleeding and pMI and 1-year mortality. Cardiac enzyme levels were assessed in all patients, and pMI was defined as a peak creatine kinase-MB value ≡3℅ the upper limit of normal. Post-PCI bleeding was classified by Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction criteria.After excluding patients with elevated pre-PCI creatine kinase-MB values and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction at presentation (n = 1,626), a total of 5,961 patients were available for evaluation. Rates of post-PCI bleeding and pMI were 3.0% and 7.1%, respectively; 1-year all-cause mortality was 2.8%. After multivariable adjustment, both post-PCI bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 3.83, 95% confidence interval: 2.48 to 5.90, p < 0.001) and pMI (adjusted HR: 1.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 2.89, p = 0.009) were independently associated with 1-year mortality. Time period-specific analyses demonstrated that the adjusted HR for bleeding was similar for 30-day mortality and mortality between 1 month and 1 year, while the adjusted HR for pMI was greater for 30-day mortality as compared with mortality between 1 month and 1 year.Among unselected PCI patients, both post-PCI bleeding and pMI are independently associated with increased 1-year mortality. Continued efforts to reduce these complications after PCI are warranted."

Morphometric analysis of horizontal canal nerves of chronically diabetic rats,"STEVEN F. MYERS, MARY C. TORMEY, SUSAN AKL, ","Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Volume 120, Issue 2, February 1999, Pages 174-179, ","Horizontal canal nerves of 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month-diabetic rats were compared with those of age-matched controls. The myelin sheaths of the horizontal canal nerves in diabetic rats were thinner than those of age-matched controls (mean ㊣ SD 0.63 ㊣ 0.04 米m [n = 16] vs. 0.71 ㊣ 0.05 米m [n = 9]; p < 0.0001, one-tailed t test). Regression analysis revealed that myelin sheath thickness did not correlate with severity of diabetes, but myelin thinning did occur as a function of the duration of diabetes (p < 0.05, regression ANOVA). The progression of myelin thinning over time is consistent with the possibility of an accelerated decline in vestibular function with age in diabetic patients. That myelin thinning did not correlate with the severity of diabetes suggests that this thinning is not directly related to the aging effects attributed to nonenzymatic glycosylation of myelin proteins. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant difference between diabetic and control groups when fiber diameter and intrasheath diameter were considered together (p < 0.008, canonical discriminant-function analysis). Diabetic and control groups did not differ significantly in total nerve fiber counts. In the diabetic group, however, nerve fiber counts were higher in animals with higher blood glucose levels (p < 0.02, linear-regression ANOVA; r2 = 0.49). The finding of higher nerve fiber counts in more severely diabetic rats is consistent with an earlier transmission electron microscopic finding of false myelinated nerve fiber profiles in micrographs from more severely diabetic rats. These false profiles are believed to represent phagocytosis-like Schwann cell reactions against their own myelin, triggered by excess myelin glycosylation.

Enzymatic phosphorylation of acyclic nucleoside analogs and correlations with antiherpetic activities,"Paul M. Keller, James A. Fyfe, Lilia Beauchamp, Carol M. Lubbers, Gertrude B. Elion, ","Biochemical Pharmacology, Volume 30, Issue 22, 15 November 1981, Pages 3071-3077, ","The inhibitor and substrate specificities of deoxythymidine (dThd) kinase purified from herpes simplex virus (HSV Type 1) were studied. A number of nucleosides and nucleoside analogs were phosphorylated by the virus coded enzyme. These included several compounds structurally related to 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine (acyclovir), a potent inhibitor of HSV replication. Some contained guanine with 9-substituents differing from that of acyclovir by methylene additions, methylene and thioether substitutions for the ether oxygen, and branching on the distal side of the ether oxygen. Others were various 2-substituted 6-hydroxypurines with the 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl) substituent. A limitation of the specificity of the enzyme with guanine derivatives was the lack of phosphorylation of any derivative with an acyclic moiety branched on the proximal side of the ether oxygen. Many of the compounds that were phosphorylated were subsequently found to inhibit HSV replication. Such compounds apparently inhibited HSV replication via the same route of activation previously described for acyclovir [G. B. Elion, P. A. Furman, J. A. Fyfe, P. de Miranda, L. Beauchamp and H. J. Schaeffer, Proc. natn. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.74, 5716 (1977)]. Moreover, several compounds not phosphorylated by the enzyme did not inhibit replication. However, some other acyclic nucleoside analogs that were phosphorylated were not good antivirals, indicating that phosphorylation catalyzed by the HSV dThd kinase was not sufficient for inhibition of viral replication to occur. These results emphasize the importance of the specificity of cellular kinases and the HSV DNA polymerase to the mechanism of antiviral activity. The dThd kinase from Vero cells was also purified. With this host cell enzyme, kinetic constants of known antiviral compounds were determined and compared to those of dThd (relative V∩max; k∩m): dThd (100; 1.3 米M), 5-iodo-2∩-deoxyuridine (87; 1.8 米M), 5-trifluoromethyl-2∩-deoxyuridine (91; 1.2 米M), 5-bromo-2∩-deoxycytidine (5; 580 米M), and 9-汕-d-arabinofuransoylthymine (23; 2300 米M). None of the purine acyclic nucleoside analogs tested (at 1000 米M) was detectably phosphorylated by the Vero cell enzyme, and all had apparent Ki values >300 米M. The phosphorylation catalyzed by host cell dThd kinase correlated with the toxicity of some pyrimidine nucleoside analogs."
3-Deazaadenosine 5∩-triphosphate: A novel metabolite of 3-deazaadenosine in mouse leukocytes,"Karen L. Prus, Gerald Wolberg, Paul M. Keller, James A. Fyfe, Thomas P. Zimmerman, ","Biochemical Pharmacology, Volume 38, Issue 3, 1 February 1989, Pages 509-517, ","Evidence has been obtained for the metabolic formation of small amounts (1每2% of the ATP pool) of 3-deazaadenosine 5∩-triphosphate (c3ATP) from 3-deazaadenosine (c3Ado) in mouse cytolytic lymphocytes and mouse resident peritoneal macrophages. With intact leukocytes, pharmacological evidence was obtained that adenosine kinase was not the enzyme chiefly responsible for the phosphorylation of c3Ado. Moreover, in the presence of MgCl2, NaCI and IMP, purified rat liver 5∩-nucleotidase catalyzed the phosphorylation of c3Ado to 3-deazaadenosine 5∩-monophosphate (c3AMP). Two lines of evidence suggest that the metabolic formation of c3ATP is not involved in the inhibition of leukocyte function caused by c3Ado. First, the inhibitory action of c3Ado on antibody-dependent phagocytosis and lymphocyte-mediated cytolysis was reversed markedly upon removal of the drug from the medium. However, the intracellular content of c3ATP remained constant in lymphocytes and macrophages after removal of c3Ado. Second, in macrophages and in lymphocytes, similar intracellular amounts of c3ATP were formed from both c3Ado and 3-deazaadenine under conditions in which the former was biologically active and the latter was essentially inactive. Thus, it appears unlikely that the novel c3ATP metabolite is of relevance for the mechanism of action of c3Ado in mouse leukocytes."
Successful prosthetic fitting of a 73-year-old hip disarticulation amputee patient with cardiopulmonary disease,"Robert D. McAnelly, Manouchehr Refaeian, Dennis G. O'Connell, Gregory D. Powell, Nicolas E. Walsh, ","Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Volume 79, Issue 5, May 1998, Pages 585-588, ","Patients with hip disarticulation (HD) require high energy expenditure for successful prosthetic ambulation. Thus, older patients are rarely fitted with an HD prosthesis. To our knowledge there are no reports of gait analysis following successful prosthetic fitting of an elderly HD amputee patient with systemic cardiopulmonary disease. We report the case of successful prosthetic ambulation in a 73-year-old man with HD secondary to histiosarcoma and a medical history significant for stable angina, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes mellitus. The patient underwent gait training with an endoskeletal prosthesis and achieved ambulation to 400 feet with bilateral forearm crutches. Vicon kinematic gait analysis revealed a cadence of 44steps/min (112steps/min normal), and double support time of 47% (26% normal). Oxygen rate during ambulation (Vo2) was 11.0mL/kg/min at velocity of .35m/sec, compared with published figures for ambulation in those with HD of 10.73mL/kg/min at velocity of .93m/sec. At 1-year follow-up, the patient continued to walk into church with the prosthesis. We conclude that a trial fitting of an HD prosthesis should be considered on an individual basis in elderly amputee patients."

Compared with Green＊s kernel function method (GKFM), SFM_MLSF approximates load more smoothly, so the ill-posedness is improved. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of SFM_MLSF."
Lattice Boltzmann simulation of liquid flow in nanoporous media,"Jianlin Zhao, Qinjun Kang, Jun Yao, Lei Zhang, Hai Sun, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 125, October 2018, Pages 1131-1143, ","In this paper, a multi-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for nanoscale liquid flow is established to investigate the liquid flow characteristics in nanoporous media. The slip length and effective viscosity obtained by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are adopted to account for the nanoscale effect. First, the LB model for water flow in nanopores is built and water flow characteristics in nanoporous media are investigated. The fluid-solid interaction force shows significant influence on water flow in nanoporous media. The water flux through nanoporous media increases with the decrease of fluid-solid interaction force. In hydrophobic nanoporous media, the nanoscale effect can decrease the gap between water flow resistance in large pores and that in small pores, making the velocity distribution more uniform. In addition, the end effect caused by the bending of streamlines can induce significant additional flow resistance. Neglecting the end effect can greatly overestimate water flow ability. The pore structure also has significant influence on water flow in nanoporous media. With the increase of specific interfacial length, the nanoscale effect increases. Finally, the LB model for oil (octane) flow in quartz nanopores is also established by incorporating the MD simulation results. Oil flow simulation in quartz nanoporous media shows that the conclusions obtained for water flow are also applicable for oil flow."
Resolving dark matter subhalos with future sub-GeV gamma-ray telescopes,"Ti-Lin Chou, Dimitrios Tanoglidis, Dan Hooper, ","Physics of the Dark Universe, Volume 21, September 2018, Pages 1-7, ","Annihilating dark matter particles in nearby subhalos could generate potentially observable fluxes of gamma rays, unaccompanied by emission at other wavelengths. Furthermore, this gamma-ray emission is expected to be spatially extended, providing us with a powerful way to discriminate dark matter subhalos from other astrophysical gamma-ray sources. Fermi has detected two dark matter subhalo candidates which exhibit a statistically significant degree of spatial extension (3FGL J2212.5+0703 and 3FGL J1924.8-1034). It has been argued that the most likely non-dark matter interpretation of these observations is that they are each in fact multiple nearby point sources, too close to one another on the sky to be individually resolved. In this study, we consider the ability of next generation gamma-ray telescopes to spatially resolve the gamma-ray emission from subhalo candidates, focusing on the proposed e-ASTROGAM mission. We find that such an instrument could significantly clarify the nature of Fermi＊s dark matter subhalo candidates, and provide an unprecedented level of sensitivity to the presence of annihilating dark matter in nearby subhalos."
Assessing Compliance with National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines for Elderly Patients with Stage III Colon Cancer: The Fox Chase Cancer Center Partners' Initiative,"Margaret A. O'Grady, Elyse Slater, Elin R. Sigurdson, Neal J. Meropol, Steven J. Cohen, ","Clinical Colorectal Cancer, Volume 10, Issue 2, June 2011, Pages 113-116, ","Fox Chase Cancer Center Partners (FCCCP) performs an annual quality review of affiliate practices based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Given recent treatment advances, we initiated this medical record review in elderly patients with stage III colon cancer to measure compliance with these guidelines.Medical records of 124 patients age ≡ 65 diagnosed with stage III colon cancer between 2003 and 2006 were reviewed. Metrics were developed and based on NCCN guidelines for workup and staging, treatment, and gerontology. Documentation was reviewed via paper (13 sites) and electronic record (2 sites).High compliance with staging and workup guidelines was noted with chest imaging (100%), stage (98%), computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis (93%), pathology (91%), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; 91%). Activities of daily living were documented commonly (83%) but colonoscopy less (75%). Age and life expectancy were discussed with the patient in only 49%. Nearly all patients (123 of 124 patients) received adjuvant chemotherapy, with 76 patients (61%) receiving oxaliplatin. Common regimens were FOLFOX (oxaliplatin plus infusional/bolus 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid) 54%, 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV; 19%), and capecitabine (12%). Reasons for excluding oxaliplatin were comorbidity (68%), age (19%), and not specified (13%). Three-quarters of the patients had ≡ 12 lymph nodes sampled and 56% identified the radial margin. Nearly all patients (115 = 93%) received surveillance with history and physical and CEA. Surveillance CT was performed in 78% of the patients.A quality review of community oncology practices can assess implementation of treatment advances. Guideline compliance for elderly patients with stage III colon cancer is generally high. Forty percent did not receive oxaliplatin and documentation of life expectancy was infrequent. Further study of oncologist decision making for elderly colon cancer patients is warranted."
Changes in resting connectivity with age: a simultaneous electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation,"Joshua Henk Balsters, Redmond G. O'Connell, Alessandra Galli, Hugh Nolan, Ian H. Robertson, ","Neurobiology of Aging, Volume 34, Issue 9, September 2013, Pages 2194-2207, ","Resting fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal have attracted considerable interest for their sensitivity to pathological brain processes. However, these analyses are susceptible to confound by nonneural physiological factors such as vasculature, breathing, and head movement which is a concern when investigating elderly or pathological groups. Here, we used simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (EEG/fMRI) to constrain the analysis of resting state networks (RSNs) and identify aging differences. Four of 26 RSNs showed fMRI and EEG/fMRI group differences; anterior default-mode network, left frontal-parietal network, bilateral middle frontal, and postcentral gyri. Seven RSNs showed only EEG/fMRI differences suggesting the combination of these 2 methods might be more sensitive to age-related neural changes than fMRI alone. Five RSNs showed only fMRI differences and might reflect nonneural group differences. Activity within some EEG/fMRI RSNs was better explained by neuropsychological measures (Mini Mental State Examination and Stroop) than age. These results support previous studies suggesting that age-related changes in specific RSNs are neural in origin, and show that changes in some RSNs relate better to elderly cognition than age."

We use Pearson＊s differential equation as a way for orthogonal polynomials construction and solution. The generalized Rodrigues formula is used for this goal. Deriving the weight function of the differential equation, we use it as a basic distribution density of variables like financial asset returns or insurance claim sizes. In this general setting, we derive explicit formulas for option prices as well as for insurance premiums. The numerical analysis shows that our new models provide a better fit than some previous actuarial and financial models."

Chapter Two: Brain PET Imaging in the Cannabinoid System,"Dean F. Wong, Ayon Nandi, Eram Zaidi, Emily Gean, James R. Brasic, ","Imaging of the Human Brain in Health and Disease, 2014, Pages 27-36, ","The cannabinoid system constitutes a key entity throughout the human body. The cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R), the prominent cannabinoid component in the brain, interacts significantly with the dopaminergic system and its role in reward. CB1Rs have been implicated in ※reward disorders§ such as obesity and substance abuse, as well as in schizophrenia and mood disorders. The further exploration of the role of these receptors is important for a general knowledge of the brain and, ultimately, for the development of drugs to target associated diseases. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging allows for the investigation of specific receptors in vivo. PET radioligands targeted to the specific receptor type are essential. The development of effective radiotracers for imaging CB1R has been met with challenges, due to poor blood brain permeability, nonspecificity and fast washout. The current chapter provides a review of the three CB1R PET radioligands available for use to investigate the cannabinoid system in humans in health and disease."

Some models for generating and ranking multiplicative weights,"Jian Lin, JiBin Lan, Yong Jiang, ","Computers & Industrial Engineering, Volume 65, Issue 4, August 2013, Pages 586-593, ","The ranking of multiplicative interval and fuzzy weights is often necessary in multiplicative analytic hierarchy process. The existing ranking method is found flawed and needs to be revised. Firstly, this paper presents a correct formula for ranking multiplicative interval weights, and offers the relevant properties and lemmas to support them. Secondly, since different rank orders of interval weights are derived by the two-stage logarithmic goal programming (TLGP) method under different 汐-cuts, an approximation and adjustment (AAM) method is developed to generate multiplicative triangular fuzzy weights. In order to compare two multiplicative triangular fuzzy weights, the geometric mean centroid of multiplicative triangular fuzzy weight is proposed. Thus, a practical algorithm for decision making is introduced based on the above model and formulas. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the practicality and validity of the proposed method."
Unsuspected Chlamydia trachomatis infection and in vitro fertilization outcome,"Steven S. Witkin, Khalid M. Sultan, Gregory S. Neal, Jan Jeremias, Zev Rosenwaks, ","American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Volume 171, Issue 5, November 1994, Pages 1208-1214, ","Objective:Chlamydia trachomatis infections of the female genital tract, although a major cause of infertility, are often asymptomatic and undetected. Since many infertile women now seek in vitro fertilization, a procedure whereby fertilization and embryo implantation are precisely timed, we sought to determine the relation between an unsuspected C. trachomatis infection and the ability of embryos to implant and develop after their transfer to the uterus.Study Design: At the time of oocyte aspiration, endocervical samples were obtained from 216 women and assayed by enzyme-linked immunoassay for immunoglobulin A antibodies to C. trachomatis structural membrane components and to recombinant C. trachomatis heat shock protein. The presence of C. trachomatis in the cervices was assessed by the polymerase chain reaction. The outcome of each in vitro fertilization cycle was then ascertained.Results: Oocytes from 198 (91.7%) of the women were fertilized in vitro and subsequently transferred to the uterus. Term deliveries of healthy infants occurred after 68 (34.3%) of these transfers. Cervical immunoglobulin A antibodies to chlamydial heat shock protein were detected in 5 (7.3%) of the women with term births, and 1 (1.5%) also had immunoglobulin A antibody to chlamydial structural components; 3 (4.4%) were positive by the polymerase chain reaction for C. trachomatis. In contrast, among the 130 women whose embryo transfers did not result in an ongoing pregnancy, 36 (27.7%) had cervical antiheat shock protein immunoglobulin A (p = 0.0007) and 24 (18.5%) had antichlamydial structural component immunoglobulin A (p = 0.0002); 15 (11.5%) of these women had positive results of polymerase chain reaction for C. trachomatis. The majority of women with cervical antibodies to chlamydial structural antigens were also positive for antibody to heat shock protein. However, only 35% of the women with antibodies to heat shock protein were also positive for the other chlamydial antibodies. C. trachomatis was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 29.2% of women with anti-C. trachomatis antibodies and 7.8% of women with anti-heat shock protein antibodies. Women positive for antichlamydial immunoglobulin A were more likely to be undergoing a repeat in vitro fertilization cycle than were women who were antibody negative (p = 0.007).Conclusion: Unsuspected C. trachomatis infection or reactivation of an immune response to the C. trachomatis heat shock protein may induce an inflammatory reaction in the uterus that impairs embryo implantation and/or facilitates immune rejection after uterine transfer of in vitro fertilized embryos."
ANATOMICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URETHRA AND CLITORIS,"HELEN E. O'CONNELL, JOHN M. HUTSON, COLIN R. ANDERSON, ROBERT J. PLENTER, ","The Journal of Urology, Volume 159, Issue 6, June 1998, Pages 1892-1897, ","We investigated the anatomical relationship between the urethra and the surrounding erectile tissue, and reviewed the appropriateness of the current nomenclature used to describe this anatomy.A detailed dissection was performed on 2 fresh and 8 fixed human female adult cadavers (age range 22 to 88 years). The relationship of the urethra to the surrounding erectile tissue was ascertained in each specimen, and the erectile tissue arrangement was determined and compared to standard anatomical descriptions. Nerves supplying the erectile tissue were carefully preserved and their relationship to the soft tissues and bony pelvis was noted.The female urethra, distal vaginal wall and erectile tissue are packed into the perineum caudal (superficial) to the pubic arch, which is bounded laterally by the ischiopubic rami, and superficially by the labia minora and majora. This complex is not flat against the rami as is commonly depicted but projects from the bony landmarks for 3 to 6 cm. The perineal urethra is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall and is surrounded by erectile tissue in all directions except posteriorly where it relates to the vaginal wall. The bulbs of the vestibule are inappropriately named as they directly relate to the other clitoral components and the urethra. Their association with the vestibule is inconsistent and, thus, we recommend that these structures be renamed the bulbs of the clitoris.A series of detailed dissections suggest that current anatomical descriptions of female human urethral and genital anatomy are inaccurate."

Elastin was found in the following ocular structures: conjunctiva, muscle tendons, sclera, choroid, and meninges. The elastin in the sclera was most dense in a ring surrounding the peripapillary optic nerve head, with its presence in the inner sclera declining with greater distance from the nerve head. Elastin fibers were oriented in the sclera along what would be expected to be the principal stress directions generated from the intraocular pressure, though actual biomechanical measurements have not yet been made in the mouse sclera. Elastin comprises a portion of the mouse sclera and its distribution in the peripapillary area is similar to that in human eyes."
The assessment of tumor response to irradiation of lung cancer: Continuous versus split-course regimes,"Omar M. Salazar, Philip Rubin, James C. Brown, Michael L. Feldstein, Bowen E. Keller, ","International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics, Volume 1, Issues 11每12, November每December 1976, Pages 1107-1118, ","From February 1972 to July 1975, 200 lung cancer patients were seen in the University of Rochester Cancer Center's Division of Radiation Oncology; 40% had squamous cell tumors and 87.5% had advanced disease localized to the thorax. Of the 160 patients who completed treatment, 101 were treated with four different continuous therapy schedules; 59 were treated with three different split-course schedules. The patients who were treated with split-courses were compared with those who were treated continuously; those treated with split courses had higher nominal standard dose (NSD) ret doses, higher percentage of tumor resolution per histological type, milder radiation toxicity, decreased incidence of focal failures, and a better survival rate. Although, in order to achieve over 90% tumor sterilization, the most effective treatment dose seems to be above 6000 rad, the most efficient treatment schedules were split courses which delivered lower total tumor doses. Doubling times were obtained in measurable lesions to assess local tumor response. More than 50% tumor shadow regression was a good prognosticator of local tumor response; it increased as the mean DT decreased. One month after therapy, the survival rate associated with a tumor shadow of more than 50% was statistically better than that associated with tumors exhibiting less than 50% shadow regression. However, survival rates in lung cancer are simplistic and are inadequate to explain how local tumors are controlled by irradiation. A selective population of patients with cancers of the same stage and histology and with measurable lesions is the basis of a proposed study group to investigate local effectiveness of radiation therapy in primary lung cancers."
"An ERR汕/污 agonist modulates GR汐 expression, and glucocorticoid responsive gene expression in skeletal muscle cells","Shu-Ching Mary Wang, Stephen Myers, Cedric Dooms, Robert Capon, George E. O. Muscat, ","Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology, Volume 315, Issues 1每2, 5 February 2010, Pages 146-152, ","Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) are constitutively active orphan nuclear receptors. Natural ligands have not been identified, however, recent reports have demonstrated the synthetic phenolic acyl hydrazone, GSK4716, functions as a selective ERR汕/污 agonist. We demonstrate that ERR汕 is transiently induced, and ERR污 is dramatically induced (and accumulates) in a differentiation-dependent manner in skeletal muscle cells. Treatment of differentiated skeletal muscle cells with the ERR汕/污 agonist (GSK4716) produced a significant increase in the expression of GR汐 (isoform D) protein. Quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) analysis after treatment with GSK4716, revealed induction of the mRNAs encoding the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), 11汕-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11汕-HSD1), the enzyme that converts inactive cortisone to cortisol and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase expression (H6PDH) that stimulates oxoreduction by 11汕-HSD1. Candidate based expression profiling also demonstrated the mRNAs encoding characterized GR target genes, including C/EBP, ApoD and Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) are induced in GSK4716 treated cells. In concordance with these observations, siRNA-mediated suppression of the mRNA encoding ERR污 (but not ERR汐 and 汕) attenuated the expression of mRNAs encoding GR, 11汕HSD1 and GR target gene(s). Similarly, treatment with the ERR污 (and ER汐) antagonist diethylstilbestrol (DES) suppressed glucocorticoid responsive gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. Interestingly, we observed that GSK4716 trans-activated GRE-TK-LUC in a GR-dependent manner. This study highlights the regulatory crosstalk between ERR污 and GR signaling in skeletal muscle cells, and suggests the ERR污 agonist modulates the expression of critical genes that control GR signaling and glucocorticoid sensitive gene expression."

Because of the increasing knowledge in the understanding of its molecular pathways, a reproducible and stable growth set-up for obtaining uniform plants becomes more important. In order to be able to easily harvest and study both roots and shoots, and to allow simple exposure to water-soluble toxic substances, a hydroponic system is the desired cultivation method for controlled plant growth. Based on earlier developed hydroponic cultivation protocols, a hydroponic set-up was optimized and statistically validated using linear mixed-effects models. In order to determine important components that influence the level of variability in a hydroponic set-up, stress-related indicators were examined at the biochemical as well as at the molecular level. It is highly recommended that statistical as well as biological assumptions are carried out before post-analyses are performed. Therefore, we suggest a model where factors that influence variability such as the usage of different pots and harvesting on different times are taken into account in the analyses. Furthermore, in contrast to what has been reported in earlier studies, our findings indicate that continuous aeration of the hydroponic solution is highly important."
Optimization design of corrugated beam guardrail based on RBF-MQ surrogate model and collision safety consideration,"Shujuan Hou, Wei Tan, Yuna Zheng, Xu Han, Qing Li, ","Advances in Engineering Software, Volume 78, December 2014, Pages 28-40, ","As the main safety facility on the highway, a guardrail system is very essential for the highway traffics safety. In this paper, the Finite Element (FE) models of the vehicle and the corrugated beam guardrail system were created. Two types of widely used corrugated beam semi-rigid guardrails were simulated, which were the W-beam guardrail and the Thrie-beam guardrail. The collision between the corrugated beam guardrail systems and the vehicle body was analyzed. In the collision process, the snagging effect of the post to the vehicle body was also concerned. Under the considerations of the collision safety and the mechanism of the snagging effect, the multiobjective optimization problem was defined with dimensional sizes of guardrails to be the design variables. And the radial basis function (RBF) was applied to construct the regression models of the analytical objective, which increased the accuracy of fitting. The Pareto set and the optimal solution were obtained. After the optimization design, the W-beam guardrail and Thrie-beam guardrail were both greatly improved, that increased the collision safety between the corrugated beam guardrail and the vehicle body. This kind of analytical method can also be used for the crashworthiness optimization between any other cars and guardrails."

Left ventricular mass was calculated from left ventricular myocardial volume and compared with the left ventricular weight determined after formalin immersion-fixation.Linear regression analysis yielded the following relation in grams: left ventricular mass determined using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging = (0.94) (left ventricular weight) + 9.1 (r = 0.98, SEE = 6.1 g). The small overestimation of left ventricular weight by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging was judged to be secondary to both difficulty with proper border definition and partial volume effects. Hence, this imaging technique can be used to obtain accurate measurements of left ventricular mass in dogs in vivo."

The full development and evolution process, including the formation of Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices, breakdown of large-scale structures and establishment of self-similar turbulence, is exhibited clearly in the experiments, which can give a qualitative graphically comparing for the DNS and LES results. The shocklets are first captured at this low convective Mach number, and their generation mechanisms are elaborated and analyzed. The convective velocity derived from two images with space-time correlations is well consistent with the theoretical result. The pairing and merging process of large-scale vortices in transition region is clearly revealed in the velocity vector field. The analysis of turbulent statistics indicates that in weakly compressible mixing layers, with the increase of convective Mach number, the peak values of streamwise turbulence intensity and Reynolds shear stress experience a sharp decrease, while the anisotropy ratio seems to keep quasi unchanged. The normalized growth rate of the present experiments shows a well agreement with former experimental and DNS data. The validation of present experimental results is important for that in the future the present work can be a reference for assessing the accuracy of numerical data."
Upregulated expression of CAP1 is associated with tumor migration and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Yanhua Liu, Xiaopeng Cui, Baoying Hu, Cuihua Lu, Runzhou Ni, ","Pathology - Research and Practice, Volume 210, Issue 3, March 2014, Pages 169-175, ","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers that exhibits high incidences of intrahepatic metastasis and tumor recurrence. Adenylate cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), a protein involved in the regulation of actin filaments, was recently reported to play a role in cell motility and the pathology of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we examined a potential role of CAP1 in HCC progression, and found that CAP1 was overexpressed in HCC specimens compared with adjacent noncancerous liver tissues by Western blot analysis and real-time PCR assay. Further, immunohistochemical analysis in 107 HCC specimens revealed that overexpression of CAP1 was closely correlated only with tumor metastasis, but not with other clinicopathologic parameters. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses showed that CAP1 could be an independent prognostic factor for patients＊ survival. In addition, immunofluorescent assay demonstrated that CAP1 was colocalized with actin in the leading edge of lamellipodium in HCC cells. Importantly, knocking-down the expression of CAP1 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting CAP1 led to impaired migration of HCC cells. Collectively, our results indicated that upregulated expression of CAP1 might contribute heavily to the metastasis of HCC."

Chaudhary, ","Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 334, Issue 2, 21 November 2003, Pages 241-254, ","We designed a bacteriophage lambda system to display peptides and proteins fused at the C terminus of the head protein gpD of phage lambda. DNA encoding the foreign peptide/protein was first inserted at the 3∩ end of a DNA segment encoding gpD under the control of the lac promoter in a plasmid vector (donor plasmid), which also carried lox Pwt and lox P511 recombination sequences. Cre-expressing cells were transformed with this plasmid and subsequently infected with a recipient lambda phage that carried a stuffer DNA segment flanked by lox Pwt and lox P511 sites. Recombination occurred in vivo at the lox sites and Ampr cointegrates were formed. The cointegrates produced recombinant phage that displayed foreign protein fused at the C terminus of gpD. The system was optimised by cloning DNA encoding different length fragments of HIV-1 p24 (amino acid residues 1每72, 1每156 and 1每231) and the display was compared with that obtained with M13 phage. The display on lambda phage was at least 100-fold higher than on M13 phage for all the fragments with no degradation of displayed products. The high-density display on lambda phage was superior to that on M13 phage and resulted in selective enrichment of epitope-bearing clones from gene-fragment libraries. Single-chain antibodies were displayed in functional form on phage lambda, strongly suggesting that correct disulphide bond formation takes place during display.This lambda phage display system, which avoids direct cloning into lambda DNA and in vitro packaging, achieved cloning efficiencies comparable to those obtained with any plasmid system. The high-density display of foreign proteins on bacteriophage lambda should be extremely useful in studying low-affinity protein每protein interactions more efficiently compared to the M13 phage-based system."
Prevalence of skin disease in a cohort of shelter-based homeless men,"Alexander J. Stratigos, Robert Stern, Ernesto Gonz芍lez, Richard Allen Johnson, Jeffrey S. Dover, ","Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, Volume 41, Issue 2, August 1999, Pages 197-202, ","Background: Cutaneous disease is a frequent cause of morbidity in homeless people. A variety of infectious and noninfectious conditions have been described in this population that are exacerbated by malnutrition, exposure to hazardous environment, psychiatric disease, physical injuries, and limited access to health care. Objective: Our purpose was to study the prevalence of skin disease in a selected group of the homeless population. Methods: We evaluated skin diseases in a cohort of 142 homeless men who were staying overnight in a major Boston homeless shelter for men over a period of 3 months (March-June 1992). The subjects participated in the study by volunteering for a free skin examination. Completion of a detailed questionnaire on age, race, duration of homelessness, and general medical status was followed by a thorough skin examination performed by dermatologists. Results: The most prevalent skin diseases in the examined population were tinea pedis (38%), pitted keratolysis of the feet (20.4%), traumatic injuries (19.7%), toenail onychomycosis (15.4%), acne vulgaris (18.3%), and seborrheic dermatitis (13.3%). Conclusion: To our surprise the majority of patients had relatively normal findings from skin examinations with only a few pathologic findings, most often related to poor foot hygiene and long-term exposure to moisture. We attribute the relatively good condition of our cohort to the excellent care provided by the shelter with regard to clothing, cleaning facilities, and medical care.

An Enhanced and Scalable Process for the Purification of SIV Gag-Specific MHC Tetramer,"Karen M. Grimm, Wendy L. Trigona, Gwendolyn J. Heidecker, Joseph G. Joyce, James C. Cook, ","Protein Expression and Purification, Volume 23, Issue 2, November 2001, Pages 270-281, ","A recently developed method for the identification and quantitation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes involves the use of complexes of biotinylated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and avidin conjugated to a fluorescent reporter group. This complex, dubbed the ※tetramer,§ binds to antigen-specific T lymphocytes in vitro, which can then be sorted and counted by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry to measure immune response. Our research has focused on developing the purification process for preparing tetramer reagent. Our goal was to reengineer a published lab-scale purification process to reduce the number of processing steps and to make the process scalable. In our reengineered process, recombinant MHC 汐 chain is isolated from Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies by tangential flow filtration. The purified MHC 汐 chain is refolded with 汕-2-microglobulin and the target peptide antigen to form the class I MHC. The resulting MHC is purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and biotinylated enzymatically, and the biotinylated MHC is purified by a second HIC step. The tetramer is prepared by mixing biotinylated MHC with an avidin-fluorophore conjugate. The tetramer is further purified to remove any excess MHC or avidin components. Analysis by flow cytometry confirmed that the tetramers generated by this new process gave bright staining and specific binding to CD3+/CD8+ cells of vaccinated monkeys and led to results that were equivalent to those generated with tetramer produced by the original process."

The analysis was conducted using gas chromatography每mass spectrometry (GC每MS). The sediments used to restore the marsh were taken from the Calcasieu River ship channel. Large quantities of refined and crude petroleum hydrocarbons are transported along the ship channel, which has long been suspected to be highly contaminated. No PAHs were detected in any samples above lower levels of detection. However, hexachlorobenzene and hexachlorobutadiene were detected at levels just below the practical quantitation limit. Based on these results, use of Calcasieu River Ship Channel dredge spoils to restore Sabine National Wildlife Refuge marsh sediments should not lead to ecological problems."
Manipulating the electronic and chemical properties of graphene via molecular functionalization,"Hong Ying Mao, Yun Hao Lu, Jia Dan Lin, Shu Zhong, Wei Chen, ","Progress in Surface Science, Volume 88, Issue 2, May 2013, Pages 132-159, ","Graphene, a single atomic layer of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal structure and the Nobel winning material in 2010, has attracted extensive research attention in the last few years due to its outstanding physical, chemical, electrical, optical and mechanical properties. To further extend its potential applications, intensive research efforts have been devoted to the functionalization of graphene. Examples include improving graphene solubility by attaching different chemical functional groups to its basal plane, modulating the charge carrier type and concentration via surface transfer doping by coating it with various metals films or organic molecules, improving the bio-selectivity by decorating it with different 羽-conjugated organic molecules, and so on. Different methods have been developed to functionalize graphene. Among them, non-covalent molecular functionalization represents one of the most effective and promising methods. The extended 羽-conjugation is largely preserved without creating extensive structural defects on the graphene sheet, thereby retaining the high charge carrier mobility. In this review, a brief summary about different functionalization methods of graphene and its derivatives by covalent and non-covalent interactions will be presented, with particular focus on the non-covalent molecular functionalization. A broad review of the applications of non-covalently functionalized graphene and its derivatives will be presented in detail, including field-effect-transistors, organic optoelectronics, and molecular sensing."

Unlike the primary cell walls, which are initiated during cell division and develop along with the expansion of the cells, secondary cell walls are constructed after the cells have stopped growing. Hence, the transition from primary to secondary wall synthesis marks an important and distinct metabolic investment by the plant. This transition requires a coordinated change of a plethora of cellular processes, including hormonal, transcriptional and post-transcriptional activities, metabolic flux re-distributions and enzymatic activities. In this review, we briefly summarize the hormonal and transcriptional control of the primary to secondary wall transition, and highlight important gaps in our understanding of the metabolic framework that support the transition. Several tools that may aid in future research efforts to better understand the changes in cell wall synthesis during the trans-differentiation are also discussed."
Enhanced switching law for synchronized switch damping on inductor with bimodal excitation,"Marcus Neubauer, Xu Han, Sebastian M. Schwarzendahl, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, Volume 330, Issue 12, 6 June 2011, Pages 2707-2720, ","Piezoelectric shunt damping is an emerging field of research. In recent years, a multitude of different electrical circuits have been developed aiming to increase the damping performance and robustness. Synchronized switch damping on inductor (SSDI) is a semi-active control technique that utilizes a passive inductance to build-up a voltage on the piezoceramics that is synchronized with the mechanical vibration. For a single mode excitation the voltage inversion should occur at the moments of maximum deformation, but for multimodal vibrations such a switching law may not be optimal.In this paper a novel switching law for bimodal vibrations is presented using a modal observer. An enhanced voltage build-up is generated by utilizing the vibration energy of the second mode. The amplification of dissipated energy is calculated in an analytical way using normalized parameters, yielding a general result which includes the influence of the frequency and amplitude ratio of the excitation signal. Measurements on a clamped beam test rig are conducted in order to validate the proposed method. An increase of nearly 350 percent in energy dissipation compared to the classical SSDI has been achieved. Furthermore, the increase in energy dissipation is higher than for a previously suggested, comparable switching law."

The optimal configurations of multi-cell tubes were analyzed under axial and more than one oblique impact loadings.

"Sterane distribution of solid bitumen pyrolyzates. Changes with biodegradation of crude oil in the Ouachita Mountains, Oklahoma","Joseph A Curiale, William E. Harrison, Garmon Smith, ","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, Volume 47, Issue 3, March 1983, Pages 517-523, ","Solid bitumens (grahamite and impsonite) of southeastern Oklahoma have been shown to originate from near-surface alteration of crude oil (Curiale, 1981; Curiale and Harrison, 1981). Pyrolysis of these solids has been employed to compare the sterane distribution of geographically proximate oils to that of the bitumens. The ratio of rearranged to regular steranes is higher in the pyrolyzates than in the oils, a finding consistent with a bitumen origin due to biodegradation of oil. The remaining presence of steranes, particularly regular steranes, in the bitumens suggests that sterane occlusion may have occurred prior to or during the alteration process, thus removing tetracyclic compounds from the influence of microbial attack. These data suggest that pyrolysis-GCMS offers a viable approach to correlation problems involving solid bitumens."

Data gathering problem with the data importance consideration in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks,"Chien-Fu Cheng, Lung-Hao Li, ","Journal of Network and Computer Applications, Volume 78, 15 January 2017, Pages 300-312, ","In Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs), if sensors rely on multi-hop transmission to send sensing data to the sink above the water, sensors that are closer to the water's surface will deplete energy sooner because they share a larger load of the packet relaying work. This problem becomes worse if the water being monitored is very deep. This imbalance in energy consumption can be effectively mitigated by using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to collect data. However, if the data to collect are important, the delay time required by this data gathering method may be too long. In this study, we integrate the two data gathering mechanisms mentioned above, namely utilization of AUVs and multi-hop transmission, to reduce the problem of unbalanced energy consumption and long delay time. Moreover, we also investigate how to determine the importance level of data and set delay time requirements without domain knowledge. Our purpose is to deliver data of higher importance to the sink within the delay time requirement. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the imbalance in energy consumption, reduce the delay time required for delivering important data, and also prolong the network lifetime."

This study investigates the nature of the endometrial cell populations targeted by epithelial GM-CSF. In quantitative RT-PCR studies, expression of the 汐-subunit of the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSF-R) parallelled GM-CSF expression, being maximal during the 48 h period after mating and declining thereafter. Expression of mRNA encoding 汕-common chain (AIC2B) also increased after mating and remained high until the time of embryo implantation on day 4 of pregnancy. Cells expressing GM-CSF receptors were identified in sections of uterus on the day after mating using 125I-GM-CSF, and were located predominantly in the endometrial stroma subjacent to the luminal epithelium, co-localising with abundant populations of myeloid leukocytes. Cells expressing GM-CSF receptor were identified as macrophages, granulocytes and putative dendritic cells by flow cytometric analysis using lineage and receptor subunit specific antibodies. Recombinant GM-CSF injected into the uterine lumen of ovariectomised mice was found to elicit a dose-dependant accumulation of macrophages and granulocytes in the endometrium, in a pattern of distribution comparable to that seen in uteri after natural mating. Together, these data indicate a role for epithelial cell-derived GM-CSF in mediating the recruitment and potentially in modifying the behaviour of uterine leukocytes during the post-mating inflammatory response in mice."

The coatings were post-treated by vacuum heat treatment at 600 and 900 ∼C, and laser re-melting with 300 W, respectively, to study the influence of different treatments on the structure and properties of the coatings. The phase constitution, microstructure and microhardness of the coatings after treatments were investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry. Results showed that the as-sprayed coatings consisted of pure metal and Fe-Cr. The AlNi3 phase was obtained after the vacuum heat treatment process. A body-centered cubic structure with less AlNi3 could be found in the coating after the laser re-melting process. The average hardness values of the as-sprayed coating and the coatings with two different temperature vacuum heat treatments and with laser re-melting were 177, 227, 266 and 682 HV, respectively. This suggests that the vacuum heat treatment promoted the alloying process of the coatings, and contributed to the enhancement of the coating wear resistance. The laser re-melted coating showed the best wear resistance."

Photoadaptation of carboxylating enzymes and photosynthesis during a spring bloom,"John Clegg Smith, Trevor Platt, William G Harrison, ","Progress in Oceanography, Volume 12, Issue 4, 1983, Pages 425-459, ","Properties of the light saturation curve of photosynthesis and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPC) activity are shown to change qualitatively in a natural population of marine phytoplankton during a spring bloom. Evidence is presented to show that these changes constitute photoadapative responses to increasing irradiance. As irradiance increased during the bloom, both the level of light-saturated photosynthesis (Pm) and the initial slope of the light saturation curve (汐 = photosynthetic efficiency) increased whether those parameters were normalized to chlorophyll a concentration (Pmb, 汐b) or to cell numbers (Pmc, 汐c). The magnitudes of these changes were such that Ik (= Pm/汐, the photoadaptation parameter) did not change, but Im, the light intensity at which photosynthesis becomes saturated, increased. RuBPC activity, both chlorophyll a (RuBPCb) and cell number normalized (RuBPCc), also increased during the bloom. We suggest that these adaptations were achieved by simultaneously increasing the number of photosynthetic units, proportionately decreasing the photosynthetic unit size, and increasing both the concentrations of the enzymes of the dark reactions and possibly also of photosynthetic electron transport components.We also observed diminished levels of photoinhibition in the high light adapted cells late in the bloom and have suggested that this was a consequence of the same suite of physiological changes.In situ carbon fixation per cell increased during the bloom whereas no change occurred in this parameter when normalized to chlorophyll a concentration. Although these photoadaptive responses thus permitted carbon to be fixed in situ more rapidly per cell, at a constant efficiency with respect to investment of energy in the photosynthetic apparatus, they did not result in a change in growth rate. Based on consideratios of the role of time scale in physiological adaptation, however, it is suggested that the observed alterations in photosynthesis with increasing irradiance might permit a cell to more rapidly fill an energy quota for division, possibly an advantage in a mixing environment in which energy is patchily distributed, both spatially and temporalyy.Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity when normalized to chlorophyll a (PEPCb) did not change during the bloom while chlorophyll a normalized dark carbon fixation decreased sharply and was quantitatively small compared to PEPCb. On this basis and considering that RuBPCb increased during the bloom, it is suggested that, although PEPC may be involved in dark carbon fixation, its most important quantitative role is probably an indirect one in light dependent photosynthesis.We have also considered the relevance of laboratory results on photoadaptation to interpretations of field studies and have suggested that batch culture studies must be treated with caution but that turbidistat and semi-continuous methods provide reasonable simulations of natural conditions."
pH-dependent KOW provides new insights in understanding the adsorption mechanism of ionizable organic chemicals on carbonaceous materials,"Hao Li, Yanbei Cao, Di Zhang, Bo Pan, ","Science of The Total Environment, Volume 618, 15 March 2018, Pages 269-275, ","The dominant adsorption mechanism of ionizable organic chemicals (IOCs) on carbonaceous materials is still unclear. This study used benzoic acid (BA), o-chlorobenzoic acid (2-CBA) and p-chlorobenzoic acid (4-CBA) as representatives of IOCs to investigate the dominant adsorption mechanism on graphene oxide (GO) and graphite (GP), with a specific emphasis on the impact of pH-dependent KOW. The order of apparent adsorption of the investigated chemicals changed with pH, which could not be explained by their constant KOW. According to our measurement, KOW varied greatly with pH. The pH-dependent adsorption of BA, 2-CBA and 4-CBA were significantly correlated with pH-dependent KOW for both GO and GP. Our observations indicated that the hydrophobic effects may dominate the apparent adsorption of BA, 2-CBA and 4-CBA on GO and GP. Electrostatic repulsion played a minor role in their reduced adsorption at high pH. Negative charge-assisted H-bond and 羽-羽 interactions may explain the adsorption of negatively charged BA, 2-CBA and 4-CBA on negatively charged GO. This study implied that pH-dependent KOW rather than constant KOW should be incorporated to understand IOC adsorption as affected by pH.Download high-res image (207KB)Download full-size image"

An efficient immune-based symbiotic particle swarm optimization learning algorithm for TSK-type neuro-fuzzy networks design,"Cheng-Jian Lin, ","Fuzzy Sets and Systems, Volume 159, Issue 21, 1 November 2008, Pages 2890-2909, ","In this paper, we propose a new learning algorithm that can be used to design TSK-type neuro-fuzzy networks. Though there has been a great deal of interest in the use of immune algorithms (IAs) for computer science and engineering, in terms of fundamental methodologies, they are not dramatically different from other algorithms. In order to enhance the IA performance, we propose the immune-based symbiotic particle swarm optimization (ISPSO) for use in TSK-type neuro-fuzzy networks for solving the prediction and skin color detection problems. The proposed ISPSO embeds the symbiotic evolution scheme in an IA and utilizes particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve the mutation mechanism. In order to avoid trapping in a local optimal solution and to ensure the search capability of a near global optimal solution, mutation plays an important role. Therefore, we employed the advantages of PSO to improve the mutation mechanism and used a method that introduces chaotic mapping with certainty, ergodicity and the stochastic property into PSO to improve global convergence. Unlike the IA that uses each individual in a population as a full solution to a problem, symbiotic evolution assumes that each individual in a population represents only a partial solution to a problem. Complex solutions combine several individuals in the population."

A semi-empirical correlation between the permselectivity to H2/N2 and the permselectivity to O2/N2 for a given membrane was developed on the basis of the phenomenological resistance model, taking into account the Knudsen diffusion through the defects that were not ＆repaired＊ by the surface coating. This correlation can be used to predict the membrane performance for H2/N2 separation from the O2/N2 separation data, which can be obtained more economically from an air separation test. The validity of the correlation was justified with experimental data. Since H2 is not required in evaluating the membrane performance for H2/N2 separation, this provides an economical tool for membrane evaluation and quality assurance in the development and manufacturing of industrial hydrogen separation membranes. Although the present work focuses on poly(dimethyl siloxane)/polysulfone composite membranes, the same approach can be applied to the other so-called ＆resistance model＊ type of membranes."
Chapter Two: Metabolomics of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Alejandro Botas, Hannah Moore Campbell, Xu Han, Mirjana Maletic-Savatic, ","International Review of Neurobiology, Volume 122, 2015, Pages 53-80, ","Neurodegenerative diseases are progressive, devastating, and terminal, carrying both personal and societal burden. Currently, their diagnosis depends on their clinical presentation. No quantitative biomarkers exist to enable early verdict and commencement of therapy. The lack of diagnostic biomarkers stems from the unavailability of brain tissue, the complexity and heterogeneity of the brain and neurodegenerative pathology, and the fact that peripheral tissues such as blood, urine, and even cerebrospinal fluid might not reflect early stages of brain pathology. Moreover, accumulated evidence indicates the majority of these diseases are not genetically inherited; rather, the genes bring about the risk to develop them, but the trigger is not known. As metabolites are at the intersection between the genetic background of a cell or a tissue and the environmental effects on the same, metabolomics has emerged as a field with great promise to deliver new, biologically, and clinically relevant biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders.

Other variables associated with cardiac death (p ≒ 0.05) were age >65 years, nitrate therapy, ventricular ectopy during DSE, suspected angina pectoris, and hospitalization at the time of DSE. When cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization procedures were all considered as adverse outcomes, a new wall motion abnormality continued to be the most powerful predictor of an adverse cardiac event. We conclude that DSE provides greater prognostic information than that available from clinical data in a population known or suspected to have coronary artery disease and unable to exercise."
A ZMP based interval criterion for rollover-risk diagnosis,"Xu HAN, Joanny STEPHANT, Gilles MOURIOUX, Dominique MEIZEL, ","IFAC-PapersOnLine, Volume 48, Issue 21, 2015, Pages 277-282, ","This paper presents an interval criterion used to anticipate rollover accidents of all-terrain wheeled vehicles. The Zero Moment Point concept, initially designed for humanoid robots, is presented in the case of a 4 wheels vehicle, first in an ideal case of a perfectly flat ground and finally in the off-road context. This adaptation is done by assuming that the tyre/ground contact is no more punctual but distributed in a set enclosed in a computable box (3D interval). It is then possible to derive an interval version of the ideal ZMP-based criterion. The method is experimented by using data collected during a real experiment done with a vineyard harvester that is a typical case of wheeled reconfigurable vehicle. The interval criterion gives a flexibility for its interpretation that is more adapted to the complex and varying all-terrain context."

Anesthesia-inducing drugs also induce conditioned taste aversions,"Jian-You Lin, Joe Arthurs, Steve Reilly, ","Physiology & Behavior, Volume 177, 1 August 2017, Pages 247-251, ","Animals learn to reduce their intake of a tastant when its ingestion is followed by the administration of an anesthesia-inducing drug. To determine the nature of this intake suppression, the current study examined whether ketamine/xylazine (Experiment 1) and pentobarbital (Experiment 2) also conditionally reduce taste palatability. Using lick pattern analysis, we found that pairing saccharin with either drug reduced total licks, lick cluster size, and initial lick rate. Given that both lick cluster size and initial lick rate are indices of palatability, this pattern of results indicates that anesthesia-inducing drugs also induce conditioned taste aversions."

Multi-objective building energy consumption prediction and optimization for eco-community planning,"Xu Han, Jingjing Pei, Junjie Liu, Luyi Xu, ","Energy and Buildings, Volume 66, November 2013, Pages 22-32, ","The planning of an eco-city/community involves multiple factors, including building energy consumption, carbon emission, initial cost, as well as local natural, geographical and socio-economic conditions. To assist policymakers and planners to make the optimum decisions, especially in the early planning stage of an eco-city/community, this paper developed a quick and convenient multi-objective prediction and optimization tool. Building energy consumption, carbon emission and initial cost were considered as three sub-objectives. The optimization parameters include those for building envelope (i.e. heat transfer coefficient, window shading coefficient, unit cost) and those for air-conditioning system (i.e. coefficient of performance) for each type of buildings. The building energy consumption was calculated based on the BIN method. The carbon emission was determined with the energy consumption and carbon emission factor of each energy type. The initial incremental cost was calculated with the material and product price. Priority consideration of the three sub-objectives was achieved by weight factor method during the optimization process. The weight factors could be determined empirically by policymakers, investors, or planners. The optimization results can be referred by decision makers. Finally, an eco-community in Chongqing, China was taken for a case study, and parameter sensitive analysis was conducted."

The initial retroperitoneal space was created by insertion of a rubber catheter attached to a saline-filled midfinger of a glove. The renal hilum and ureter were circumferentially mobilized. The tributaries of renal vessels were divided by harmonic scalpel without any clips. In laparoscopy, the ureter was sheared with scissors. A longitudinal 6-8 cm skin incision was enlarged form the primary trocar distally to retrieve the graft. The main renal vessels were controlled, using 2 Hem-o-lok clips placed at each proximal ends. The graft was retrieved manually through the skin incision.All the 109 RPLLDNs were carried out successfully.

Overall physical disability was evaluated by the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and individual symptoms were rated according to the Kurtzke Functional Systems (FS) scale. Our results suggest that MRI brain abnormalities are significantly related to the overall severity of disease, but MRI is not particularly useful to predict the presence or absence of individual symptoms. These findings do suggest that the MRI may provide useful information to monitor clinical progression of patients with MS, but the lesions visualized need not always be symptomatic nor are we sure that all symptomatic lesions, particularly in the spinal cord and optic nerves, will be visualized."

O＊Connell, Robert H. Wood, Everett L. Shock, ","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, Volume 64, Issue 16, August 2000, Pages 2779-2795, ","The volumetric equation proposed previously (Plyasunov et al., 2000), for estimating the infinite dilution Gibbs energy of hydration of volatile nonelectrolytes at temperatures exceeding the critical temperature of pure water, Tc, is extended to subcritical temperatures. The basis for the extension without inclusion of new fitting parameters besides the experimental values of the thermodynamic functions of hydration at 298.15 K, 0.1 MPa, is an auxiliary function, 忖hCp0(T, Pr), for the variation of the infinite dilution partial molar heat capacity of hydration of a solute in liquid-like water between temperatures T = 273.15 K and T = Ts = 658 K along the isobar Pr = 28 MPa. The analytical form of 忖hCp0(T, Pr) was found by globally fitting all available data for the seven best-studied solutes (CH4, CO2, H2S, NH3, Ar, Xe, and C2H4). Four constraints were used to determine the values of four terms of the 忖hCp0(T, Pr) function: the numerical values of the temperature increments between T = 298.15 K and T = Ts = 658 K for the Gibbs energy and the enthalpy of hydration, and numerical value of the heat capacity at Ts and at 298.15 K, all at the selected isobar Pr. This approach, in combination with the volumetric equation, may be used to describe and predict all the infinite dilution thermodynamic functions of hydration for nonelectrolytes over extremely wide ranges of temperature and pressure. The model allows calculation of the standard state partial molar properties, including the Gibbs energy of aqueous solutes in a single framework for conditions from high-temperature magmatic processes through hydrothermal phenomena to low-temperature conditions of hypergenesis."

This study was conducted to assess the seroprevalence of HAV and HEV and its associated factors with an aim to provide inputs to planners regarding requirement of HAV vaccine.A multi-centric cross sectional survey amongst 4175 healthy trainees (young adults) was carried out in training centres, selected by multistage random sampling, giving equal representation to all regions of India. Sample size was calculated by taking prevalence of HAV seropositivity amongst adults as 60% and alpha 0.05.Seroprevalence for HAV and HEV was 92.68% (95% CI 91.82, 93.47) and 17.05% (15.90, 18.26), respectively. Logistic regression showed that hand washing without soap, regular close contact with domestic animals, consumption of unpasteurized milk and regular consumption of food outside home were risk factors for HAV (p < 0.05). For HEV, irregular hand washing, consumption of unpasteurized milk and irregular consumption of freshly prepared food were risk factors (p < 0.05).High level of immunity against HAV among the healthy young adults clearly demonstrates that vaccination against HAV is not required at present in our country. The large proportion being susceptible to HEV points towards the requirement of preventive strategies in the form of safe drinking water supply, hygiene, sanitation, increasing awareness and behaviour change with respect to personal hygiene especially hand and food hygiene."

Retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy was performed first and followed by cystoscopic excision of ipsilateral ureteral orifice with bladder cuff. A 6-cm midline lower abdominal incision was made. The distal ureter was dissected transperitoneally into the intramural segment, and the intact specimen was removed manually via the same incision. The cystostomy was generally not sutured.The mean operation time was 264 minutes. The mean estimated blood loss was 256 mL. Three patients needed blood transfusion. No open conversion was required. Two patients experienced minor complications. Pathologic findings confirmed UUT-TCC in all patients with 8 of the pelvis and 7 of the ureter. Four were involved with bladder TCC. With the mean follow-up of 30 months, none of the patients developed retroperitoneal recurrence or distant metastasis, 2 of the 4 patients with bladder TCC had recurrence in the bladder, and 2 had contralateral UUT-TCC after the first unilateral nephroureterectomy.RPLNU with bladder cuff excision by combining cystoscopic resection with open transperitoneal dissection might be a safe and feasible alternative for native UUT-TCC ipsilateral to a transplanted kidney with acceptable oncological outcomes."

The P3 technique, using equal-order approximation, is implemented in the cell-based S-FEM (CS), edge-based S-FEM (ES) and node-based S-FEM (NS) all using simplest triangular element. The proposed P3-S-FEMs (P3-CS, P3-ES, P3-NS) are supposed to address issues of volumetric locking and pressure oscillation using equal-order displacement-pressure approximations. Numerical examples are employed to verify and check performances of the proposed methods, demonstrating that all the P3-S-FEMs are fully volumetric locking free. Except for P3-NS, P3-CS and P3-ES are without pressure oscillation. Another founding of P3-S-FEMs is that P3 technique can further soft the whole system besides S-FEMs. The excellent properties of these S-FEMs for compressible materials are still maintained by P3-S-FEMs, such as the insensitiveness to mesh distortion. The unique upper bound property of NS-FEM is also inherited by P3-NS. In the performance studies, P3-ES stands out on accuracy, convergence and efficiency among three proposed methods."

Adults lacking dADAR are morphologically wild-type but exhibit extreme behavioral deficits including temperature-sensitive paralysis, locomotor uncoordination, and tremors which increase in severity with age. Neurodegeneration accompanies the increase in phenotypic severity. Surprisingly, dADAR mutants are not short-lived. Thus, A-to-I editing of pre-mRNAs in Drosophila acts predominantly through nervous system targets to affect adult nervous system function, integrity, and behavior."

Protective effect of dioscin against thioacetamide-induced acute liver injury via FXR/AMPK signaling pathway in vivo,"Lingli Zheng, Lianhong Yin, Lina Xu, Yan Qi, Jinyong Peng, ","Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, Volume 97, January 2018, Pages 481-488, ","Our previous works showed that dioscin, a natural product, could protect liver from acute liver damages induced by dimethylnitrosamine, ethanol, carbon tetrachloride and acetaminophen. However, the effect of dioscin on thioacetamide (TAA)-induced acute liver injury still remained unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether dioscin confers a protective effect against TAA-induced acute liver injury in rats and mice. The results showed that dioscin decreased the serum levels of ALT, AST, and rehabilitated histopathological changes compared with the model groups. In addition, dioscin obviously increased the levels of GSH, GSH-Px, SOD, and significantly reduced MDA levels compared with the model groups. Mechanistic study showed that dioscin significantly up-regulated the expression levels of FXR, p-AMPK汐, and then increased the expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO-1, GCLM and GST. Furthermore, dioscin obviously down-regulated the expression levels of NF-百B (p65), ICAM-1, HMGB1, COX-2, TNF-汐, IL-1汕 and IL-6. Taken together, dioscin showed protective effect against TAA-induced acute liver injuries in rats and mice and the effects might be obtained through inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation via FXR/AMPK signal pathway.

Topology optimization for concurrent design of structures with multi-patch microstructures by level sets,"Hao Li, Zhen Luo, Liang Gao, Qinghua Qin, ","Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Volume 331, 1 April 2018, Pages 536-561, ","This paper focuses on the novel concurrent design for cellular structures consisting of multiple patches of material microstructures using a level set-based topological shape optimization method. The macro structure is featured with the configuration of a cluster of non-uniformly distributed patches, while each patch hosts a number of identical material microstructures. At macro scale, a discrete element density based approach is presented to generate an overall structural layout involving different groups of discrete element densities. At micro scale, each macro element is regarded as an individual microstructure with a discrete intermediate density. Hence, all the macro elements with the same discrete densities (volume fractions) are represented by a unique microstructure. The representative microstructures corresponding to different density groups are topologically optimized by incorporating the numerical homogenization approach into a parametric level set method. The multiscale concurrent designs are integrated into a uniform optimization procedure, so as to optimize both topologies for the macrostructure and its microstructures, as well as locations of the microstructures in the design space. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially improve the structural performance with an affordable computation and manufacturing cost."
An optimal mutation execution strategy for cost reduction of mutation-based fault localization,"Yong Liu, Zheng Li, Ruilian Zhao, Pei Gong, ","Information Sciences, Volume 422, January 2018, Pages 572-596, ","Identifying faulty program entities has been recognized as one of the most expensive, tedious and time-consuming processes in software debugging activity. Fault localization techniques are designed to assist developers in locating faults by giving a ranking of the probability that program entities incur failures. Mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) is a recently proposed fault localization approach via mutation analysis, which uses the location of mutants to identify the faulty statements. With improved effectiveness, the MBFL also brings huge execution cost. To reduce the execution cost of MBFL technique, this paper proposes a dynamic mutation execution strategy (DMES) to prioritize the execution on both mutants and test cases. As fewer mutants and test cases are executed with DMES, the whole process will become faster and the cost will be decreased. At the same time, it is proved that the fault localization accuracy of MBFL with DMES is the same as that of the original MBFL. Furthermore, this paper discusses the lowest mutation execution cost of MBFL in theory and gives a quick solution to compute the theoretical minimal mutation execution cost of MBFL in the case of keeping fault localization accuracy non-decreasing. The empirical studies show that MBFL with the dynamic strategy proposed in this paper can reduce mutant-test execution cost by 32.4每87% and is close to the theoretical optimal cost. Furthermore, the additional run time required by utilizing our strategy is minimum and can be ignored."
Brain extraction from normal and pathological images: A joint PCA/Image-Reconstruction approach,"Xu Han, Roland Kwitt, Stephen Aylward, Spyridon Bakas, Marc Niethammer, ","NeuroImage, Volume 176, 1 August 2018, Pages 431-445, ","Brain extraction from 3D medical images is a common pre-processing step. A variety of approaches exist, but they are frequently only designed to perform brain extraction from images without strong pathologies. Extracting the brain from images exhibiting strong pathologies, for example, the presence of a brain tumor or of a traumatic brain injury (TBI), is challenging. In such cases, tissue appearance may substantially deviate from normal tissue appearance and hence violates algorithmic assumptions for standard approaches to brain extraction; consequently, the brain may not be correctly extracted.This paper proposes a brain extraction approach which can explicitly account for pathologies by jointly modeling normal tissue appearance and pathologies. Specifically, our model uses a three-part image decomposition: (1) normal tissue appearance is captured by principal component analysis (PCA), (2) pathologies are captured via a total variation term, and (3) the skull and surrounding tissue is captured by a sparsity term. Due to its convexity, the resulting decomposition model allows for efficient optimization. Decomposition and image registration steps are alternated to allow statistical modeling of normal tissue appearance in a fixed atlas coordinate system. As a beneficial side effect, the decomposition model allows for the identification of potentially pathological areas and the reconstruction of a quasi-normal image in atlas space.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four datasets: the publicly available IBSR and LPBA40 datasets which show normal image appearance, the BRATS dataset containing images with brain tumors, and a dataset containing clinical TBI images. We compare the performance with other popular brain extraction models: ROBEX, BEaST, MASS, BET, BSE and a recently proposed deep learning approach. Our model performs better than these competing approaches on all four datasets. Specifically, our model achieves the best median (97.11) and mean (96.88) Dice scores over all datasets. The two best performing competitors, ROBEX and MASS, achieve scores of 96.23/95.62 and 96.67/94.25 respectively. Hence, our approach is an effective method for high quality brain extraction for a wide variety of images."

An online learning algorithm, structure learning and parameter learning, allows the dynamic determining of the number of wavelet bases, and adjusting the shape of the wavelet bases and the connection weights. The SCWN controller is a highly autonomous system. Initially, there are no hidden nodes. They are created and begin to grow as learning proceeds. Computer simulations have been conducted to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed learning scheme."
Serum plasminogen as a potential biomarker for the effects of low-dose benzene exposure,"Boxuan Liang, Yizhou Zhong, Kengkeng Chen, Lihai Zeng, Zhenlie Huang, ","Toxicology, Volume 410, 1 December 2018, Pages 59-64, ","Exposure to low-dose benzene may lead to hematotoxicity and cause health problems. Though peripheral blood cell count is widely used in benzene exposure assessment and health risk assessment, the reports regarding the effects of low-dose benzene exposure on blood cell count remain inconsistent. To uncover more sensitive biomarkers for low-dose benzene exposure, our previous study screened out three potential serum proteins〞plasminogen (PLG), platelet basic protein (PBP) and apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100)〞as biomarkers from chronic benzene poisoning patients by using proteomic analysis. In the present study, we verify the three serum proteins as biomarkers for the effects of low-dose benzene exposure in a large low-dose benzene exposure population. The study showed that serum PLG increased in benzene exposed workers and was positively correlated with benzene exposure levels. However, no significant changes in serum PBP or ApoB100 were found in the benzene exposed workers. To explore whether the candidate serum proteins are associated with hematotoxicity, the study population was regrouped into two groups, based on their WBC counts. Our results showed that the workers with high serum PLG levels suffered higher risk of WBC abnormalities than did workers with low serum PLG levels. Taken together, these findings indicate that the increase in serum PLG might be associated with low-dose benzene exposure and benzene每induced hematotoxicity. Thus, we suggest serum PLG could be used as a potential biomarker for the effects of low-dose benzene exposure."
Metastasis to the Eye and Orbit from Renal Cell Carcinoma〞A Report of Three Cases and Review of Literature,"Debraj Shome, Santosh G. Honavar, Pankaj Gupta, Geeta K. Vemuganti, P. Vijay Anand Reddy, ","Survey of Ophthalmology, Volume 52, Issue 2, March每April 2007, Pages 213-223, ","We report three cases of renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the eye and orbit and review the relevant literature. The case reports of a 67-year-old man, a 58-year-old man, and a 23-year-old woman with metastatic renal cell carcinoma are described. The iris mass occurred in a 67-year-old man, a known case of renal cell carcinoma. Whereas the orbital metastasis in the 58-year-old man was the initial presenting sign in a hitherto undiagnosed patient, the orbital metastasis in the 23-year-old female patient was detected following nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. Renal cell carcinoma metastasizing to the eye and orbit are very rare, with only 68 cases reported previously. In patients presenting with atypical orbital or ocular masses, the possibility of renal cell carcinoma metastasis should be considered, especially if there is a history of previous renal disorder. Incisional biopsy with histopathological evaluation may be an important means to diagnose this condition and facilitate appropriate therapy."

Mechanical properties and toughening mechanism of TiB2/NiTi reinforced titanium matrix composite coating by laser cladding,"Yinghua Lin, Yongping Lei, Hanguang Fu, Jian Lin, ","Materials & Design, Volume 80, 5 September 2015, Pages 82-88, ","Coarse TiB2, fine TiB and NiTi/NiTi2 reinforced titanium matrix composite coatings with part of the network-like structure reinforcement distribution were prepared by laser cladding on Ti每6Al每4V alloy using premixed Ni, coarse TiB2, fine TiB2 and Ti powder. The amount and the size of coarse TiB2 were decreased with increasing distance from the surface. The network-like structure was mainly consisted of NiTi and Ni3Ti, and the characteristic of network-like structure gradually became clearer from the top to the bottom. The micro-hardness of the coating was first decreased abruptly and then decreased gradually with increasing distance from the surface, but fracture toughness of the coating was first decreased and then increased. The fracture toughness of the coating can be improved through the crack deflection and the bifurcation, but the crack deflection and the bifurcation were random.Download full-size image"

Computational modelling for the embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations,"Piotr Orlowski, Paul Summers, J. Alison Noble, James Byrne, Yiannis Ventikos, ","Medical Engineering & Physics, Volume 34, Issue 7, September 2012, Pages 873-881, ",Treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain often requires the injection of a liquid embolic material to reduce blood flow through the malformation. The type of the liquid and the location of injection have to be carefully planned in a pre-operative manner. We introduce a new model of the interaction of liquid embolic materials with blood for the simulation of their propagation and solidification in the AVM. Solidification is mimicked by an increase of the material's viscosity. Propagation is modelled by using the concept of two-fluids modelling and that of scalar transport. The method is tested on digital phantoms and on one anatomically derived patient AVM case. Simulations showed that intuitive behaviour of the two-fluid system can be confirmed and that two types of glue propagation through the malformation can be reproduced. Distinction between the two types of propagation could be used to identify fistulous and plexiform compartments composing the AVM and to characterize the solidification of the embolic material in them.

Using traits of web macro scripts to predict reuse,"Chris Scaffidi, Chris Bogart, Margaret Burnett, Allen Cypher, Mary Shaw, ","Journal of Visual Languages & Computing, Volume 21, Issue 5, December 2010, Pages 277-291, ","To help people find a code that they might want to reuse, repositories of end-user code typically sort scripts by number of downloads, ratings, or other information based on prior uses of the code. However, this information is unavailable when the code is new or when it has not yet been reused. Addressing this problem requires identifying reusable code based solely on information that exists when a script is created. To provide such a model for web macro scripts, we identified script traits that might plausibly predict reuse, then used IBM CoScripter repository logs to statistically test how well each corresponded to actual reuse. These tests confirmed that the traits generally did correspond to higher levels of reuse as anticipated. We then developed a machine learning model that uses these traits as features to predict reuse of macros. Evaluating this model on repository logs showed that its accuracy is comparable to that of existing machine learning models for predicting reuse〞but with a much simpler structure. Sensitivity analysis revealed that our model is quite robust; its quality is greatly reduced only when parameters are set to such extreme values that the model becomes inordinately selective. Testing the model with individual traits revealed those that provided the best predictions on their own. Based on these results, we outline opportunities for using our model to improve repositories of end-user code."

Challenges for rear hospital care of Wenchuan Earthquake casualties: experience from West China Hospital,"Ying-kang SHI, Lan-lan WANG, Yi-dan LIN, Fu-xing PEI, Yan Me KANG, ","Chinese Journal of Traumatology (English Edition), Volume 13, Issue 3, June 2010, Pages 131-136, ","To review the challenges and counter-measures in the hospital care for Wenchuan earthquake casualties and draw lessons for the protective response in the future. Medical records and laboratory findings of the victims admitted in West China Hospital (WCH) were retrospectively analyzed. Related data were compared between beforemath and aftermath of the earthquake and between WCH and frontier county hospitals. One thousand and thirty-one earthquake survivors were hospitalized, 1358 victims underwent surgery and 142 victims were transferred to intensive care unit. The incidence of infection, crush syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was 39.6%, 20.7% and 2.3% respectively. Wound classification showed that the incidence of extremity damage was 72%, while the incidence of chest trauma, abdominal trauma and brain trauma was less than 10% respectively. Isolating rates of environmental pathogens were increased in the aftermath of earthquake, and the spectrum of the pathogens and related antibiotic sensitivities were quite different from those in the beforemath of earthquake. The social economic and population conditions in the earthquake-stricken areas affected the composition of the victims and the geographic features restricted the efficiency of rescue. Trauma-induced MODS, crush syndrome and severe infections all constituted the dilemma for the hospital care, to resolve whether the multidiscipline team work was proved to be an optimizing choice. For a more effective disaster protective response in the future, the study on rescue plan and the ladder therapies for massive casualties should be potentiated."
An analytical solution to lateral buckling control of subsea pipelines by distributed buoyancy sections,"Gang Li, Lichao Zhan, Hao Li, ","Thin-Walled Structures, Volume 107, October 2016, Pages 221-230, ","Lateral buckling is the primary buckling form of the subsea pipelines. A promising recent practice is to the distributed buoyancy sections to control the lateral buckling of subsea pipeline. In this study, an analytical solution is deduced for the lateral buckling of the pipeline with buoyancy sections in the entire design region. However, numerical difficulty was encountered during the solution of the design equations. To overcome this difficulty, we adopt a response surface method (RSM) for the solution of nonlinear equation system. A strategy of multi-response-surface is proposed by dividing the entire design region into several partial domains and establishing different kinds of response surfaces for each region. A framework for lateral buckling control of subsea pipelines using distributed buoyancy sections is presented. Several illustrative examples demonstrate that the proposed method has a high efficiency and accuracy in solving the problem of the lateral buckling control."

The gypsy moth submodel simulates population dynamics on a 1-ha basis and includes models of dispersal, development, consumption, reproduction, and mortality. Results from the simulations indicate forest composition is an important determinant of the number, magnitude, and duration of gypsy moth outbreaks. The usefulness and potential modifications of the model for use as a tool in examining this inevitable ecological perturbation on the North Carolina Piedmont are discussed."
Centrifuge modeling of batter pile foundations under earthquake excitation,"Zheng Li, Sandra Escoffier, Panagiotis Kotronis, ","Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, Volume 88, September 2016, Pages 176-190, ","Although batter pile foundations are widely used in civil engineering structures, their behavior under seismic loadings is not yet thoroughly understood. This paper provides insights about the differences in the behavior of batter and vertical piles under seismic soil-pile-superstructure interaction. An experimental dynamic centrifuge program is presented, where the influences of the base shaking signal and the height of the gravity center of the superstructure are investigated. Various seismic responses are analyzed (displacement and rotation of the pile cap, total shear force at the pile cap level, overturning moment, residual bending moment, total bending moment and axial forces in piles). It is found that in certain cases batter piles play a beneficial role on the seismic behavior of the pile foundation system. The performance of batter piles depends not only on the characteristics of the earthquakes (frequency content and amplitude) but also on the type of superstructures they support. This novel experimental work provides a new experimental database to better understand the behavior of batter pile foundations in seismic regions."

Dynamic load identification for stochastic structures based on Gegenbauer polynomial approximation and regularization method,"Jie Liu, Xingsheng Sun, Xu Han, Chao Jiang, Dejie Yu, ","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, Volumes 56每57, May 2015, Pages 35-54, ","Based on the Gegenbauer polynomial expansion theory and regularization method, an analytical method is proposed to identify dynamic loads acting on stochastic structures. Dynamic loads are expressed as functions of time and random parameters in time domain and the forward model of dynamic load identification is established through the discretized convolution integral of loads and the corresponding unit-pulse response functions of system. Random parameters are approximated through the random variables with 竹-probability density function (PDFs) or their derivative PDFs. For this kind of random variables, Gegenbauer polynomial expansion is the unique correct choice to transform the problem of load identification for a stochastic structure into its equivalent deterministic system. Just via its equivalent deterministic system, the load identification problem of a stochastic structure can be solved by any available deterministic methods. With measured responses containing noise, the improved regularization operator is adopted to overcome the ill-posedness of load reconstruction and to obtain the stable and approximate solutions of certain inverse problems and the valid assessments of the statistics of identified loads. Numerical simulations demonstrate that with regard to stochastic structures, the identification and assessment of dynamic loads are achieved steadily and effectively by the presented method."
Stability of developing flow in a two-dimensional channel〞Symmetric vs. antisymmetric disturbances,"Suresh C. Gupta, Vijay K. Garg, ","Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Volume 27, Issue 3, July 1981, Pages 363-368, ","Disturbances applied to the developing flow in a two-dimensional channel are studied. Symmetric disturbances produce, in near inlet region, almost the same critical values of each of Reynolds number, wave number and frequency as do the anti-symmetric types. As the flow develops, however, the symmetric disturbance yields the lower critical values. Moreover, this discrepancy widens with increasing distance along the channel axis from the inlet.For some combinations of Reynolds number and disturbance frequency, the developing flow is found to be (spatially) stable against symmetric disturbances, but unstable with respect to antisymmetric forms. This is in direct contrast to the stability behaviour for the fully-developed flow."

The purpose of this study was to examine whether pentoxifylline would inhibit the expression of inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor a (TNF), and thereby decrease the pathophysiology of acute porcine pleuropneumonia. E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bacterial extracts of A. pleuropneumoniae 每 induced elevations in TNF mRNA which were fully abrogated by addition of pentoxifylline in both alveolar macrophage and neutrophil cultures. A 30% reduction in the level of LPS-induced interleukin (IL)-1b mRNA levels also was achieved in macrophages. Pentoxifylline did not affect either IL- la or IL-8 expression in vitro. Pentoxifylline therapy in vivo significantly reduced the number of band neutrophils in swine but did not reduce the pathology associated with pleuropneumonia, including changes in serum zinc, iron, or haptoglobin. Neither did it alter TNF, IL-1, IL-6, or IL-8 expression. Measurement of pentoxifylline and its metabolites in pig sera suggested that efficacious doses of pentoxifylline were probably not achieved in vivo. However, subcutaneous doses of pentoxifylline higher than 25 mg/kg produced transient diarrhea, vomiting, and tremors. These results suggest that pentoxifylline is an effective pharmacological tool for the dissection of cytokine regulation in vitro, but inhibitory concentrations may not be achievable for in vivo pharmacological use in swine."

Relative survival and relative excess risk of death from cancer were calculated for each of 17 health areas in New South Wales, Australia. There were statistically significant differences in survival across areas for both cancers after adjusting for demographic factors. The variation remained for colon cancer but was reduced for rectal cancer after adjustment for spread of disease at diagnosis. This persistent variation in colon cancer survival suggests that variation in treatment contributes to it, and there is separate evidence for such variation. Of the 7186 patients whose deaths within five years were attributable to colorectal cancer, 784 could have had their survival increased to more than five years if the excess risk of death in all areas was reduced to the 20th centile of its distribution.

The results show that the fracture mode can be generally described as ductile transgranular fracture in as-extruded condition and intergranular fracture in peak-aged condition. In as-extruded condition, the ductile transgranular fracture occurs by the formation and transgranular propagation of the microcrack from the broken primary phases. However, as the collaboration effects of precipitates inside grains and on the grain boundaries have the tendency to reduce the cohesive strength of the grain boundary, and make the grain boundaries the favorable path for crack propagation, the intergranular fracture occurs in peak-aged condition."

The levels, variations, compositions and size distributions were investigated. The sources were quantified by two-way and three-way receptor models (PMF2, ME2-2way and ME2-3way). Consistent results were found: the primary source categories contributed 63.4% (PMF2), 64.8% (ME2-2way) and 66.8% (ME2-3way) to PM10, and contributed 60.9% (PMF2), 65.5% (ME2-2way) and 61.0% (ME2-3way) to PM2.5. Secondary sources contributed 31.8% (PMF2), 32.9% (ME2-2way) and 31.7% (ME2-3way) to PM10, and 35.0% (PMF2), 33.8% (ME2-2way) and 36.0% (ME2-3way) to PM2.5. The size distribution of source categories was estimated better by the ME2-3way method. The three-way model can simultaneously consider chemical species, temporal variability and PM sizes, while a two-way model independently computes datasets of different sizes. A method called source directional apportionment (SDA) was employed to quantify the contributions from various directions for each source category. Crustal dust from east-north-east (ENE) contributed the highest to both PM10 (12.7%) and PM2.5 (9.7%) in Chengdu, followed by the crustal dust from south-east (SE) for PM10 (9.8%) and secondary nitrate & secondary organic carbon from ENE for PM2.5 (9.6%). Source contributions from different directions are associated with meteorological conditions, source locations and emission patterns during the sampling period. These findings and methods provide useful tools to better understand PM pollution status and to develop effective pollution control strategies.Download high-res image (138KB)Download full-size image"

A recent Australian study compared patient results for seven cTnI assays and showed that between-method variation was approximately 2- to 5-fold.A major reason for poor method agreement is the lack of a suitable common reference material for the calibration of cTnI assays by manufacturers. Purified complexed troponin material lacks adequate commutability for all assays; hence a serum-based secondary reference material is required for cTnI with value assignment by a higher order reference measurement procedure.There is considerable debate about how best to achieve comparability of results for heterogeneous analytes such as cTnI, whether it should be via the harmonisation or the standardisation process. Whereas harmonisation depends upon consensus value assignment and uses those commercial methods which give the closest agreement at the time, standardisation comes closer to the true value through a reference measurement system that is based upon long-term calibration traceability.The current paper describes standardisation efforts by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine Working Group on Standardization of cTnI (IFCC WG-TNI) to establish a reference immunoassay measurement procedure for cTnI of a higher order than current commercial immunoassay methods and a commutable secondary reference material for cTnI to which companies can reference their calibration materials."
Cdc45/Mcm2-7/GINS complex down-regulation mediates S phase arrest in okadaic acid-induced cell damage,"Mei Feng, Mi Zhou, Ling-ling Fu, Jiang-jia Cai, Jin Xu, ","Toxicon, Volume 152, 15 September 2018, Pages 16-22, ","Okadaic acid (OA) is one of the most common and widespread marine toxins and causes acute gastrointestinal symptoms known as diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP) in humans. Although OA is not classified as a typical neurotoxin, an increasing number of studies have reported its neurotoxic effects. However, most of the available studies have focused on OA-induced inhibition of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, while the molecular mechanism of OA-induced neurotoxicity remains largely unclear. To better understand the potentially toxicological profile of OA, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage and alterations in gene expression in the human neuroblastoma cell line SHSY5Y upon OA exposure were determined using flow cytometry, comet assay, and transcriptome microarray. The results showed that OA could induce cell cycle arrest at S phase and might be involved in significant DNA strand breaks. Gene expression profiling indicated that the differentially expressed genes after OA exposure were significantly enriched in the ※DNA replication§ and ※cell cycle§ pathways. Real-time PCR result had further validated that down-regulation of the Cdc45/Mcm2-7/GINS complex might be the major factor regulating those alterations. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of OA-induced neurotoxicity, and the current data may also provide a basis for future studies."
MER-25 does not inhibit the activation of aggression by testosterone in adult Rockland〞Swiss mice,"Neal G. Simon, Ronald Gandelman, Steven M. Howard, ","Psychoneuroendocrinology, Volume 6, Issue 2, 1981, Pages 131-137, ","The effect of ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25), an antiestrogen, on testosterone or estrogen induced aggression was evaluated in mice. In accord with previous data, both hormones activated fighting in gonadectomized males and TP induced aggression in ovariectomized females. Concurrent antiestrogen treatment, while significantly suppressing the ability of EB to promote aggression, did not block the capacity of TP to induce fighting in gonadectomized males or females. These data suggest that the aromatization of androgens within the central nervous system may not be essential for the promotion of aggression by testosterone in adult Rockland〞Swiss mice."

The etiology and pathogenesis of Crohn's gastritis are poorly understood, treatment approaches are limited, and there are not many suitable animal models for study. We characterized the features and mechanisms of chronic gastritis in SAMP1/YitFc (SAMP) mice, a spontaneous model of CD-like ileitis, along with possible therapeutic approaches.Stomachs from specific pathogen-free and germ-free SAMP and AKR mice (controls) were evaluated histologically; the presence of Helicobacter spp was tested in fecal pellets by polymerase chain reaction analysis. In vivo gastric permeability was quantified by fractional excretion of sucrose, and epithelial tight junction protein expression was measured by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. The effects of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or corticosteroids were measured, and the ability of pathogenic immune cells to mediate gastritis was assessed in adoptive transfer experiments.SAMP mice developed Helicobacter-negative gastritis, characterized by aggregates of mononuclear cells, diffuse accumulation of neutrophils, and disruption of epithelial architecture; SAMP mice also had increased gastric permeability compared with controls, without alterations in expression of tight junction proteins. The gastritis and associated permeability defect observed in SAMP mice were independent of bacterial colonization and reduced by administration of corticosteroids but not a PPI. CD4+ T cells isolated from draining mesenteric lymph nodes of SAMP mice were sufficient to induce gastritis in recipient SCID mice.In SAMP mice, gastritis develops spontaneously and has many features of CD-like ileitis. These mice are a useful model to study Helicobacter-negative, immune-mediated Crohn's gastritis."

The wastewater containing azo dye acid red B was then subjected to photocatalytic degradation with photocatalyst TiO2 and UV as light source in a slurry photocatalytic membrane reactor, which included a double layer cylindrical photocatalytic reaction zone and a plate frame membrane separation part. Two kinds of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes PVDF700 and PAN700 were applied and the combined process with photocatalysis was operated by a continuous re-circulating mode during treatment. At first, the adsorption characteristic of the titanium dioxide catalyst under different pH values was analyzed and the optimal operation condition of the photocatalytic process was achieved by changing TiO2 dose and initial concentration of the dye. Then the performance of photocatalyst separation process by ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated. It was found that the degradation of acid red B was followed by first-order kinetics and the efficiency of photocatalysis can be evaluated by the initial reaction rate. Finally, the conglomeration and hydrophilizion phenomena by TiO2 in the coupling system and its effect to different ultrafiltration membranes were analyzed."
Stability of nonparallel developing flow in an annulus,"Vijay K. Garg, Suresh C. Gupta, ","Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Volume 35, Issue 1, October 1982, Pages 35-46, ","The linear spatial stability of the developing flow in a concentric annulus, incorporating all nonparallel effects, is described. The disturbance is assumed to be axisymmetric. The velocity profile in the developing flow region is obtained by an implicit finite-difference scheme. The method of multiple scales is used to account for the nonparallel effects. The fourth order Runge-Kutta method is used for integration along with a selective application of the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization technique for circumventing the parasitic error-growth problem.It is found that the growth rate of the disturbance stream function yields the minimum critical Reynolds number. The critical Reynolds number versus the axial location curves exhibit a minimum and the location of this minimum shifts downstream as the diameter ratio reduces. At a given axial location the critical Reynolds number generally decreases with the diameter ratio. The difference between the critical Reynolds number evaluated from the parallel flow theory and that based on the growth rate of the disturbance stream function varies with the diameter ratio and decreases as the flow develops."

The results showed that the high-entropy alloys consisted of BCC phase and eutectic structure, which contained FCC phase and M2 B. With boron addition, the content of BCC phase increased while that of eutectic structure decreased. The wear resistance of the high-entropy coatings was considerably improved with increasing addition of boron, and accordingly, the FeCoCrNiAlB0. 75 coating showed the best wear resistance."

Colistin and polymyxin B GNX2F results showed acceptable essential agreement with BMD for MICS without interpretation. Colistin VM errors with EUCAST breakpoints were due to MIC variability in the 2 to 4 米g/mL range that could be addressed by establishing an intermediate category."

Microbial ecology of meat slicers as determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis,"Alexandria W. Mertz, Ok Kyung Koo, Corliss A. O'Bryan, Rub谷n Morawicki, Steven C. Ricke, ","Food Control, Volume 42, August 2014, Pages 242-247, ","Cross-contamination of pathogens and spoilage bacteria during slicing of ready to eat meats is an important factor that has been shown to impact both food quality and consumers' safety. In this study we analyzed the microbial diversity and total microbiological ecology of different niches on 8 deli meat slicers using standard plate counts as well as culture-independent PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Using aerobic plate counts it was determined that areas underneath the slicer and on the back plate had the highest total bacterial populations. There was slight similarity between total aerobic plate counts by slicer and the number of bacterial genera/species determined by DGGE. The DGGE analysis demonstrated that members of the genus Pseudomonas were the most common bacteria to be found on slicers. This may serve as an estimate of the effectiveness of current cleaning and sanitizing practices to remove biofilms, a possible role for competitive inhibition in preventing colonization by pathogens and an indication of the range and diversity of non-pathogens on these food contact surfaces."
"Modulation of serotonergic transmission by eltoprazine in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia: Behavioral, molecular, and synaptic mechanisms","Veronica Ghiglieri, Desiree Mineo, Anna Vannelli, Fabrizio Cacace, Barbara Picconi, ","Neurobiology of Disease, Volume 86, February 2016, Pages 140-153, ","L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) represent the main side effect of Parkinson's Disease (PD) therapy. Among the various pharmacological targets for novel therapeutic approaches, the serotonergic system represents a promising one. In experimental models of PD and in PD patients the development of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) and LIDs, respectively, is accompanied by the impairment of bidirectional synaptic plasticity in key structures such as striatum. Recently, it has been shown that the 5-HT1A/1B receptor agonist, eltoprazine, significantly decreased LIDs in experimental PD and human patients. Despite the fact that several papers have tested this and other serotonergic drugs, nothing is known about the electrophysiological consequences on this combined serotonin receptors modulation at striatal neurons.The present study demonstrates that activation of 5-HT1A/1B receptors reduces AIMs via the restoration of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and synaptic depotentiation in a sub-set of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs). This recovery is associated with the normalization of D1 receptor-dependent cAMP/PKA and ERK/mTORC signaling pathways, and the recovery of NMDA receptor subunits balance, indicating these events as key elements in AIMs induction. Moreover, we analyzed whether the manipulation of the serotonergic system might affect motor behavior and cognitive performances. We found that a defect in locomotor activity in parkinsonian and L-DOPA-treated rats was reversed by eltoprazine treatment. Conversely, the impairment in the striatal-dependent learning was found exacerbated in L-DOPA-treated rats and eltoprazine failed to recover it."
"Modulation of Fear-Potentiated Startle and Vocalizations in Juvenile Rhesus Monkeys by Morphine, Diazepam, and Buspirone","James T. Winslow, Pamela L.

We have described a paradigm for measuring fear-potentiated, whole-body acoustic startle in nonhuman primates and have developed a protocol for maintaining fear-potentiated startle over repeated sessions with minimal extinction to allow measurement of pharmacological effects on fear-potentiated startle by using within-subjects designs in relatively small groups of monkeys.A novel, within-subjects testing protocol was used to examine the effects of three compounds in rhesus monkeys that have anxiolytic effects in rodents on fear-potentiated startle but that differ in their mechanism of action. Spontaneous vocalizations during testing also were recorded. Juvenile monkeys that were trained to associate a visual stimulus with a fear-inducing air blast to the face were tested after acute administration of different doses of buspirone diazepam, morphine, or vehicle.Monkeys rapidly developed a robust and persistent elevation of startle response in the presence of the CS during repeated testing sessions. Diazepam and morphine produced dose-related reductions of fear-potentiated startle. Buspirone did not significantly reduce fear-potentiated startle at the doses tested, although a trend was evident at the highest dose. All drugs reduced rates of coo vocalizations during startle testing.These fear-potentiated startle results suggest that rhesus monkeys have a pharmacological profile with respect to these compounds that is closer to humans than to rats. This demonstrates the value of examining the effects of drugs on fear-potentiated startle in nonhuman primates."

We assessed the utility of passive reporting for GV surveillance by reviewing all Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports of any post-smallpox vaccination rash in civilians and military personnel.We reviewed all reports submitted to VAERS between 12/12/2002 and 3/1 2004 for post-smallpox vaccine (SPV) rashes concerning civilians and military personnel. We evaluated the information contained in the reports independent of VAERS adverse event coding (GV or not GV). We classified the rash reports based on the recently published GV case definition from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Of the 936 rash reports after SPV, 92 were coded as GV. We classified 12 of the 92 as probable GV, and 1 as confirmed GV (14% probable or confirmed). Among the 844 reports not coded as GV, we classified 32 as either probable or confirmed GV (4%). Probable or confirmed reports that were coded as GV were similar to probable or confirmed reports not coded as GV with respect to demographic characteristics of the report subjects, and the location and phenotype (e.g., pustular, vesicular, etc.) of the rashes.A prospective study that applies well-defined clinical, histopathological, and laboratory criteria to smallpox-vaccinated patients with rashes would be necessary to distinguish GV from common alternative diagnoses with which it is easily confused."

In this study, we developed a hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope L particle (i.e., bio-nanocapsule (BNC)) outwardly displaying a tandem form of protein G-derived IgG Fc-binding domain and protein L-derived IgG Fab-binding domain (GL-BNC). When conjugated with the macrophage-targeting ligand, mouse IgG2a (mIgG2a), the GL-BNC itself, and the liposome-fused GL-BNC (i.e., GL-virosome) spontaneously initiated aggregation by bridging between the Fc-binding domain and Fab-binding domain with mIgG2a. The aggregates were efficiently taken up by macrophages, whereas this was inhibited by latrunculin B, a phagocytosis-specific inhibitor. The mIgG2a-GL-virosome containing doxorubicin exhibited higher cytotoxicity toward macrophages than conventional liposomes and other BNC-based virosomes. Thus, GL-BNCs and GL-virosomes may constitute promising macrophage-targeting and phagocytosis-inducing DDS nanocarriers.We have developed a novel macrophage-targeting and phagocytosis-inducing bio-nanocapsule (BNC)-based nanocarrier named GL-BNC, which comprises a hepatitis B virus envelope L particle outwardly displaying protein G-derived IgG Fc- and protein L-derived IgG Fab-binding domains in tandem.

The results indicate that more precipitation cores can be provided by the crystal defects caused by the plastic deformation, as well as increasing the amount of 汕' phases, and the formation of precipitations at grain boundaries and interfaces between the twins and matrix. Because of an increase in precipitations, the dislocation slipping during deformation process is effectively hindered and the matrix is strengthened, especially for the 2% deformed alloy which can achieve a good combination of strength and ductility. With increasing the plastic deformation, the microcracks occur at the interface between grain boundary precipitations and matrix, and then propagate intergranularly. When intergranular fracture combines with the formation of smoothing facets on the fracture surface, the tensile properties decrease."

Keller, ","Animal Behaviour, Volume 68, Issue 5, November 2004, Pages 1055-1063, ","Male song sparrows sing repertoires of 4每13 distinct song types and have proved a valuable model for testing hypotheses concerning the function and evolution of song complexity. Captive female song sparrows solicit more copulations in response to playback of larger repertoires, yet it remains unclear whether male repertoire size influences female mate choice in natural situations. We used long-term data from free-living song sparrows inhabiting Mandarte Island, British Columbia, Canada, to investigate whether male song repertoire size predicted three components of reproductive performance during the first year: territory acquisition, mating success and laying date. Across males whose song was recorded, males with larger repertoires were not more likely to acquire a territory, to acquire a larger territory or to settle sooner. However, after we controlled for territory size and between-year variation in the population sex ratio, first-year males with larger repertoires were more likely to mate. This was because they were more likely to pair with newly settled females, not because they were more likely to acquire territories where older females were already resident. After we controlled for territory size and between-year variation in breeding date, newly settled females laid earlier when mated with males with larger repertoires. Together with the results of previous mate choice experiments, these patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that male song repertoire size is a sexually selected trait that influences female mate choice in song sparrows."

Interactive active contour with kernel descriptor,"Hao Li, Maoguo Gong, Qiguang Miao, Bin Wang, ","Information Sciences, Volume 450, June 2018, Pages 53-72, ","Pixel-wise active contour models usually utilize local edge information and/or region statistics. These models are unable to ideally segment real-world objects, especially those in heterogeneous or cluttered images because of a lack of local spatial correlations. To represent the characteristics of the targets precisely, a kernel-descriptor-based active contour model is proposed to address the problem of a lack of local spatial correlations in image segmentation. First, image patch features are extracted and are clustered into several clusters. The initial contour is obtained from user inputs, and then the corresponding template feature sets of the clusters are constructed. Second, we utilize the template feature sets to formulate our energy functional, subject to a constraint on the total length of the region boundaries. Finally, a level set method is employed to estimate the resulting evolution. The proposed method utilizes the kernel descriptor as the high-dimensional feature and performs well on heterogeneous and cluttered images. Experimental results on real images suggest a clear superiority of the proposed method."

Recently, the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were reported to play important roles in osteosarcoma progression. The present study examined the potential role of the lncRNA, Colorectal Neoplasia Differentially Expressed (CRNDE) and molecular mechanisms underlying osteosarcoma progression. In the present study, we identified that CRNDE was up-regulated in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines, and CRNDE expression level was significantly higher in osteosarcoma tissues from patients with advanced stage and metastasis. Overexpression of CRNDE promoted cell growth, cell proliferation, cell invasion and migration, and increased cell population at S phase with a decreased cell population at G0/G1 phase in MG-63 cells. Knock-down of CRNDE suppressed cell growth, cell proliferation, cell invasion and migration, and decreased cell population at S phase with an increased cell population at G0/G1 phase in U2OS cells. Overexpression of CRNDE was found to enhance the activity of Notch1 signaling and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in MG-63 cells, while knock-down of CRNDE exerted the opposite effects in U2OS cells. The in vivo results showed that knock-down of CRNDE suppressed the tumor growth in the nude mice inoculated with osteosarcoma cells, and knock-down of CRNDE also suppressed the mRNA expression of Notch1, JAG1, N-cadherin, vimentin, and increased the mRNA expression of E-cadherin in the tumor tissues.

Cardiovascular effects of carbon monoxide and cigarette smoking,"Shoshana Zevin, Sandra Saunders, Steven G Gourlay, Peyton Jacob, Neal L Benowitz, ","Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Volume 38, Issue 6, 15 November 2001, Pages 1633-1638, ","OBJECTIVESThis study was designed to compare the effects of inhaled carbon monoxide (CO), administered to achieve concentrations similar to those found in cigarette smoking, with the effects of cigarette smoking and air inhalation on heart rate and blood pressure, catecholamine release, platelet activation and C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation.BACKGROUNDCarbon monoxide may contribute to smoking-induced cardiovascular disease. Exposure to environmental CO has been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Animal and in vitro studies suggest that CO may contribute to atherosclerosis and endothelial injury. There is conflicting evidence about the hemodynamic consequences of exposure to CO and its role in platelet activation.METHODSIn a single-blind, crossover design, 12 healthy smokers inhaled CO at 1,200 ppm to 1,500 ppm to simulate CO intake from cigarette smoking, inhaled air on a similar schedule and smoked 20 cigarettes per day, each for seven days. Mean carboxyhemoglobin was 5 ㊣ 1% on CO treatment, 6 ㊣ 1% while smoking and 0.4 ㊣ 0.2% on air inhalations.RESULTSThere was no difference in blood pressure between the treatments. Mean heart rate was higher during cigarette smoking compared with CO and air inhalations (75 beats/min vs. 66 beats/min; p < 0.05). Plasma levels of platelet factor 4 and CRP and urine epinephrine and norepinephrine were higher while smoking, with no effect of CO compared with air.CONCLUSIONSCarbon monoxide administered under conditions similar to those of cigarette smoking had no significant effect on blood pressure, heart rate, plasma catecholamines, platelet aggregation or CRP. The short-term chronotropic effect, adrenergic-activating, platelet-activating and CRP-increasing effects of smoking in healthy smokers are probably due to components of cigarette smoke other than CO."
River birds＊ response to hydrological extremes: New vulnerability index and conservation implications,"Alexander Royan, David M. Hannah, S. James Reynolds, David G. Noble, Jonathan P. Sadler, ","Biological Conservation, Volume 177, September 2014, Pages 64-73, ","There is growing evidence that as a consequence of climate change the frequency of extreme hydrological events will increase. Predicting the impacts of these extreme events on ecological systems is a major research challenge. It is predicted that change in future river flows, characterised by greater occurrence of floods and droughts, will have profound impacts on aquatic invertebrate communities by removing sensitive species and restructuring food networks. However, it remains unclear how an increase in these hydrological extremes will impact on riparian communities and species at higher trophic levels. Here, we describe a new methodology that facilitates the integration of quantitative outputs of species＊ distribution models with the expert knowledge of conservation practitioners to produce a species＊ vulnerability index (SVI). Using our SVI framework, we assessed and ranked the vulnerability of 16 river bird species to a potential climate-induced shift in the frequency, duration and magnitude of flood and drought events. Vulnerability was associated primarily with ecological traits that restrict species to in-channel riverine habitat. Whilst the SVI was developed to assess species＊ vulnerability to hydrological extremes on rivers, it is equally applicable to other environmental domains as well as a range of avian and non-avian taxa. Furthermore, this original methodological approach provides researchers and managers with a valuable conservation tool that allows them to identify the species most vulnerable to climate change impacts and plan mitigation and adaptation strategies."

Current-induced effect on resistivity and magnetoresistance of La0.67Ba0.33MnO3 manganite,"Rajesh Kumar, Ajai K. Gupta, D. P. Singh, Vijay Kumar, Neeraj Khare, ","Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials, Volume 320, Issue 21, November 2008, Pages 2741-2745, ",The influence of dc biasing current on temperature dependence of resistivity and low-field magnetoresistance (MR) of La0.67Ba0.33MnO3 bulk sample is reported. A prominent finding is the change in resistivity around the insulator-to-metal transition temperature (TIM) and the change in MR around the ferromagnetic transition temperature (TC). The decrease in MR around TC at higher biasing current indicates a strong interaction between carrier spin and spin of Mn ions resulting in a higher alignment of Mn ion spins. Change in resistivity around TIM is interpreted in the framework of percolative conduction model based on the mixed phase of itinerant electrons and localized magnetic polarons.
Maternal serum 汐-fetoprotein levels in pregnancies complicated by diabetes: Implications for screening programs,"Alice O. Martin, Lisa M. Dempsey, John Minogue, Kiang Liu, Norbert Freinkel, ","American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Volume 163, Issue 4, Part 1, October 1990, Pages 1209-1216, ","Maternal serum a-fetoprotein may be reduced in diabetic pregnancies, but the association with elevated glycosylated hemoglobin has been controversial. We tested the hypothesis that reductions in maternal serum a-fetoprotein may reflect the same phenomena that can also impair normal rates of embryo growth in the presence of poorly compensated maternal diabetes. If so, associations would be expected among maternal serum 汐-fetoprotein, embryo rates of growth, and levels of glycosylated hemoglobin reflective of regulation of maternal diabetes during the period of organogenesis. We found maternal serum a-fetoprotein levels in 93 pregnant patients with diabetes to be negatively associated with the earliest (4 to 12 weeks) glycosylated hemoglobin determinations. At glycosylated hemoglobin values <9.6% (which approximates the upper quartile), all maternal serum a-fetoprotein values fell below the median for patients without diabetes (below 0.8 multiple of the median after weight adjustment). Moreover, there was a trend for pregnancies with lower maternal serum a-fetoprotein levels and higher glycosylated hemoglobin values to also demonstrate early fetal growth delay as measured by ultrasonography."

To achieve this goal, the use of dimensionless relative retention times (iRT), defined on the basis of peptide standard retention times (RT), has lately emerged as a powerful tool. The robustness, reproducibility and utility of this strategy were examined for the first time in a multicentric setting, involving 28 laboratories that included 24 of the Spanish network of proteomics laboratories (ProteoRed-ISCIII). According to the results obtained in this study, dimensionless retention time values (iRTs) demonstrated to be a useful tool for transferring and sharing peptide retention times across different chromatographic set-ups both intra- and inter-laboratories. iRT values also showed very low variability over long time periods. Furthermore, parallel quantitative analyses showed a high reproducibility despite the variety of experimental strategies used, either MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) or pseudoMRM, and the diversity of analytical platforms employed.From the very beginning of proteomics as an analytical science there has been a growing interest in developing standardized methods and experimental procedures in order to ensure the highest quality and reproducibility of the results. In this regard, the recent (2012) introduction of the dimensionless retention time concept has been a significant advance. In our multicentric (28 laboratories) study we explore the usefulness of this concept in the context of a targeted proteomics experiment, demonstrating that dimensionless retention time values is a useful tool for transferring and sharing peptide retention times across different chromatographic set-ups.Download high-res image (109KB)Download full-size image"
Upper bound analysis of 3D static and seismic active earth pressure,"Xiao-Li Yang, Zheng-Wei Li, ","Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, Volume 108, May 2018, Pages 18-28, ","This paper adopts a three-dimensional (3D) rotational failure mechanism to calculate the static and seismic active earth pressure acting on rigid retaining walls within the framework of the kinematic approach of limit analysis. The failure mechanism can be generated through rotating a varying circle defined by two log-spirals, and a plane strain block is inserted into the mechanism for consideration of retaining walls with different widths. Quasi-static representation using the seismic coefficient concept is applied to consider horizontal earthquake effects for the seismic active earth pressure calculation. Two cases with the different points of action of resultant earth pressure are included in this study. In the realm of soil plasticity, the new expressions about 3D active earth pressure are educed from the work-energy balance equation. The critical solution is obtained from an optimization scheme where the maximum of active earth pressure is obtained. Numerical results for different parameters are calculated and presented in the forms of graphs and tables, which may serve as a useful tool for practical application. Compared with existing 2D and 3D solutions, the validity of the proposed method is shown. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the effects of different parameters on the static and seismic active earth pressure under 3D conditions."
Scalable orchestration of software defined service overlay network for multipath transmission,"Yunchong Guan, Weimin Lei, Wei Zhang, Shaowei Liu, Hao Li, ","Computer Networks, Volume 137, 4 June 2018, Pages 132-146, ","Multipath transmission on overlay network is proved to effectively improve transmission quality for Internet applications requiring stringent QoS guarantees, e.g., real-time conversational applications. The orchestration of overlay nodes is the basis of overlay multipath transmission, which fundamentally impacts the management, control and transmission quality of overlay network. In this paper, we introduce SDN (Software Defined Networking) paradigm to orchestrate overlay nodes for optimal global management and intelligent forwarding control and we name the overlay multipath framework Software Defined Service Overlay Network (SDSON). To achieve efficient and reliable orchestration of nodes in SDSON, we focus on two major challenges, 1) the match between overlay and underlay networks for reducing the transmission quality degradation from the uncertainty of overlay paths, 2) the enhancement of scalability for eliminating control plane bottleneck of SDSON centralized structure. Correspondingly, we propose a scalable overlay orchestration structure. 1) coordinate-based global topology view of overlay nodes is employed to characterize and constrain relationships between overlay nodes. Coordinates are generated by using MDS-MAP to convert measured delays. And a balanced-binary-tree measure method is designed to balance measure loads. 2) The two-level distributed control plane is designed by decoupling control and management functions in control plane and together a novel collaborative control mechanism. The first level focuses on global management and the second concentrates on conducting global control with the collaborative control mechanism among distributed controllers. We use modified ISODATA with density-based initialization improvement to partition global topology view into distributed sub-domains, which are governed by controllers composing the second level control plane. Evaluations on OMNeT++ demonstrate that coordinate-based view matches well with practical underlay networks, sub-domains partition quality outperforms classical algorithms, and the scalable control planes with collaborative control mechanism alleviate control pressure and improve control performance efficiently."

Multi-species spatially-explicit indicators reveal spatially structured trends in bird communities,"Dario Massimino, Alison Johnston, David G. Noble, James W. Pearce-Higgins, ","Ecological Indicators, Volume 58, November 2015, Pages 277-285, ","Multi-species indicators are often used to assess biodiversity trends. By combining population trends across several species they summarise trends across a community. Composite indicators such as these are useful for examining general temporal patterns and may suggest important drivers of biodiversity change. However, they may also mask substantial spatial variation in population trends, particularly when they are calculated over large spatial regions. We produced spatially-explicit indicators for farmland and woodland bird communities in the UK and further separate these into trends for generalist and specialist species within each group. We found considerable spatial variation in the indicators, which is masked by indicators calculated at the national level. The farmland community indicator showed mostly positive trends in western areas and extensive declines in south-east England. The woodland community indicator showed a north每south divide, with increases in Scotland and northern England and stability in the southern regions. For both communities, indicator trends for specialist species were more negative than those for generalists. We found no significant difference in farmland community indicators between arable land and improved grassland. Woodland specialists had significantly more negative trends in broadleaf compared to coniferous woodlands, suggesting habitat-type is one of the drivers of changes in the woodland community. These spatial patterns in bird population trends may be used to highlight regional conservation priorities and identify where those may differ from the national scale. In combination with information about other environmental changes, they may also be used to develop hypotheses about potential drivers of change. We advocate that this approach is adopted for other taxa and geographical areas."

A probability density function discretization and approximation method for the dynamic load identification of stochastic structures,"Jie Liu, Xingsheng Sun, Kun Li, Chao Jiang, Xu Han, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, Volume 357, 24 November 2015, Pages 74-94, ","Aiming at structures containing random parameters with multi-peak probability density functions (PDFs) or great variable coefficients, an analytical method of probability density function discretization and approximation (PDFDA) is proposed for dynamic load identification. Dynamic loads are expressed as the functions of time and random parameters in time domain and the forward model is established through the discretized convolution integral of loads and the corresponding unit-pulse response functions. The PDF of each random parameter is discretized into several subintervals and in each subinterval the original PDF curve is approximated via uniform distribution PDF with equal probability value. Then the joint distribution model is built and hence the equivalent deterministic equations are solved to identify unknown loads. Inverse analysis is operated separately at each variable in the joint distribution model through regularization because of noise-contaminated measured responses. In order to assess the accuracy of identified results, PDF curves and statistical properties of loads are achieved based on the specially assumed distributions of identified loads. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the presented method."

Nevertheless, when examining only those already accumulating AD pathology (i.e., amyloid positive), low exercisers had higher mean levels of brain amyloid than high exercisers. Furthermore, the interaction between exercise and estimated years from expected symptom onset was a significant predictor of brain amyloid levels.Our findings indicate a relationship exists between self-reported exercise levels and brain amyloid in autosomal dominant AD mutation carriers."
Alterations in DNA helix stability due to base modifications can be evaluated using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis,"Mary Collins, Richard M. Myers, ","Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 198, Issue 4, 20 December 1987, Pages 737-744, ","DNA molecules that differ by a single base-pair can be separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis due to the sequence-specific melting properties of DNA. Base modifications such as methylation are also known to affect the melting temperature of DNA. We examined the final position of DNA fragments containing either 5-methyl-cytosine or 6-methyl-adenine in denaturing gradient gels. The presence of a single methylated base within an early melting domain resulted in a well-resolved shift in fragment position relative to the unmethylated sequence. In addition, fragments containing hemimethylated and fully methylated sites could be distinguished, and a proportionally larger shift was observed with an increasing number of methylated bases. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis thus provides a sensitive method for analyzing the methylation state of DNA, which is not dependent on the presence of restriction enzyme cleavage sites. We also demonstrate that denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate of the change in helix stability caused by modification of one or two bases in a complex DNA sequence. Such estimates should allow more accurate modeling of melting of natural DNA sequences."

Recent clinical studies have shown that dietary fish oil supplementation retards renal disease progression in patients with IgA nephropathy. The mechanism by which this effect occurs is unknown.The anti-Thy 1.1 (ATS) model of mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis was employed to test the hypothesis that dietary fish oil supplementation reduces mesangial cell proliferation following acute injury. Subcultured rat mesangial cells were used to determine the in vitro effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the primary components of fish oil, on proliferation.Following antithymocyte serum (ATS) administration, proteinuria was significantly decreased in animals treated with fish oil compared with sesame oil-treated controls. In ATS rats given fish oil, there was less mesangial cell and matrix expansion, mesangiolysis, or basement membrane disruption (忖% = -40%). ATS rats receiving fish oil had less glomerular cell proliferation (PCNA-忖% = -50%) and a reduction of 汐-smooth muscle actin expression (忖% = -27%) by mesangial cells. In subcultured rat mesangial cells, DHA, but not EPA, significantly inhibited proliferation.Fish oil inhibits mesangial cell activation and proliferation in ATS glomerulonephritis, reduces proteinuria, and decreases histologic evidence of glomerular damage. In vitro, the antiproliferative effects of fish oil are more likely related to the action of DHA. We suggest that orally administered fish oil, or purified DHA, may have a suppressive effect in acute phases or relapses of glomerulopathies by inhibiting activation and proliferation of mesangial cells."

Improving order-picking performance by converting a sequential zone-picking line into a zone-picking network,"Ying-Chin Ho, Jian-Wei Lin, ","Computers & Industrial Engineering, Volume 113, November 2017, Pages 241-255, ","In this study, we address the problems caused by the fixed-sequence-route constraint in a sequential zone-picking line by proposing a new zone-picking network that offers routing flexibility to orders. Although routing flexibility enables the proposed zone-picking network to be free of the problems caused by the fixed-sequence-route constraint in a sequential zone-picking line, it incurs a new problem 每 tote dispatching. This problem and another problem 每 order selection 每 both affect the performance of the proposed zone-picking network. In this paper, we study both problems and propose different methods (ranging from simple rules to complicated rules) for them. Computer simulations are conducted to understand the Total System Time (TST) performance of every individual rule and the mutual effects between tote-dispatching rules and order-selection rules. A smaller TST means the system can complete picking tasks with less time. Two environmental factors 每 order size and system workload 每 are considered in simulations. The analysis of simulation results shows because of its routing flexibility the proposed zone-picking network outperforms the sequential zone-picking line regardless of whichever flexible-routing tote-dispatching rule is used. Furthermore, the dispatching rule that lets orders begin their next picking operations as early as possible and the order-selection rule that considers the number of zone-visitation coincidences between the selected order and the orders currently in the system and the picking time of the selected order are the best dispatching rule and order-selection rule respectively. Finally, the analysis of simulation results indicates both environmental factors significantly affect the system＊s order-picking performance. For the order-size factor, it is found a greater order size leads to a greater TST. For the system-workload factor, it is found underload and overload can both lead to the poor TST performance."

Viewing the molecules in solution as a physical ＆cluster＊ of groups, or interaction sites, provides a framework through which the implicit assumptions may be cast in standard molecular terminology.

Alternatively, the latter approximations can be interpreted as the site analogue of the n-fluid theory for simple mixtures.

After the acrylic resin test specimens were fractured under a transverse load, the joint interface surfaces were prepared either as a butt joint, rabbeted joint, or rounded joint and then repaired with an autopolymerizing acrylic resin. Sixteen of the 45 specimens were repaired with the rabbeted joint, 15 specimens with a butt joint, and the remaining 14 specimens with a rounded joint.Three specimens required a higher second load to produce fracture. Two of these fractured through the repair material and one at the interface. In these instances, the repaired specimen was at least not weaker than the original. Only 6.3 per cent of the rabbeted joints, 20 per cent of the butt joints and 57 per cent of the rounded joints could be considered as properly made since the fracture line did not in these instances occur along the joint interface surfaces.A statistical analysis using a fixed-effect model as the analysis of variance and Scheffe's multiple comparison statistically showed that the mean of the rounded joint was significantly different from the mean of both the rabbet joint and the butt joint. This experimental data thus indicated that the rounded joint is clearly superior to the rabbeted joint and the butt joint."
Exploiting structural similarity of log files in fault diagnosis for Web service composition,"Xu Han, Binyang Li, Kam-Fai Wong, Zhongzhi Shi, ","CAAI Transactions on Intelligence Technology, Volume 1, Issue 1, January 2016, Pages 61-71, ","With increasing deployment of Web services, the research on the dependability and availability of Web service composition becomes more and more active. Since unexpected faults of Web service composition may occur in different levels at runtime, log analysis as a typical data-driven approach for fault diagnosis is more applicable and scalable in various architectures. Considering the trend that more and more service logs are represented using XML or JSON format which has good flexibility and interoperability, fault classification problem of semi-structured logs is considered as a challenging issue in this area. However, most existing approaches focus on the log content analysis but ignore the structural information and lead to poor performance. To improve the accuracy of fault classification, we exploit structural similarity of log files and propose a similarity based Bayesian learning approach for semi-structured logs in this paper. Our solution estimates degrees of similarity among structural elements from heterogeneous log data, constructs combined Bayesian network (CBN), uses similarity based learning algorithm to compute probabilities in CBN, and classifies test log data into most probable fault categories based on the generated CBN. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms other learning approaches on structural log datasets."
Mapping the human liver/islet glucose transporter (GLUT2) gene within a genetic linkage map of chromosome 3q using a (CA)n dinucleotide repeat polymorphism and characterization of the polymorphism in three racial groups,"Akira Matsutani, Anne Hing, Todd Steinbrueck, Rachel Janssen, Helen Donis-Keller, ","Genomics, Volume 13, Issue 3, July 1992, Pages 495-501, ","The human liver/islet glucose transporter (GLUT2), a candidate gene for diabetes, has been incorporated into a genetic linkage map for chromosome 3q using a (CA)n dinucleotide repeat polymorphism adjacent to the 3∩-end of exon 4a. We have found a total of nine alleles ranging in length from 153 to 169 nucleotides in three racial groups and have determined the precise structure of the variable region for four of the alleles by DNA sequencing. Five alleles were found to be common to the American Black, Caucasian, and Pima Indian racial groups studied. One allele (169 bp) was unique to American Blacks, and another rare allele (153 bp) was found only in the Caucasian population studied. Observed heterozygosity of the polymorphism in the Caucasian (CEPH) reference pedigree collection is 60%, for American Blacks 71%, and for Pima Indians 53%. An independent study recently identified the same dinucleotide repeat and found six alleles in a Caucasian population (Froguelet al., 1991), a result that we confirm; however, our sequencing data indicate a different molecular structure for the polymorphism for some of the alleles. We have constructed a new genetic linkage map of chromosome 3q uniquely placing the GLUT2 gene between flanking markers D3S26 and D3S43. The genetic map consists of 23 loci (25RFLPs and 2 (CA)n dinucleotide repeat markers) with 14 markers uniquely localized with odds of at least 1000:1. Three genes (FTHL4, TF, GLUT2) are integrated into the map, which spans a sex-average distance of 147.3 cM, 103.8 cM in males and 227.0 cM in females. Availability of this reasonably informative genetic marker at the GLUT2 locus should prove quite useful in genetic linkage and population association studies designed to identify inherited traits that might contribute to the diabetes phenotype."
Variations in mode-specific valuations of travel time reliability and in-vehicle crowding: Implications for demand estimation,"Hao Li, Kun Gao, Huizhao Tu, ","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, Volume 103, September 2017, Pages 250-263, ","This paper presents a two-stage Stated Preference survey to investigate the impacts of travel time reliability and in-vehicle crowding on the mode choice decisions across four different transport modes, i.e. car, metro, park and ride (P&R) and bus. The decisive attributes considered are average travel time, travel time reliability, cost and in-vehicle crowding. Five model specifications are defined for the parameter estimations. Significant interaction effects between in-vehicle crowding and travel time are found. Time multipliers are defined to represent the effects of in-vehicle crowding. In contrast, no evidence could be established for the interaction between in-vehicle crowding and travel time reliability. Results of the mode-specific valuations of travel time reliability and in-vehicle crowding, vary remarkably across the four different transport modes. In the mode-specific models, the range of time multipliers is estimated to be [1.44, 2.00]. Besides, demand estimates would be biased when the mode-specific willingness to pay (WTP) is ignored. For instance, the mode share of metro will be underestimated when its reliability level is high, and vice versa. This suggests that mode-specific WTP of travel time reliability and in-vehicle crowding should be considered in the demand estimations and in the earlier stage of public transport project appraisal."
PI3K污 promotes vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic modulation and transplant arteriosclerosis via a SOX9-dependent mechanism,"Qihong Yu, Wei Li, Dawei Xie, Xichuan Zheng, Zifang Song, ","EBioMedicine, In press, corrected proof, Available online 18 September 2018, ","Transplant arteriosclerosis (TA) remains the major cause of chronic graft failure in solid organ transplantation. The phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a key event for the initiation and progression of neointimal formation and TA. This study aims to explore the role and underlying mechanism of phosphoinositide 3-kinases 污 (PI3K污) in VSMC phenotypic modulation and TA.The rat model of aortic transplantation was established to detect PI3K污 expression and its role in neointimal formation and vascular remodeling in vivo. PI3K污 shRNA transfection was employed to knockdown PI3K污 gene. Aortic VSMCs was cultured and treated with TNF-汐 to explore the role and molecular mechanism of PI3K污 in VSMC phenotypic modulation.Activated PI3K污/p-Akt signaling was observed in aortic allografts and in TNF-汐-treated VSMCs. Lentivirus-mediated shRNA transfection effectively inhibited PI3K污 expression in medial VSMCs while restoring the expression of VSMC contractile genes, associated with impaired neointimal formation in aortic allografts. In cultured VSMCs, PI3K污 blockade with pharmacological inhibitor or genetic knockdown markedly abrogated TNF-汐-induced downregulation of VSMC contractile genes and increase in cellular proliferation and migration. Moreover, SOX9 located in nucleus competitively inhibited the interaction of Myocardin and SRF, while PI3K污 inhibition robustly reduced SOX9 expression and its nuclear translocation and repaired the Myocardin/SRF association.These results suggest that PI3K污 plays a critical role in VSMC phenotypic modulation via a SOX9-dependent mechanism. Therefore, PI3K污 in VSMCs may represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of TA.National Natural Science Foundation of China."
Use of Molecular Imaging to Predict Clinical Outcome in Patients With Rectal Cancer After Preoperative Chemotherapy and Radiation,"Andre Konski, Tianyu Li, Elin Sigurdson, Steven J. Cohen, Neal J.

Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University with 18-FDG-PET scanning before and after combined-modality neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy . The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) was measured from the tumor before and 3 to 4 weeks after completion of chemoradiation therapy preoperatively. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association of pretreatment SUV, posttreatment SUV, and % SUV decrease on pathologic complete response (pCR), and a Cox model was fitted to analyze disease-free survival.A total of 53 patients (FCCC, n = 41, RLCCC, n = 12) underwent pre- and postchemoradiation PET scanning between September 2000 and June 2006. The pCR rate was 31%. Univariate analysis revealed that % SUV decrease showed a marginally trend in predicting pCR (p = 0.08). In the multivariable analysis, posttreatment SUV was shown a predictor of pCR (p = 0.07), but the test results did not reach statistical significance. None of the investigated variables were predictive of disease-free survival.A trend was observed for % SUV decrease and posttreatment SUV predicting pCR in patients with rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiation therapy. Further prospective study with a larger sample size is warranted to better characterize the role of 18-FDG-PET for response prediction in patients with rectal cancer."
Food safety involving ingestion of foods and beverages prepared with phthalate-plasticizer-containing clouding agents,"Tzung-Hai Yen, Dan-Tzu Lin-Tan, Ja-Liang Lin, ","Journal of the Formosan Medical Association, Volume 110, Issue 11, November 2011, Pages 671-684, ","In May 2011, the illegal use of the phthalate plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate in clouding agents for use in foods and beverages was reported in Taiwan. This food scandal has caused shock and panic among the majority of Taiwanese people and has attracted international attention. Phthalate exposure is assessed by ambient monitoring or human biomonitoring. Ambient monitoring relies on measuring chemicals in environmental media, foodstuff and consumer products. Human biomonitoring determines body burden by measuring the chemicals, their metabolites or specific reaction products in human specimens. In mammalian development, the fetus is set to develop into a female. Because the female phenotype is the default, impairment of testosterone production or action before the late phase may lead to feminizing characteristics. Phthalates disrupt the development of androgen-dependent structures by inhibiting fetal testicular testosterone biosynthesis. The spectrum of effects obtained following perinatal exposure of male rats to phthalates has remarkable similarities with the human testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Epidemiological studies have suggested associations between phthalate exposure and shorter gestational age, shorter anogenital distance, shorter penis, incomplete testicular descent, sex hormone alteration, precocious puberty, pubertal gynecomastia, premature thelarche, rhinitis, eczema, asthma, low birth weight, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, low intelligence quotient, thyroid hormone alteration, and hypospadias in infants and children. Furthermore, many studies have suggested associations between phthalate exposure and increased sperm DNA damage, decreased proportion of sperm with normal morphology, decreased sperm concentration, decreased sperm morphology, sex hormone alteration, decreased pulmonary function, endometriosis, uterine leiomyomas, breast cancer, obesity, hyperprolactinemia, and thyroid hormone alteration in adults. Finally, the number of phthalate-related scientific publications from Taiwan has increased greatly over the past 5 years, which may reflect the health effects from the illegal addition of phthalate plasticizer to clouding agent in foodstuff over the past two decades."

Turcotte, ","Hepatology, Volume 21, Issue 2, February 1995, Pages 366-372, ","A double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intravenous prostaglandin PGE1 (40 米g/h) was conducted in adult orthotopic liver transplant recipients. Infusion was started intraoperatively and continued for up to 21 days. Patients were followed up for 180 days postoperatively. Among 172 patients eligible for treatment in the study, 160 could be evaluated (78 PGE1; 82 placebo). Patient and graft survival were similar (PGE1: 16 deaths, 9 retransplantations [7 survivors]; controls: 15 deaths, 6 retransplantations [3 survivors]). In patients with surviving grafts, however, PGE1 administration resulted in a 23% shorter mean duration of hospitalization following transplantation (PGE1: 24.4 days; controls: 31.8 days; P = .02) and a 40% shorter length of time postoperatively in the intensive care unit (PGE1: 8.2 days; controls 13.7 days; P = .05). Reduced needs for renal support (P = .03) or surgical intervention other than retransplantation (P = .02) were also noted with PGE1 use. Further, PGE1 administration resulted in a trend toward improved survival rates in patients with mild renal impairment (preoperative serum creatinine 1.5 mg percent or greater; P = .08). Neither the incidence of acute cellular rejection nor of primary nonfunction was significantly different in the two groups. Phlebitis was the only complication that was more common during PGE1 administration, (PGE1: 9; controls: 4). These results suggest that PGE1 use in hepatic allograft recipients reduces morbidity and may result in sizable cost reductions."

+Query and Update Efficient B-Tree Based Indexing of Moving Objects,"Christian S. Jensen, Dan Lin, Beng Chin Ooi, ","Proceedings 2004 VLDB Conference, 2004, Pages 768-779, ","A number of emerging applications of data management technology involve the monitoring and querying of large quantities of continuous variables〞the positions of mobile service users, termed moving objects. In such applications, large quantities of state samples obtained via sensors are streamed to a database. Indexes for moving objects must support queries efficiently, but must also support frequent updates. Indexes based on minimum bounding regions (MBRs) such as the R-tree exhibit high concurrency overheads during node splitting, and each individual update is known to be quite costly that has led to the design of a solution that enables the B+-tree to manage moving objects. This chapter presents moving-object locations as vectors that are time-stamped based on their update time. By applying a novel linearization technique to these values, it is possible to index the resulting values using a single B+-tree that partitions values according to their timestamp and otherwise preserves spatial proximity."

Chemoprevention of benzo(a)pyrene-induced colon polyps in ApcMin mice by resveratrol,"Ashley C. Huderson, Jeremy N. Myers, Mohammad S. Niaz, Mary K. Washington, Aramandla Ramesh, ","The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, Volume 24, Issue 4, April 2013, Pages 713-724, ","Human dietary exposure to benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) has generated interest with regard to the association of BaP with gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. Since colon cancer ranks third among cancer-related mortalities, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of phytochemicals on colon cancer initiation and progression. In this study, we investigated the preventive effects of resveratrol (RVT) on BaP-induced colon carcinogenesis in ApcMin mouse model. For the first group of mice, 100 米g BaP/kg body weight was administered to mice in peanut oil via oral gavage over a 60-day period. For the second group, RVT was coadministered with BaP at a dose of 45 米g/kg. For the third group, RVT was administered for 1 week prior to BaP exposure for 60 days. Jejunum, colon and liver were collected at 60 days post BaP and RVT exposure; adenomas in jejunum and colon were counted and subjected to histopathology. RVT reduced the number of colon adenomas in BaP+RVT-treated mice significantly compared to that in mice that received BaP alone. While dysplasia of varying degrees was noted in colon of BaP-treated mice, the dysplasias were of limited occurrence in RVT-treated mice. To ascertain whether the tumor inhibition is a result of altered BaP-induced toxicity of tumor cells, growth, apoptosis and proliferation of adenocarcinoma cells were assessed posttreatment with RVT and BaP. Cotreatment with RVT increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation to a greater extent than with BaP alone. Overall, our observations reveal that RVT inhibits colon tumorigenesis when given together with BaP and holds promise as a therapeutic agent."
Anti-death properties of TNF against metabolic poisoning: mitochondrial stabilization by MnSOD,"Annadora J Bruce-Keller, James W Geddes, Pamela E Knapp, Robert W McFall, Mark P Mattson, ","Journal of Neuroimmunology, Volume 93, Issues 1每2, 1 January 1999, Pages 53-71, ","The cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is toxic to some mitotic cells, but protects cultured neurons from a variety of insults by mechanisms that are unclear. Pretreatment of neurons or astrocytes with TNF caused significant increases in MnSOD activity, and also significantly attenuated 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) induced superoxide accumulation and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. In oligodendrocytes, however, MnSOD activity was not increased, and 3-NP toxicity was unaffected by TNF. Genetically engineered PC6 cells that overexpress MnSOD also were resistant to 3-NP-induced damage. TNF pretreatment and MnSOD overexpression prevented 3-NP induced apoptosis, and shifted the mode of death from necrosis to apoptosis in response to high levels of 3-NP. Mitochondria isolated from either MnSOD overexpressing PC6 cells or TNF-treated neurons maintained resistance to 3-NP-induced loss of transmembrane potential and calcium homeostasis, and showed attenuated release of caspase activators. Overall, these results indicate that MnSOD activity directly stabilizes mitochondrial transmembrane potential and calcium buffering ability, thereby increasing the threshold for lethal injury. Additional studies showed that levels of oxidative stress and striatal lesion size following 3-NP administration in vivo are increased in mice lacking TNF receptors."
Infinite dilution partial molar properties of aqueous solutions of nonelectrolytes. I.

O＊Connell, Robert H. Wood, ","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, Volume 64, Issue 3, February 2000, Pages 495-512, ",A semitheoretical expression for partial molar volumes at infinite dilution of aqueous nonelectrolyte solutes has been developed employing the collection of properties from fluctuation solution theory for use over wide ranges of temperature and pressure. The form of the solution expression was suggested by a comparison of solute/solvent and solvent/solvent direct correlation function integrals (DCFI). The selection of solvent density and compressibility as model variables provides a correct description in the critical region while second virial coefficients have been used to give a rigorous expression in the low density region. The formulation has been integrated to obtain analytic expressions for thermodynamic properties of hydration at supercritical temperatures. The equation is limited to solutes for which B12 (the second cross virial coefficient between water and a solute molecule) is known or can be estimated. Regression of the three remaining parameters gives good correlations of the available experimental data. A strategy for estimating these parameters allows prediction from readily available data.

Thus, the present LB model is independent on any structure statistical parameters of the porous media, which is contrary to the numerical methods assuming the porous media is homogeneous. Compared with existing LB models for multi-component flow in the SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) anode, the present LB model is capable of simulating mixture flow with larger ratios of molecular weights, thus it is qualified to meet the fuel flexibility of the SOFC. By using this model, the mass transfer of gaseous mixture flow in a SOFC anode is studied and the local molar fraction distributions of gaseous mixture are obtained within the irregular porous anode directly. The influences of anode microstructure, dimensionless reaction flux and fuel composition on anode performance are investigated. The quantitative relationship between the porous microstructure and anode performance is obtained."
Handaxes in South Africa: Two case studies in the early and later Acheulean,"Hao Li, Kathleen Kuman, George M. Leader, Raymond Couzens, ","Quaternary International, Volume 480, 30 June 2018, Pages 29-42, ","As a characteristic component of the Acheulean Complex that is particularly significant in understanding the technological behaviour of early hominids, handaxes have been extensively discussed for a very long time. However, the fundamental question of temporal trends in handaxe technology is still debated in current research. To contribute to the further understanding of this question, we present a quantitative study of the technology and morphology of handaxes from two sites widely separated in time〞the Rietputs 15 earlier Acheulean ca 1.3 Ma, and the Cave of Hearths later Acheulean ca 0.5 Ma. Results show that the technological practice of handaxe manufacture is consistent and conservative through time in these two sites, despite significant differences in raw materials. These commonalities include the ability to detach large flakes, to shape many handaxes with bifacial flaking, and to apply both primary and secondary flaking in shaping and edge refinement. However, there is an increased investment in the time and energy devoted to flaking of the younger Acheulean handaxe sample. Temporal differences in the morphology of handaxes between the two assemblages are not shown in most metrical attributes and indices used in this study. In contrast, extensive variability is observed at the intra-assemblage level in both samples, with Cave of Hearths showing relatively more variability. We argue that the conservatism and variability shown in the handaxes from these two sites widely separated in time are a reflection of the shared and long-lasting success of the Acheulean technological tradition and its flexibility of adaptation to different subsistence niches."

Lack of sufficient pain knowledge associated with inadequate pain management has been proved. However, the intention, defined as the predictor of behavior, regarding pain management remains unknown. Therefore, the study was to determine the attitude and intention regarding pain management among Chinese nursing students and investigate the underlying determinants and their interactions in terms of intention toward pain management. The Pain Management Survey Questionnaire, comprising the key determinants of the theory of planned behavior〞that is, direct attitude, belief-based intention, subjective norm, direct control, and indirect control〞was used to collect data from 512 nursing students who undertook clinical rotation in an affiliated hospital of a medical college in China. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent sample t test, Pearson correlation analysis, or structural equation modeling analysis. Chinese nursing students reported negative attitudes and behavioral intentions toward pain management. Direct control, subjective norm, belief-based attitude, and indirect control independently predicted nursing students' intention to treat patients with pain. Direct control was the strongest predictor. Structural equation modeling analysis further revealed 39.84% of the variance associated with intention that could be explained by determinants of the theory of planned behavior. Additionally, educational school level and previous pain management training had great effects on pain management intention. Overall, this study identified intention as an important factor in effective pain treatment. Chinese nursing students have negative attitudes and insufficient intention to pain management. Therefore, hospitals and universities in China should manage these factors to improve nursing students＊ practice regarding pain management."
Fruiting failure and limited recruitment in remnant populations of the hawkmoth-pollinated tree Oxyanthus pyriformis subsp. pyriformis (Rubiaceae),"Steven D. Johnson, Paul R. Neal, Craig I. Peter, Trevor J. Edwards, ","Biological Conservation, Volume 120, Issue 1, November 2004, Pages 31-39, ","Plants with highly specialized pollination systems may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of habitat fragmentation. The sub-canopy tree Oxyanthus pyriformis subsp. pyriformis has deep tubular flowers (c. 90 mm in length) that are specialized for pollination by long-tongued hawkmoths. Existing natural populations of this taxon appear to be confined to two suburban habitat fragments in the city of Durban, South Africa. Breeding system experiments showed that the trees are self-incompatible and thus completely reliant on pollen vectors for sexual reproduction. Hawkmoths were rarely observed to visit flowers, despite intensive monitoring over four seasons from 1997 to 2003. Fruit set as determined from examination of more than 150,000 flowers at the two sites was extremely low (0.04% and 0.07% of flowers), but increased to more than 70% in flowers that were hand-pollinated with pollen from another tree. This >1000-fold increase in the likelihood of fruit production following pollen-supplementation indicates that trees experience severe pollen-limitation of fruit set. Natural fruit set is so low that only a few dozen fruits were recorded in each population during two years of monitoring. This is of concern as O. pyriformis trees are dependent solely on seeds for recruitment. Demographic surveys showed that remaining natural populations have fewer saplings than adult trees and only two seedlings for every adult tree. The long-term viability of reintroduced populations of O. pyriformis is also in doubt, as we observed an almost complete lack of recruitment in a population that was established in a seemingly suitable forest site 20 years ago. Regular hand-pollination and, in some instances, further planting of saplings, may be the only way to safeguard these populations."

Expression and purification of recombinant antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis for application in serodiagnosis,"Abhishek Kulshrestha, Amita Gupta, Nitin Verma, S. K. Sharma, Vijay K. Chaudhary, ","Protein Expression and Purification, Volume 44, Issue 1, November 2005, Pages 75-85, ","Accurate diagnosis is essential for the treatment, prevention, and control of tuberculosis. Poor specificity of the tuberculin skin test in BCG-vaccinated populations and constraints to implementation of PCR and CMI-based diagnostic assays in developing countries warrant development of easy-to perform robust serological tests. Due to great heterogeneity in humoral response in TB patients, it will be necessary to include several antigens in any diagnostic assay to achieve useful levels of sensitivity and specificity. This needs production of recombinants, soluble versions of mycobacterial antigens in high yields. We have cloned, expressed, and purified a number of mycobacterial proteins in Escherichia coli. This paper describes the expression and purification of four promising sero-reactive proteins namely, ESAT6, CFP10, MTC28, and 14-kDa antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The protocol involves regulated and slow expression of proteins by using a T7 promoter-based expression vector for obtaining soluble protein followed by a three-step column chromatography procedure employing media with high binding capacity and flow characteristics. The yields of these proteins obtained were several folds higher than previously reported. The purified proteins were useful in detecting antibodies in sera of TB patients (smear positive, smear negative, and extra-pulmonary categories) and in combination with other immunodominant antigens will be useful in increasing the sensitivity to detect M. tuberculosis specific antibodies."
Group contribution equation of state based on a concentric shell intermolecular potential model,"Robert P. Currier, John P. O'Connell, ","Fluid Phase Equilibria, Volume 57, Issues 1每2, 1990, Pages 67-87, ","A statistical mechanical model for site-site interactions distributed on concentric spherical shells is developed and initial calculations for pure fluids are made via a generalized mean-field framework. Tests are made to estimate accuracy, check consistency and evaluate parameter sensitivity and transferability. The general success of the results for model and real fluids suggests that the concept may be a fruitful alternative to present group contribution equations of state since it can include differences in molecular structure and non-conformal site-site interactions."

Translational research will fail without surgical leadership: SCOTRRCC a successful surgeon-led Nationwide translational research infrastructure in renal cancer,"Grant D. Stewart, Antony C. P. Riddick, Frances Rae, Craig Marshall, David J. Harrison, ","The Surgeon, Volume 13, Issue 4, August 2015, Pages 181-186, ","High quality human biosamples with associated high quality clinical data are essential for successful translational research. Despite this, the traditional approach is for the surgeon to act as a technician in the tissue collection act. Biomarker research presents multiple challenges and the field is littered with failures. Tissue quality, poor clinical information, small sample numbers and lack of validation cohorts are just a few reasons for failure. It is clear that the surgeon involved in tissue acquisition must be fully engaged in the process of biosampling for a specific condition, as this will negate many of the issues for translational research failure due to an inadequate bioresource.In this Matter for Debate paper, the Scottish Collaboration On Translational Research into Renal Cell Cancer (SCOTRRCC) is discussed as an example of a urological surgery lead bioresource which has resulted in a National collection of renal cancer tissue and blood (from over 900 patients to date), negating all of the traditional issues with biobanks because of close enagagement and acknowledgement of urologists and uropathologists from seven centres around Scotland. SCOTRRCC has leveraged renal cancer research in Scotland resulting in several high impact publications and providing a springboard for future research in this disease in Scotland and beyond.The SCOTRRCC model presented here can be transferred to other surgical disciplines for success in translational research."
Recombinational DNA repair and human disease,"Larry H Thompson, David Schild, ","Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis, Volume 509, Issues 1每2, 30 November 2002, Pages 49-78, ","We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Bloom syndrome involves a defect in the BLM helicase, which seems to play a role in restarting DNA replication forks that are blocked at lesions, thereby promoting chromosome stability. The Werner syndrome gene (WRN) helicase, another member of the RecQ family like BLM, has very recently been found to help mediate homologous recombination. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically complex chromosomal instability disorder involving seven or more genes, one of which is BRCA2. FA may be at least partially caused by the aberrant production of reactive oxidative species. The breast cancer-associated BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are strongly implicated in HRR; BRCA2 associates with Rad51 and appears to regulate its activity. We discuss in detail the phenotypes of the various mutant cell lines and the signaling pathways mediated by the ATM kinase. ATM＊s phosphorylation targets can be grouped into oxidative stress-mediated transcriptional changes, cell cycle checkpoints, and recombinational repair. We present the DNA damage response pathways by using the DSB as the prototype lesion, whose incorrect repair can initiate and augment karyotypic abnormalities."
Machine learning predictive framework for CO2 thermodynamic properties in solution,"Zhien Zhang, Hao Li, Haixing Chang, Zhen Pan, Xubiao Luo, ","Journal of CO2 Utilization, Volume 26, July 2018, Pages 152-159, ","CO2 is the major greenhouse gas (GHG) emission throughout the world. For scientific and industrial purposes, chemical absorption is regarded as an efficient method to capture CO2. However, the observation of thermodynamic properties of CO2 in solution environment requires too much time and resources. To address this issue and provide an ultra-fast solution, here, we use machine learning as a powerful data-mining strategy to predict the CO2 solubility, density and viscosity of potassium lysinate (PL) and its blended solutions with monoethanolamine (MEA), with totally 433 data groups extracted from previous experimental literatures. Specifically, we compared the predictive performances of back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and general regression neural network (GRNN). Results show that for BPNN with only one hidden layer and a small number of hidden neurons could provide good predictive performance for CO2 solubility and aqueous solution viscosity, while a GRNN could perform better for the prediction of aqueous solution density. Finally, it is concluded that such a machine learning based predictive framework could help to provide an ultra-fast prediction for CO2-related thermodynamic properties in solution environment.Download high-res image (113KB)Download full-size image"
Transmission property of one-dimensional multilayer graphene每dielectric stack,"Liwei Zhang, Guodong Wang, Xu Han, Yuhuan Zhao, ","Optik - International Journal for Light and Electron Optics, Volume 127, Issue 4, February 2016, Pages 2030-2035, ","The transmission property and field distribution of one-dimensional multilayer containing graphene sheets separated by dielectric slabs are theoretically studied in terahertz. It is shown that the multilayer graphene每dielectric stack supports a series of passband and stopband whose number increases with the dielectric thickness. The field distributions show that the transmission resonances in the passband are attributed to Fabry每Perot resonances in the dielectric layer and the node numbers that appear in the field distribution in each graphene每dielectric每graphene cavity can be quantitatively given. It is also noticed that these resonances lie within a certain characteristic frequency bands which are independent of the number of unit cells making up the structure. The low frequency edge of the passband is highly tunable by the Fermi energy and the layer number of graphene sheets, while the high frequency edge is just determined by the dielectric slab. When an impurity is introduced, a defect mode can appear inside the stopband and it can be adjusted by Fermi energy of graphene controlled via a gate voltage."
Meta-Analysis of Genome-wide Association Studies with Overlapping Subjects,"Dan-Yu Lin, Patrick F. Sullivan, ","The American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 85, Issue 6, 11 December 2009, Pages 862-872, ","Data from multiple genome-wide association studies are often analyzed together for the purposes of combining information from several studies of the same disease or comparing results across different disorders. We provide a valid and efficient approach to such meta-analysis, allowing for overlapping study subjects. The available data may contain individual participant records or only meta-analytic summary results. Simulation studies demonstrate that failure to account for overlapping subjects can greatly inflate type I error when combining results from multiple studies of the same disease and can drastically reduce power when comparing results across different disorders. In addition, the proposed approach can be substantially more powerful than the simple approach of splitting the overlapping subjects among studies, especially for comparing results across different disorders. The advantages of the new approach are illustrated with empirical data from two sets of genome-wide association studies."
"PR-957, a selective immunoproteasome inhibitor, reactivates latent HIV-1 through p-TEFb activation mediated by HSF-1","Jian Lin, Xuanxuan Zhang, Wanzhen Lu, Xinfeng Xu, Shuwen Liu, ","Biochemical Pharmacology, In press, accepted manuscript, Available online 29 August 2018, ","The existence of latent reservoirs of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type-1 (HIV-1) is a major obstacle in eliminating the virus. Thus, an urgent need exists for effective latency reversing agents (LRAs) based on the ※shock and kill§ strategy. Proteasome inhibitors were recently studied as LRAs, but were considered too toxic for clinical use. Here, we demonstrated that PR-957, a selective immunoproteasome inhibitor, effectively reactivated latent HIV-1 provirus in vitro and ex vivo. Our data also suggests that PR-957 has relatively low cytotoxicity. Furthermore, it does not influence global T cell activation and decreases the expression levels of HIV-1 receptors/co-receptors. We demonstrated synergistic activation of latent HIV-1 with PR-957 and Prostratin (a protein kinase C activator) that alleviated the extent of T cell activation induced by Prostratin. In addition, PR-957 exhibited latency reversing efficacy through activating p-TEFb mediated by HSF-1 pathway. Moreover, PR-957 did not affect the activity of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) drugs and the PR-957-reactivated virus was effectively inhibited with cART drugs. In conclusion, the immunoproteasome inhibitor PR-957 is a promising candidate LRA for future HIV-1 eradication strategies.Download high-res image (44KB)Download full-size image"
Breathers on diatomic Fermi每Pasta每Ulam lattices,"Guillaume James, Pascal Noble, ","Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, Volume 196, Issues 1每2, 1 September 2004, Pages 124-171, ","We prove the existence of breathers (spatially localized and time-periodic oscillations) in diatomic Fermi每Pasta每Ulam (FPU) chains with arbitrary mass ratio. This completes an existence result by Livi, Spicci and MacKay valid for large mass ratio. The problem is formulated as a mapping in a loop space and analyzed via a discrete spatial centre manifold reduction. Plane wave solutions of the linearized system have frequencies in a higher ※optic§ band or a lower ※acoustic§ band. For frequencies close to band edges, all small amplitude solutions of the nonlinear system lie on a finite-dimensional centre manifold, which reduces the problem locally to the study of a finite-dimensional mapping. For good parameter values, the map admits homoclinic orbits to 0 corresponding to discrete breathers. When the FPU interaction potential satisfies a hardening condition, we find breathers with frequencies slightly above the optic band, or in the gap slightly above the acoustic band. For a potential satisfying the opposite softening condition, we obtain breathers with frequencies in the gap slightly below the optic band."

However, the difficulty of data processing has been in the way of health monitoring of civil structures and hence an obstacle against BOTDR＊s development. In order to realize the rapid processing of distributed strain data, the strain measurement line was divided into a series of waveform units to confirm whether waveform units are normal or not by pattern recognition while taking both mean and standard deviation of characteristic vector into consideration, as well as combine neighboring abnormal units as abnormal area and give evaluation and warning to this area by the correspondence between waveforms and fiber deformation. The application of data processing in distributed monitoring of a certain tunnel showed that the abnormal area can be located fast and accurately and the deformation of optical fiber and structure can be evaluated with this technology."
Does outward FDI generate higher productivity for emerging economy MNEs? 每 Micro-level evidence from Chinese manufacturing firms,"Linjie Li, Xiaming Liu, Dong Yuan, Miaojie Yu, ","International Business Review, Volume 26, Issue 5, October 2017, Pages 839-854, ","This paper investigates whether emerging economy multinational enterprises (EMEs) that undertake outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) become more productive, controlling for the self-selection into the global investment market. Particularly, we focus on the moderating effects of firm heterogeneity on the OFDI-productivity nexus. A theoretical framework incorporating the resource-based views and institutional theory is established and the propensity-score matching and difference-in-difference (DID) approaches are combined to test the framework, utilizing unique data on Chinese manufacturing firms over the sample period 2002每2008. We find that EMEs turn to be generally more productive after they conduct OFDI, but this productivity effect varies depending on the parent firm and investment strategy heterogeneity. Our results suggest that EMEs without state ownership but with stronger absorptive capability gain higher and more sustainable productivity effects and such gains are higher for EMEs investing in OECD than in non-OECD countries. Policy and managerial implications are discussed."
Role of the retinal vascular endothelial cell in ocular disease,"Arpita S. Bharadwaj, Binoy Appukuttan, Phillip A. Wilmarth, Yuzhen Pan, Justine R. Smith, ","Progress in Retinal and Eye Research, Volume 32, January 2013, Pages 102-180, ","Retinal endothelial cells line the arborizing microvasculature that supplies and drains the neural retina. The anatomical and physiological characteristics of these endothelial cells are consistent with nutritional requirements and protection of a tissue critical to vision. On the one hand, the endothelium must ensure the supply of oxygen and other nutrients to the metabolically active retina, and allow access to circulating cells that maintain the vasculature or survey the retina for the presence of potential pathogens. On the other hand, the endothelium contributes to the blood-retinal barrier that protects the retina by excluding circulating molecular toxins, microorganisms, and pro-inflammatory leukocytes. Features required to fulfill these functions may also predispose to disease processes, such as retinal vascular leakage and neovascularization, and trafficking of microbes and inflammatory cells. Thus, the retinal endothelial cell is a key participant in retinal ischemic vasculopathies that include diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, and retinal inflammation or infection, as occurs in posterior uveitis. Using gene expression and proteomic profiling, it has been possible to explore the molecular phenotype of the human retinal endothelial cell and contribute to understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases. In addition to providing support for the involvement of well-characterized endothelial molecules, profiling has the power to identify new players in retinal pathologies. Findings may have implications for the design of new biological therapies. Additional progress in this field is anticipated as other technologies, including epigenetic profiling methods, whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing, and metabolomics, are used to study the human retinal endothelial cell."

The effects of pH and salt electrolyte on the morphology of the self-assembled polymer composites were investigated. The resulting heterocoagulates were highly stable in water and acid solution. These heterocoagulates were reversible through the self-assembly in acidic or neutral media and the dissociation in the basic medium due to the charge compensation through the strong affinity complex between hydroxide anion and pyridinium group cation. The resulting heterocoagulates were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). As a result, a new method for tuning the structure of a charge compensation directed polymer composite was developed."

A dynamic input每output method for energy system modeling and analysis,"Lingying Pan, Pei Liu, Zheng Li, Yonglian Wang, ","Chemical Engineering Research and Design, Volume 131, March 2018, Pages 183-192, ","This paper proposes a dynamic input每output model, in order to present the interaction mechanism between energy supply and demand, and provide optimal design for energy supply每consumption system. Combined with mixed integer programming, the model is able to provide optimal technology development route for the energy supply每consumption system. In this model, the generational change and replacement of energy supply facilities are considered. Based on the model, a case study of China is employed. Three scenarios are designed to compare the different outcome of the model. The optimal objectives of Scenario 1 are Pareto Optimality of minimum total energy consumption and minimum total CO2 emission. The optimal objective of Scenario 2 is minimum CO2 emission. The optimal objective of Scenario 3 is minimum energy consumption. Scenario 1 leads to a balancing design of multiple objectives, and the results indicate that energy conservation and CO2 emission reduction targets can be achieved simultaneously. Compared with the optimal design with single objective of Scenarios 2 and 3, the balancing design with multiple objectives performs better in avoiding over-capacity problems during the modeling period. With well-designed development route, energy intensity can be reduced by about 58%每60%, and CO2 emission intensity can be reduced by about 34%每36% from 2012 to 2040. The optimal objectives of the model also influence the development of energy demand structure. The modeling results of transport sector are presented as an example in this paper. To achieve the targets of energy conservation and CO2 emission reduction, both the development routes for energy supply and demand should be well-designed."
Observer variability in the histopathological reporting of needle biopsy specimens of the prostate,"Alastair M Lessells, Rodney A Burnett, S.

In the current study, consisting of 100 needle biopsy specimens of the prostate, a single hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) slide from each case was circulated in batches of 10 to the 12 pathologists, who filled in a simple proforma. This had two sections: a diagnostic category (benign; suspicious or malignant) along with a standard Gleason score for those regarded as malignant. The majority diagnosis of the 100 cases was benign, 53; suspicious, 1; and malignant, 46. The Kappa value for benign cases versus others was 0.86 and for malignant cases versus others was 0.91. Analysis of the data on Gleason scores showed a value of 0.54 when cases were divided into two categories (2 to 6 v 7 to 10) and 0.41 when three categories were used (2 to 4; 5 to 6; 7 to 10). Although not initially part of the design of the study, the majority diagnosis was compared with the original reported diagnosis. In a small subset, examination of further levels, basal cell antibody staining, along with further clinical information, was obtained. With this added information, it appears that there were probably 52 benign and 48 malignant cases. Of the 48 malignant cases, the group majority diagnosis was malignant, 46; suspicious, 1; and benign, l. The original reported diagnosis was 56 benign, 1 suspicious, and 43 malignant. The group therefore appeared to perform better than the original reporting pathologists. When compared with the results of our previous studies, this study has shown that the diagnosis of carcinoma of the prostate on a needle biopsy is robust."

The main advantage of D-Norm lies in that it does not need any additional speech data or external speaker population, as opposed to the other state-of-the-art score normalization approaches. But still, it has some drawbacks, e.g., the Monte-Carlo based Kullback-Leibler distance estimation approach in the conventional D-Norm approach is a time consuming and computation costly task. In this paper, D-Norm was investigated and its principles were explored from a perspective different from the original one. In addition, this paper also proposed a simplified approach to perform D-Norm, which used the upper bound of the KL divergence between two statistical speaker models as the measure of model distance. Experiments on NIST 2006 SRE corpus showed that the simplified approach of D-Norm achieves similar system performance as the conventional one while the computational complexity is greatly reduced."
Structural damage detection-oriented multi-type sensor placement with multi-objective optimization,"Jian-Fu Lin, You-Lin Xu, Siu-Seong Law, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, Volume 422, 26 May 2018, Pages 568-589, ","A structural damage detection-oriented multi-type sensor placement method with multi-objective optimization is developed in this study. The multi-type response covariance sensitivity-based damage detection method is first introduced. Two objective functions for optimal sensor placement are then introduced in terms of the response covariance sensitivity and the response independence. The multi-objective optimization problem is formed by using the two objective functions, and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-II is adopted to find the solution for the optimal multi-type sensor placement to achieve the best structural damage detection. The proposed method is finally applied to a nine-bay three-dimensional frame structure. Numerical results show that the optimal multi-type sensor placement determined by the proposed method can avoid redundant sensors and provide satisfactory results for structural damage detection. The restriction on the number of each type of sensors in the optimization can reduce the searching space in the optimization to make the proposed method more effective. Moreover, how to select a most optimal sensor placement from the Pareto solutions via the utility function and the knee point method is demonstrated in the case study."
Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in human umbilical vein endothelial cells during primary culture,"Maria Cristina de Assis, Maria Cristina Plotkowski, Iolanda M Fierro, Christina Barja-Fidalgo, Marta S de Freitas, ","Nitric Oxide, Volume 7, Issue 4, December 2002, Pages 254-261, ","The adaptive response of endothelial cells to stress may lead to the upregulation of nitric oxide (NO) production. Herein, we report inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induction in primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The enzyme expression was earlier observed in 12-h cultures, reaching maximal levels after 3 days and decreasing when cells become confluent. The time course of NO production by HUVEC paralleled iNOS expression during the whole culture period, indicating that enzyme was functionally active. Conversely, iNOS induction could not be further detected in HUVEC subcultures passed once from cells presenting maximal levels of iNOS expression in the primary culture. Induction of iNOS in HUVEC was not related to lipopolysaccharide contamination, since the enzyme expression was not affected in the presence of polymyxin B added to primary cultures. Further analysis showed that aminoguanidine, a specific iNOS inhibitor, did not affect cell proliferation, suggesting that the NO produced by HUVEC may not be directly related to cell growth. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 expression was upregulated during cell confluence, in contrast to the decrease of iNOS expression and activity. The data suggest that iNOS expression may be a molecular mechanism mediating the adaptive response of endothelial cells to culture environment."

For producing a highly specific diagnostic test, it is important that the recombinant antigens be highly pure, free of host protein, and correctly folded so that they bind only to specific antibodies. Also, for commercial viability they need to be produced in high yields. We have cloned, expressed, and purified a number of mycobacterial antigens in Escherichia coli. This paper describes, expression and purification of two important mycobacterial proteins with serodiagnostic potential, namely, 38-kDa and Mtb81 antigens, in monomeric form. The protocol involves using a T7 promoter based expression vector under conditions of regulated and slow expression followed by three-step column chromatography procedure to obtain highly purified proteins. The yields of the two proteins were several folds higher than previously reported. The purified proteins were useful in detecting antibodies in sera of tuberculosis patients (smear positive, smear negative, and extra-pulmonary categories)."

Patients receiving irinotecan or oxaliplatin were more likely to develop bone metastases (13.2% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.01 for irinotecan; 16.9% vs. 9%, P = 0.003 for oxaliplatin). Patients with primary rectal versus primary colon cancer were more likely to develop bone metastases (16% vs. 8.6%; P = 0.001). Patients with lung metastases were more likely to have bone metastases (16.1% vs. 6.4%; P < 0.0001) or brain metastases (6.2% vs. 1.2%; P < 0.0001) than those without.These data demonstrate that the incidence of bone and brain metastases in patients with CRC is more common than previously reported and is associated with receipt of multiple systemic treatments. As survival improves for this patient population, clinicians should be aware of the potential for metastases at previously uncommon sites."

Multiscale concurrent topology optimization for cellular structures with multiple microstructures based on ordered SIMP interpolation,"Yan Zhang, Mi Xiao, Hao Li, Liang Gao, Sheng Chu, ","Computational Materials Science, Volume 155, December 2018, Pages 74-91, ","This paper presents a novel multiscale concurrent topology optimization method for cellular structures with various types of microstructures to obtain a superior structural performance at an affordable computation cost. At macroscale, different microstructures are regarded as different materials in a multi-material topology optimization. An ordered solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) interpolation model, which is efficient for solving multi-material topology optimization problems without introducing any new variables, is employed to generate an overall structure layout with predetermined multiple materials. At microscale, each macroscale element is viewed as an individual microstructure. All macroscale elements with the same material are represented by a unique microstructure. A parametric level set method (PLSM) is applied to evolve the shape and topology of the representative microstructures, whose effective properties are evaluated by a numerical homogenization method. The connectivity of adjacent microstructures is guaranteed by a kinematical connective constraint. Using the proposed method, the macrostructural topology as well as the locations and configurations of microstructures can be simultaneously optimized. Numerical examples are provided to test the effectiveness of the proposed method.Download high-res image (242KB)Download full-size image"
Is there an inverse U-shaped relationship between pay and performance?,"Hsien-Chang Kuo, Dan Lin, Donald Lien, Lie-Huey Wang, Li-Jen Yeh, ","The North American Journal of Economics and Finance, Volume 28, April 2014, Pages 347-357, ","Given the increasing concerns about the escalation in executive compensation, this study aims to provide new insights into the link between executive pay and firm performance by empirically testing for an inverse U-shaped relationship.

The finding provides support for both optimal contracting and managerial power theories with the former dominating at low level of firm performance and the latter dominating at high level of firm performance."

Constitutive analysis and optimization on hot working parameters of as-cast high Cr ultra-super-critical rotor steel with columnar grains,"Zong-ye Ding, Di Zhang, Qiao-dan Hu, Long Zeng, Jian-guo Li, ","Journal of Iron and Steel Research, International, Volume 24, Issue 9, September 2017, Pages 916-924, ","Isothermal hot compression tests on the as-cast high-Cr ultra-super-critical rotor steel with columnar grains were carried out in the temperature range from 1223 to 1523 K and at strain rates from 0.001 to 1 s每1. The compression direction was parallel to the longitudinal direction of columnar grains. The constitutive equation based on Arrhenius model was presented, and the processing maps based on the dynamic material model were developed, correlating with microstructure observation. The main softening mechanism was dynamic recovery at 1223 K under strain rates from 0.1 to 1 s每1, whereas it was dynamic recrystallization under other deformation conditions. The constitutive equation modified by strain compensation reasonably predicted the flow stresses. The processing maps and microstructure evolution mechanism schematic indicated that the optimum hot working parameters lay in the zone defined by the temperature range from 1423 to 1473 K and the strain rate range from 0.001 to 1 s每1."
Bond strength and surface characterization of a Ni-Cr-Be alloy,"Ana M. Diaz-Arnold, John C. Keller, James P. Wightman, Vincent D. Williams, ","Dental Materials, Volume 12, Issue 1, January 1996, Pages 58-63, ","Objectives. Since resin composite cements adhere directly to base metal surfaces, the composition and integrity of the surface oxide layer is considered critical for adequate bonding. The aims of this study were to determine the tensile bond strength, and assess predominant surface oxides and oxide layer depth on the surface of a Ni-Cr-Be alloy after subjecting the alloy to various surface treatments.Methods. Cylinders of Ni-Cr-Be (Rexillium III, Jeneric/Pentron) were cast and the following test groups were investigated: Group 0: no furnace oxidation, no air abrasion; Group 1: air fired, starting temperature 650∼C, ending temperature 1000∼C (1 min hold); Group 2: same firing sequence under vacuum; Group 3: same air firing sequence followed by air abrasion with 50 米m Al2O3; Group 4: vacuum fired, air abraded with 50 米m Al2O3; Group 5: air fired, air abraded with 280 米m Al2O3; Group 6: vacuum fired, air abraded with 280 米m Al2O3; Group 7: no furnace oxidation, air abraded with 50 米m Al2O3; and Group 8: no furnace oxidation, air abraded with 280 米m Al2O3. The oxide composition of three cylinders per group was analyzed with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). Twenty cylinders from each group were bonded together with Panavia 21 (Kuraray), stored in water for 30 d, and tensile tested. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Duncan's Multiple-Range test (p=0.05).Results. Furnace oxidation brough Be to the surface and increased the oxide thickness. Air abrasion removed the oxide layer and resulted in surfaces containing significant amounts of Al2O3. Bond strengths for Group 0 were significantly lower than bond strenghts for Groups 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, but not significantly different from bond strengths for Groups 2 and 7 (p<0.05).Significance. Results of this study suggest differences in oxide composition and thickness due to various surface treatments. Furnace oxidation did not significantly affect bond strength and may not be required as a separate step for metal preparation if a resin adhesive is used."
HSF1 deficiency accelerates the transition from pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure through endothelial miR-195a-3p-mediated impairment of cardiac angiogenesis,"Shijun Wang, Jian Wu, Jieyun You, Hongyu Shi, Yunzeng Zou, ","Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology, Volume 118, May 2018, Pages 193-207, ","Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) deficiency aggravates cardiac remodeling under pressure overload. However, the mechanism is still unknown. Here we employed microRNA array analysis of the heart tissue of HSF1-knockout (KO) mice to investigate the potential roles of microRNAs in pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling under HSF-1 deficiency, and the profiles of 478 microRNAs expressed in the heart tissues of adult HSF1-KO mice were determined. We found that the expression of 5 microRNAs was over 2-fold higher expressed in heart tissues of HSF1-KO mice than in those of wild-type (WT) control mice. Of the overexpressed microRNAs, miR-195a-3p had the highest expression level in HSF1-null endothelial cells (ECs). Induction with miR-195a-3p in ECs significantly suppressed CD31 and VEGF, promoted AngII-induced EC apoptosis, and impaired capillary-like tube formation. In vivo, the upregulation of miR-195a-3p accentuated cardiac hypertrophy, increased the expression of 汕-MHC and ANP, and compromised systolic function in mice under pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). By contrast, antagonism of miR-195a-3p had the opposite effect on HSF1-KO mice. Further experiments confirmed that AMPK汐2 was the direct target of miR-195a-3p. AMPK汐2 overexpression rescued the reduction of eNOS and VEGF, and the impairment of angiogenesis that was induced by miR-195a-3p. In addition, upregulation of AMPK汐2 in the myocardium of HSF1-null mice by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery enhanced CD31, eNOS and VEGF, reduced 汕-MHC and ANP, alleviated pressure overload-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and restored cardiac function. Our findings revealed that the upregulation of miR-195a-3p due to HSF1 deficiency impaired cardiac angiogenesis by regulating AMPK汐2/VEGF signaling, which disrupted the coordination between the myocardial blood supply and the adaptive hypertrophic response and accelerated the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure in response to pressure overload."
Dioscin alleviates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through adjusting lipid metabolism via SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway,"Hong Yao, Xufeng Tao, Lina Xu, Yan Qi, Jinyong Peng, ","Pharmacological Research, Volume 131, May 2018, Pages 51-60, ","Dioscin, one natural product, has active effect against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in our previous work. However, the pharmacological data are insufficient and the mechanisms have not been reported. Thus, this study aims to comprehensively investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of dioscin against NAFLD. The primary cultured hepatocytes, AML-12 and HepG-2 cells were treated with palmic acid (PA) after dioscin treatment. The mice and rats were induced by high fat diet to establish the in vivo models of NAFLD. Dioscin obviously alleviated liver lipid accumulation symptoms and improved the levels of serum and hepatic biochemical parameters in vitro and in vivo. Further investigations revealed that dioscin significantly attenuated lipid metabolism via adjusting SIRT1/AMPK signal pathway to regulate the expression levels of SREBP-1c, CPT, FAS, SCD, FoxO1 and ATGL. In addition, suppression of SIRT1 by Nicotinamide or abrogation of AMPK by Compound C eliminated the inhibitory effects of dioscin on lipid metabolism. Therefore, our findings further demonstrated that dioscin markedly prevented NAFLD through adjusting lipid metabolism via SIRT1/AMPK signal pathway, which should be developed as a new candidate for NAFLD.Download high-res image (84KB)Download full-size image"

Noble, Douglas L. Gin, Karl G. Linden, ","Journal of Membrane Science, Volume 543, 1 December 2017, Pages 319-327, ","A thin-film composite, bicontinuous cubic lyotropic liquid crystal polymer (TFC QI) membrane with uniform-size, ionic nanopores was studied for the treatment of hydraulic fracturing flowback water. The TFC QI membrane performance was compared to those of a commercial nanofiltration (NF) membrane (NF270) and a commercial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane (SW30HR) for the filtration of flowback water from the Denver-Julesburg Basin. The permeability, salt rejection, and organic solute rejection for each membrane was evaluated. The results illustrate that the TFC QI membrane maintained its performance to a similar degree as the commercial NF and RO membranes while demonstrating a unique selectivity not observed in the commercial membranes. Specifically, the TFC QI membrane rejected 75% of the salt while recovering 9.6% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 50% of the water. Of particular interest was the recovery of labile DOC, which was assessed through biodegradation experiments. Analysis following biodegradation of the TFC QI membrane permeate demonstrates the membrane's ability to recover labile DOC in a reduced-saline permeate. Improved recovery of labile DOC (increased to 22%) was demonstrated by reducing the pH of the flowback water. Therefore, the selectivity of the TFC QI membrane provides an opportunity to recover resources from hydraulic fracturing flowback.Download high-res image (341KB)Download full-size image"

Electric vehicle development in China: A charging behavior and power sector supply balance analysis,"Zhihao Chen, Linwei Ma, Pei Liu, Zheng Li, ","Chemical Engineering Research and Design, Volume 131, March 2018, Pages 671-685, ","Possession of motor vehicles in China has been rising fast, along with continuous economic growth, social development and improvements in living standards, causing severe energy and environmental stress. To relieve the stress, China is promoting electric vehicles as good alternatives to conventional vehicles. By 2020, the accumulated production and sales of electric vehicles are expected to reach five million. Large-scale connection of electric vehicles to the power grid would inevitably bring challenges to the power sector. In this paper, an electric vehicle and multi-region load-dispatch grid-structure-based (EVMLG) mathematical model is presented, aiming to investigate the interaction between electric vehicles and the power sector. Impacts of charging behaviors are carefully considered. Through case studies, we conclude that (1) the development of electric vehicles will influence regional generation portfolio and operation pattern of the power sector, and increase the utilization of renewables, (2) guided charging can adapt to the power sector, and lead to better economic and environmental benefits, (3) electric vehicles are suitable to be deployed in resource-rich regions, and (4) the development potential of electric vehicles in China is huge from the viewpoint of power supply capacity."

Induction of the Immunoproteasome Subunit Lmp7 Links Proteostasis and Immunity in 汐-Synuclein Aggregation Disorders,"Scott Ugras, Malcolm J. Daniels, Hossein Fazelinia, Neal S. Gould, Harry Ischiropoulos, ","EBioMedicine, Volume 31, May 2018, Pages 307-319, ","Aggregated a-synuclein is a component of Lewy bodies a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Changes in the brain proteome and phosphorylated peptides were quantified upon aggregation of 汐-synuclein in a mouse model. The levels and activity of LMP7, a component of the immunoproteasome, which is linked to proteostasis were increased indicating a potential adaptive response to 汐-synuclein aggregation.Accumulation of aggregated 汐-synuclein into Lewy bodies is thought to contribute to the onset and progression of dopaminergic neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders. Although protein aggregation is associated with perturbation of proteostasis, how 汐-synuclein aggregation affects the brain proteome and signaling remains uncertain. In a mouse model of 汐-synuclein aggregation, 6% of 6215 proteins and 1.6% of 8183 phosphopeptides changed in abundance, indicating conservation of proteostasis and phosphorylation signaling. The proteomic analysis confirmed changes in abundance of proteins that regulate dopamine synthesis and transport, synaptic activity and integrity, and unearthed changes in mRNA binding, processing and protein translation. Phosphorylation signaling changes centered on axonal and synaptic cytoskeletal organization and structural integrity. Proteostatic responses included a significant increase in the levels of Lmp7, a component of the immunoproteasome. Increased Lmp7 levels and activity were also quantified in postmortem human brains with PD and dementia with Lewy bodies. Functionally, the immunoproteasome degrades 汐-synuclein aggregates and generates potentially antigenic peptides. Expression and activity of the immunoproteasome may represent testable targets to induce adaptive responses that maintain proteome integrity and modulate immune responses in protein aggregation disorders."

The full-length Sox11b cDNA was cloned from the ovary of the orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides. This sequence is highly homologous to SOX11 of other species and contained the signature features of mammalian SOX11 homologues, except for the absence of Pro-Glu rich region and presence of two Ser-rich regions. Southern blot analysis suggested that there is likely a single copy of Sox11b gene in the genome of this fish. The mRNA expression of Sox11b was detected in a wide range of tissues except the blood cells, and its expression is especially abundant in the ovary. During embryogenesis and larval development, the mRNA levels of Sox11b were high except at the eyed stage. During 17汐-methyltestosterone (MT)-induced precocious sex change, the mRNA levels of Sox11b in the gonads were decreased significantly. Together, these results indicated that Sox11b may be involved in the oogenesis, embryogenesis, larval development, and sex change of the orange-spotted grouper."

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization and associated image analysis in aspects of nanoisland size, coverage, circularity, and density were performed to investigate the influence of cyclic deposition and anneal (DAA) on the morphology of as-prepared Au nanoisland arrays. This study revealed that, given a fixed amount of Au deposition per cycle, increasing the number of DAA cycles drove Au nanoislands＊ gradual growth that was interpreted with the increase of their size and coverage and decrease of their density and circularity. In addition, given a fixed amount of total Au deposition, dividing the growth process into more cycles was shown to lower the growth rate of Au nanoislands. Moreover, the as-prepared Au nanoisland arrays were demonstrated to be a viable option as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensing platform whose SERS enhancement was found to be highly dependent upon the size of nanoislands."

Experimental Estimation on the Running Time of Gun Tunnel,"Ruiqu Li, Jian Lin, Xing Chen, ","Procedia Engineering, Volume 99, 2015, Pages 1630-1636, ","The gun tunnel is built up due to the shock-tube theory as one of the high-speed ground test facilitiesand is distinguished with the shock tunnels by the design and use of the piston, which is the most important reason that makes the gun tunnel running for a longer time than the relative shock tunnel. The equilibrium piston theory supplies the rationality of the gun tunnel, which assumes that the light piston used in the gun tunnel runs as the same speed as the shock interface between the high and low regions in the shock tube, and the piston mass could be calculated by the pressure and velocity relation in various regions and the energy conservation formula. The piston with more appropriate mass could result in the more steady running state of the gun tunnel and it could be experimentally validated by the curve of the total pressure, which is interpreted by its voltage signal of the pressure transducer. Based on that technique of equilibrium piston design, the running time of the gun tunnel could be estimated."

This is the first reliable fossil record of Chamaecyparis in China and is also the earliest member of Chamaecyparis currently known. The present fossils have been compared with living and some fossil Chamaecyparis species and they differ from them all. Therefore, the Guyang remains are provisionally identified as Chamaecyparis sp. because of the lack of diagnostic leaf cuticular characteristics. The presence of the Guyang fossils suggests that the genus Chamaecyparis might have originated in eastern Asia during the Early Cretaceous. Their discovery also suggests that Chamaecyparis sp. is possibly an ancestral taxon for the genus."

A malnutrition risk assessment of low (1), moderate (2), or high (3) was assigned by a dietitian for each patient. An algorithm for data organization and classification using characteristic metrics for each patient was developed. For each patient, the algorithm characterized the patients' unique profile and built a characteristic metric to identify similar patients who were mapped into a classification. For each patient, the algorithm characterized the patients' classification.The algorithm assigned a malnutrition risk level for different training sizes that were taken from the data. Our method resulted in average errors (distance between the automated score and the real score) of 0.386, 0.3507, 0.3454, 0.34, and 0.2907 for the 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% training sizes, respectively. Our method outperformed the compared method even when our method used a smaller training set than the compared method. In addition, we showed that the laboratory parameters themselves were sufficient for the automated risk prediction and organized the patients into clusters that corresponded to low-, low每moderate-, moderate-, moderate每high-, and high-risk areas. The organization and visualization methods provided a tool for the exploration and navigation of the data points.The problem of rapidly identifying risk and severity of malnutrition is crucial for minimizing medical and surgical complications. These are not easily performed or adequately expedited. We characterized for each patient a unique profile and mapped similar patients into a classification.

Similar damage detection methods focus only on localization giving no quantitative estimation of extent. To improve detection, we propose two predictive circle methods for size estimation. Numerical simulations and experiments were performed for an aluminum plate with a hole. Two PZT configurations of different sizes were designed to excite and detect Lamb waves. From cross-correlation analysis, the damage location and extent can be determined. Results show that the proposed method enables a better quantitative resolution in detection, the size of the inspection area influences the accuracy of damage identification, and the closer is the inspected area to the damage, the more accurate are the results. The method proposed can be developed into a multiple-step detection method for multi-scale analysis with prospective accuracy."

Three major changes were made: (1) cases in which a major depressive episode occurred within the first 2 years of the disturbance were excluded, and given a diagnosis of major depression, chronic type; (2) the early-late onset and primary-secondary subtype distinctions were introduced; and (3) the list of associated depressive symptoms was revised substantially.The associated symptom criteria for dysthymic disorder in DSM-III appear in Table 1. In order to diagnose dysthymic disorder, at least three of this list of 13 associated symptoms were required to be present during the patient's depressive periods. The revised symptom criteria from DSM-III-R appears in Table 2. Several changes are apparent. First, the number of associated symptoms was reduced from 13 to 6. Second, the content of the list was revised: eight symptoms were deleted; one new symptom (appetite disturbance) was added; and a number of symptoms were reworded (e.g., ※pessimistic attitude, brooding, or self-pity§ was replaced by ※hopelessness§). Finally, in keeping with the reduced size of the symptom list, the cutoff for the minimum number of symptoms required for a diagnosis was reduced from three to two.The DSM-III-R criteria were retained with only minor changes in DSM-IV. An impairment criterion was added and the primary-secondary subtype distinction was eliminated. Based on data from the DSM-IV Mood Disorders Field Trial, however, an alternative set of symptom criteria was included in the Appendix (Table 3).There have been two major criticisms of the symptom criteria for dysthymic disorder. First, the content validity of the set of associated symptoms, particularly those in DSM-III-R and DSM-IV, has been questioned. Specifically, it has been argued that the symptoms that are most characteristic of dysthymic disorder, particularly cognitive symptoms, are underrepresented in the DSM-III-R/DSM-IV criteria set, whereas vegetative symptoms, which may be less characteristic, are overrepresented.7Second, the discriminant validity of the criteria for dysthymic disorder has been challenged, particularly with respect to major depressive disorder. There is consistent evidence indicating that there is a very high level of comorbidity between dysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder.7, 10, 12, 18 For example, in the DSM-IV Mood Disorders Field Trial, 62% of 190 DSM-III-R dysthymic patients met criteria for a current, and 80% for a lifetime, diagnosis of major depression.5One reason for the considerable overlap between these conditions may be the high degree of overlap in the lists of associated symptoms in the two criteria sets.7 For example, of the six DSM-III-R and DSM-IV dysthymic disorder symptoms, four (sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance, lack of energy or fatigue, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions) are also criteria for major depressive disorder. Conversely, four of the eight associated symptoms (other than depressed mood) in the DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder are included in the list of associated symptoms for dysthymic disorder.In this article, we review the available literature on the content and discriminant validity of the dysthymic disorder symptom criteria and present relevant data from the DSM-IV Mood Disorders Field Trial."
Sintering of solid waste generated in iron and steel manufacturing process in Shougang Jingtang,"Yuan-dong Pei, Sheng-li Wu, Shao-guo Chen, Zhi-xing Zhao, Yao-sheng Luo, ","Journal of Iron and Steel Research, International, Volume 24, Issue 7, July 2017, Pages 697-704, ","It is important to make full use of waste generated in the iron and steel manufacturing process for energy saving, emission reduction, low carbon production and a circular economy. Based on research on different kinds of industrial solid wastes from Shougang Jingtang, wastes have been optimized for use in sintering. At first, basic tests for all kinds of solid wastes that may be used in sintering were carried out, including chemical composition, calorific value of a fuel, holding time at high temperatures, the sintering pot test, etc. The results show that the appropriate solid waste ratios for current sintering conditions are: steel slag <5%, scale 2.0%, environmental ash 2.0%, and cyclone ash 1.0%; blast furnace dry ash, sintering electric field ash, and steelmaking ash should not be circulated in sintering. As for the fuel structure, both coking ash and nut coke should be below 15%. By optimizing the addition of solid wastes, the damage of harmful elements to sintering and blast furnaces has been significantly reduced, which satisfies the demands for blast furnace materials and earns benefits. The utilization of solid wastes has made a contribution to the circular economy and sustainable development."

Gynecologic oncology patients with a documented history of mild or low-risk, moderate immediate HSRs to carboplatin/cisplatin and continued treatment with 4-step, one-solution desensitization protocols in the outpatient infusion center were included. Patients with delayed HSRs or immediate high-risk, moderate or severe HSRs were excluded. The primary end point was the rate of successful administrations of each course of platinums.From January 2011 to June 2013, eighteen eligible patients were evaluated for outpatient 4-step, one-solution desensitization. Thirteen patients had a history of HSRs to carboplatin and 5 with HSRs to cisplatin. All of 18 patients successfully completed 94 (98.9%) of 95 desensitization courses in the outpatient infusion center. Eight of 8 (100%) patients with initial mild HSRs completed 29/29 (100%) desensitization courses, and 9 of 10 (90%) of patients with initial moderate HSRs completed 65/66 (94%) desensitization courses. In total, 65/95 (68%) desensitizations resulted in no breakthrough reactions, and mild, moderate and severe breakthrough reactions were seen in 19%, 12% and 1% desensitizations, respectively. No patients were hospitalized during desensitization.The outpatient rapid, 4-step, one-solution desensitization protocol was effective and appeared safe among gynecologic oncology patients who experienced mild to low-risk, moderate HSRs to carboplatin/cisplatin."

A General Framework for Detecting Disease Associations with Rare Variants in Sequencing Studies,"Dan-Yu Lin, Zheng-Zheng Tang, ","The American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 89, Issue 3, 9 September 2011, Pages 354-367, ","Biological and empirical evidence suggests that rare variants account for a large proportion of the genetic contributions to complex human diseases. Recent technological advances in high-throughput sequencing platforms have made it possible for researchers to generate comprehensive information on rare variants in large samples. We provide a general framework for association testing with rare variants by combining mutation information across multiple variant sites within a gene and relating the enriched genetic information to disease phenotypes through appropriate regression models. Our framework covers all major study designs (i.e., case-control, cross-sectional, cohort and family studies) and all common phenotypes (e.g., binary, quantitative, and age at onset), and it allows arbitrary covariates (e.g., environmental factors and ancestry variables). We derive theoretically optimal procedures for combining rare mutations and construct suitable test statistics for various biological scenarios. The allele-frequency threshold can be fixed or variable. The effects of the combined rare mutations on the phenotype can be in the same direction or different directions. The proposed methods are statistically more powerful and computationally more efficient than existing ones. An application to a deep-resequencing study of drug targets led to a discovery of rare variants associated with total cholesterol. The relevant software is freely available."

Lattice Boltzmann modeling of carbon deposition in porous anode of a solid oxide fuel cell with internal reforming,"Han Xu, Zheng Dang, ","Applied Energy, Volume 178, 15 September 2016, Pages 294-307, ","A pore scale Lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is developed for multi-component mass transport and carbon deposition in the porous anode of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) fed with methane. In this model, the reforming and electrochemical reactions are discretely coupled via local molar fluxes of reactive gas species at catalytically active sites and triple phase boundaries (TPBs). By considering the heterogeneity of anode microstructure, the present pore scale LB model is capable of quantitatively predicting the local distributions of both the position and the amount of deposited carbon in the irregular porous anode. Using this model, the characteristics of carbon deposition in the anode are investigated. It is found that the heterogeneity of anode microstructure has significant influence on mass transport and carbon deposition. Increasing the pre-reforming extent of methane and decreasing the operating temperature are beneficial for the suppression of carbon deposition, whereas they will cause a relatively inferior cell performance. The LB model and results presented in this study are beneficial to mechanism investigation of carbon deposition. Furthermore, they are also helpful for studying the correlations between anode microstructure and carbon deposition and then bridging the manufacture of SOFC electrodes and their performance, which is useful to propose effective suggestions for avoiding performance degradation of SOFC induced by carbon deposition."

Impacts of chemical fractionation on Zhundong coal's chemical structure and pyrolysis reactivity,"Yan Zhao, Li Liu, Peng-Hua Qiu, Xing Xie, Shao-Zeng Sun, ","Fuel Processing Technology, Volume 155, January 2017, Pages 144-152, ","The investigation to the structure change of coal during demineralization is the prerequisite in evaluating the minerals' catalytic action in pyrolysis. In the study, Zhundong raw coal samples were first treated using the chemical fractionation method, and then the pyrolysis reactivities of the samples were measured on a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). In order to understand the chemical structures of the samples, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and a series of original infrared structure parameters were employed. Finally, a correlation was established between the infrared structural parameters and the pyrolysis reactivity. It is indicated that the characteristic of Zhundong coal is different from other low-rank coals in inorganic mineral composition and chemical structure of organic matter. Dilute sulfuric acid washing can increase the carboxyl group and phenolic hydroxyl group contents, but has insignificant impacts on aliphatic hydrogen content, aromatic hydrogen content, and hydrogen atom distributions in aliphatic and aromatic structures. Washing process using concentrated HCl/HF can further increase the carboxyl group content but has little impact on the phenolic hydroxyl group content. In addition, the washing can also shorten the aliphatic side chains and bridge bonds, causing the aromatic ring fusing lower and substitution higher. Dilute sulfuric acid and concentrated HCl/HF washings increase the pyrolysis reactivity of Zhundong coal. Finally, a correlation was regressed between the infrared structural parameter S and the pyrolysis reactivity, which was proved to be effective to predict the pyrolysis reactivity of coal."

In this investigation we assessed the relationship between these global indexes and directly measured indexes of regional function during 15 minutes of coronary occlusion followed by 120 minutes of reperfus on in 22 open-chest dogs. A computerizod nuclear cardiac probe was used to assess EF and PDFR. Indexes of regional function were measured by Doppler ultrasonic wall-thickening probes. During coronary occlusion, paradoxical systolic thinning occurred and the EF and PDFR decreased an average of 31.6% and 24.4%, respectively. During reperfusion the EF and PDFR improved rapidly and at 60 minutes were similar to baselline. Systolic wall thickening improved more gradually and remained abnormal throughout reperfusion. Likewise, indexes of diastolic function (mean rate to half end-diastolic thinning and late diastolic thinning fraction) recovered slowly and remained abnormal throughout reperfusion (78% and 69.7%, respectively). The correlation between the rate of change of giobal and regional function was poor during both coronary occlusion and reperfusion. Thus, during coronary occlusion the global and regional indexes of ventricular function undergo directionally similar changes. However, during coronary reperfusion the global indexes do not reflect the slow recovery of the stunned myocardium."
Mode of death after contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention: A report from the Evaluation of Drug Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events registry,"Joshua M. Stolker, David J. Cohen, Jason B. Lindsey, Kevin F. Kennedy, Steven P. Marso, ","American Heart Journal, Volume 162, Issue 5, November 2011, Pages 914-921, ","When selecting clinical trial end points, some investigators prefer cardiovascular death (CVD) while others believe that all-cause mortality is more relevant. However, the relative contribution of CVD to 1-year mortality after contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is not known.We evaluated the mode of death (MOD) in EVENT, a prospective PCI registry at 55 US hospitals. Vital status was assessed at 6 and 12 months as part of the study protocol, and MOD was independently reviewed in blinded fashion.Between 2004 and 2007, EVENT enrolled 10,144 patients of whom 295 (2.9%) died within the first year: 51 (17%) ≒30 days; and 244 (83%) between 31 and 365 days after index PCI. Overall, CVD accounted for 42% of deaths, and no clear cause could be identified in a substantial subgroup (25% of deaths). Among patients who died ≒30 days, the MOD was more likely to be CVD (odds ratio 3.96, 95% CI 2.08-7.55), whereas the incidence of CVD and non-CVD was similar after 30 days. Findings were similar after a series of sensitivity analyses including reassignment of unknown MOD to the CVD category, using multiple imputation modeling, or when evaluating MOD in prespecified subgroups of patients with diabetes, acute coronary syndromes, or left ventricular dysfunction.Among unselected PCI patients, 1-year mortality is approximately 3%, and CVD is confirmed in <50% of all deaths. Regardless of analytic approach, CVD is the primary contributor to overall mortality during the first 30 days after PCI, whereas rates of CVD and non-CVD are remarkably similar after the first month after PCI."

Identification of 2-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose Metabolites by19F{1H} Hetero-RELAY,"Thomas M. O'Connell, Robert E. London, ","Journal of Magnetic Resonance, Series B, Volume 109, Issue 3, December 1995, Pages 264-269, ","It has been proposed that in mammalian systems the glucose analog 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is phosphoryated and subsequently converted to the corresponding mannose derivative via the action of phosphoglucose isomerase. As is generally true in metabolic studies of fluorinated molecules, the fluorine spectrum alone is suggestive, without providing definitive structural evidence, while the use of1H NMR techniques generally suffers from a lack of adequate selectivity. A1H每19F version of the hetero-RELAY experiment has been applied to this problem. Formation of the corresponding C-6 phosphorylated 2-FDG analog with hexokinase, followed by treatment of the resulting phosphorylated products with phosphoglucose isomerase, resulted in the observation of additional19F resonances consistent with the corresponding 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-mannose-6-phosphate metabolite. A more definitive product identification was obtained using the hetero-RELAY experiment, which provides a complete19F-decoupled proton spectrum for each of the fluorinated species."
A numerical study of the train-induced unsteady airflow in a subway tunnel with natural ventilation ducts using the dynamic layering method,"Yuan-dong HUANG, Wei GAO, Chang-Nyung KIM, ","Journal of Hydrodynamics, Ser. B, Volume 22, Issue 2, April 2010, Pages 164-172, ","The objective of this study is to investigate numerically the characteristics of train-induced unsteady airflow in a subway tunnel with natural ventilation ducts. A three-dimensional numerical model using the dynamic layering method for the moving boundary of a train is first developed, and then it is validated against the model tunnel experimental data. With the tunnel and subway train geometries in the numerical model exactly the same as those in the model tunnel experimental test, but with the ventilation ducts being connected to the tunnel ceiling and a barrier placed at the tunnel outlet, the three-dimensional train-induced unsteady tunnel flows are numerically simulated. The computed distributions of the pressure and the air velocity in the tunnel as well as the time series of the mass flow rate at the ventilation ducts reveal the impact of the train motion on the exhaust and suction of the air through ventilation ducts and the effects of a barrier placed at the tunnel outlet on the duct ventilation performance. As the train approaches a ventilation duct, the air is pushed out of the tunnel through the duct. As the train passes the ventilation duct, the exhaust flow in the duct is changed rapidly to the suction flow. After the train passes the duct, the suction mass flow rate at the duct decreases with time since the air pressure at the opening of the duct is gradually recovered with time. A drastic change in the mass flow rate at a ventilation duct while a train passes the corresponding ventilation duct, causes a change in the exhaust mass flow rate at other ventilation ducts. Also, when a barrier is placed at the tunnel outlet, the air volume discharge rate at each ventilation duct is greatly increased, i.e., the barrier placed at the tunnel outlet can improve remarkably the ventilation performance through each duct."

In the periodic waveguide, non-Bragg gaps beyond the Bragg ones, which appear in the transmission spectra, are created by different transverse mode resonances. The transmission spectra of the waveguide containing a defect showed that a defect mode was present inside the non-Bragg gap. The NBDM has quite different features compared to the Bragg defect mode, which includes more complex, high-order guided wave modes. In our study, we filled the corrugated waveguide with LCs to realize the tunability of the NBDM. The simulated results showed that the NBDM in a corrugated waveguide filled with LCs can be used in filters, sensors, switches, and other terahertz integrated devices."
Particle Deposition in Oral-tracheal Airway Models with Very Low Inhalation Profiles,"Zheng Li, ","Journal of Bionic Engineering, Volume 9, Issue 2, June 2012, Pages 252-261, ","Considerable progress has been made on modeling particle deposition in the oral-tracheal airway under some normal breathing conditions, i.e., resting, light activity and moderate exercise. None of these standard breathing patterns correspond to very low inhalation profiles. It is known that particle deposition in the oral-tracheal airway is greatly influenced by flow and particle inlet conditions. In this work, very low inhalation flow rates are considered. Particle deposition is numerically investigated in different oral-tracheal airway models, i.e., circular, elliptic and realistic oral-tracheal airway models. Both micro- and nano-particles that are normally present in cigarette smoke are considered. Results show that inhalation profiles greatly influence the particle deposition. Due to relatively low flow rate, for ultra-fine particles, the oral deposition is enhanced due to longer residence time in oral cavity and stronger Brownian motion. However, for larger particles, less particles deposit in the oral-tracheal airway due to the weaker impaction. The transition happens when particle size changes from 0.01 米m to 0.1 米m. The influence of the limited entrance area is shown and discussed. Under the low inhalation profiles, the highest deposition fraction could be in either circular or realistic models depending on the particle property and the geometric characteristic of oral cavity. The knowledge obtained in this study may be beneficial for the design of bionic inhaler and understanding of health effect from smoke particle on human being."

Risk assessment of an oxygen-enhanced combustor using a structural model based on the FMEA and fuzzy fault tree,"Zhen Chen, Xiaona Wu, Jianguo Qin, ","Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries, Volume 32, November 2014, Pages 349-357, ","The oxygen-enhanced combustor has the advantages of high burning efficiency and low emissions. However, it should not be promoted for industrial use until its reliability and safety have been fully recognized. A new methodology is proposed to assess the risk of an oxygen-enhanced combustor using a structural model based on the FMEA and fuzzy fault tree. In addition, it is applied to a selected pilot semi-industrial combustor. To identify the hazard source comprehensively, the pilot is divided into four subsystems: the combustor subsystem, feed subsystem, ignition subsystem and exhaust subsystem. According to the operational parameters of flow (flow rate, temperature and pressure) and the component functions in different subsystems, the cause and effect matrix can be built using the structural model, and the relationship between the operational parameters and the effects of the change for the operational parameters on the system can be presented. Based on the results of cause and effect matrix, the FMEA can be built to describe the failed models and accident scenarios of the pilot. The main accident forms include leakage, injury, fire and explosion. Accordingly, with the severity and probability analysis of different accident forms, the fire and explosion accidents should be further accessed quantitatively using the fuzzy fault tree analysis. The fault trees can be obtained in accordance with the FMEA, and the qualitative assessments of the basic events can be collected by using expert scoring. A hybrid approach for the fuzzy set theory and weight analysis is investigated to quantify the occurrence probability of basic events. Then, the importance analysis of the fault trees, including the hazard importance of basic events and the cut set importance, is performed to help determine the weak links of the fire and explosion trees. Finally, some of the most effective measures are presented to improve the reliability and safety of the combustion system."

Onion fly (Delia antiqua) egg depositional behaviour: Pinpointing host acceptance by an insect herbivore,"Thomas M. Mowry, Joseph L. Spencer, James E. Keller, James R. Miller, ","Journal of Insect Physiology, Volume 35, Issue 4, 1989, Pages 331-339, ","Egg deposition by the onion fly, Delia antiqua (Meigen), consisted of an almost completely deterministic behavioural sequence including Subsurface Probing, Egg Into Bursa, Stationary Phase, Ovipositor Contractility and Egg Expulsion. Ancillary behaviours, such as body repositioning, leg grooming and mouthpart extension, occurred during, but not between, the sequential behaviours. Stationary Phase duration (mean ㊣ SEM = 18 ㊣ 0 s) was less variable than the durations for other behavioural states, indicating a very precise timing mechanism associated with fertilization. Small, but significant, shortening of the ovipositor from Subsurface Probing (3.7 mm) to Egg Into Bursa (3.2 mm) to Stationary Phase (2.9 mm) suggests exact positioning of the egg for fertilization. The command to move an egg, sent during Subsurface Probing, marks the boundary between examining and consuming behaviours and appears to be associated with a switch from motor programmes generating highly probabilistic predepositional behaviour to a programme generating deterministic depositional behaviour. Onion fly egg deposition is a fixed action pattern possibly triggered by mechanosensory and/or chemosensory input received by ovipositor setae during Subsurface Probing. This deterministic depositional behaviour contrasts with the recently preceding unfixed, sensory-dependent predepositional examining behaviours. Hence, for D. antiqua, egg movement is synonymous with ovipositional host acceptance."

A system dynamic analysis of China＊s oil supply chain: Over-capacity and energy security issues,"Lingying Pan, Pei Liu, Zheng Li, ","Applied Energy, Volume 188, 15 February 2017, Pages 508-520, ","Over-capacity problem in refining sector and energy security for oil supply are critical issues for China＊s oil industry. As governmental intervention plays a significant part in current and future development of oil industry, over-capacity problem would not be solved without macro-regulatory. Though China is promoting large-scale strategic reserve of crude oil, there is rare quantitative evaluation on the capability of the oil industry in dealing with import disruption. In this paper, a system dynamic model is established for oil supply chain analysis. Based on the model, a quantitative measurement is proposed to evaluate the over-capacity extent of refining industry. The over-capacity extent is classified into three levels, according to varied demand fluctuation the supply chain is expected to deal with. By comparing the modeling results and historical data of 2012 and 2013, we conclude that over-capacity in China＊s refining industry is in the severest level. The measurement reveals the driven-force of over-capacity from supply chain perspective, and demonstrates a quantitative method to figure out the proper capacity of energy supply industry. Second, the model simulates how oil supply chain responds to crude oil import disruption and the subsequent impacts. The modeling results indicate that the current configuration of China＊s oil supply system is able to maintain sustainable supply under a less-than-180-day crude oil import disruption. The model provides a supply chain perspective in looking into energy security issues, and reveals the relationship between strategic petroleum reserve and the capability to cope with supply risks. In summary, the system dynamic model proposed in this paper is applicable for analysis on capacity planning and reserve strategy design of oil supply chain, providing valuable suggestion for the future development of China＊s oil industry. The design concept and method of the model can be used for analysis of other energy industry."

"Blueberry VcLON 2, a peroxisomal LON protease, is involved in abiotic stress tolerance","Wenrong Chen, Junyi Shao, Meijuan Ye, Keda Yu, Weidong Guo, ","Environmental and Experimental Botany, Volume 134, February 2017, Pages 1-11, ","Peroxisomal LON2 protease plays a pivotal role in protein quality control through its proteolysis and chaperone functions. However, little is known regarding its function in the regulation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis and in adversity tolerance in plants. To begin to assess the function of LON2, we isolated a VcLON2 cDNA from blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), which is predicted to encode a peroxisomal protein containing a long N-terminal domain, a central AAA+ module and a C-terminal proteolytic domain. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that VcLON2 was expressed ubiquitously throughout the blueberry plant including vegetative and reproductive organs, and its expression increased in older tissues. Overexpression of VcLON2 in tobacco led to increased tolerance to NaCl, PEG and heat stresses, as indicated by the lower contents of H2O2, malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl groups, compared with wild type (WT). In contrast, silencing of the VcLON2 homolog, NbLON2, in tobacco seedlings resulted in significantly higher sensitivity to various abiotic stresses. Furthermore, the activity of catalase (CAT), a peroxisomal enzyme involved in the detoxification of ROS, was found to be elevated in VcLON2-overexpressed seedlings and conversely reduced in NbLON2-silenced seedlings under non-stress and stress conditions, compared with WT. Our results suggest that VcLON2 plays an important role in the maintenance of the ROS-scavenging functions of peroxisomes, which is necessary for tolerance to abiotic stresses."

Experimental investigation on the micro damage evolution of chemical corroded limestone subjected to cyclic loads,"Hao Li, Dongmin Yang, Zuliang Zhong, Yong Sheng, Xinrong Liu, ","International Journal of Fatigue, Volume 113, August 2018, Pages 23-32, ","Micro damage evolution in chemical corroded limestone samples subjected to cyclic loads is investigated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) system. Based on the experimental data of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), T2 values and porosity, the micro damage evolution process is visualized and analyzed. It is found that the porosity and micro cracking of the corroded limestone samples increase with the cyclic loading, and the micro damage evolution process consists of three distinct stages: micro crack emergence stage, micro damage development stage and damage development accelerated stage. Chemical erosion is found to have a significant influence on the propagation of micro cracks and accelerate the damage development of the limestone samples under cyclic loading. With the same number of load cycles, the chemical corroded samples always have lower peak strength than that of the water softened samples. Before the inflection point in the micro damage-loading cycles curve, the main damage is caused by new micro cracks increase inside the limestone; while after this point, the new micro crack emergence is being restrained, and the existed micro cracks connect into rupture bands. A damage model is finally proposed to quantify the damage evolution of the chemical corroded rocks subjected to cyclic loads."

We report updated efficacy outcomes from a protocol-defined 5-year follow-up sensitivity analysis and long-term toxicity findings.In this ongoing randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, eligible women aged 18 years or older (≡20 years in Japan) with stage 1每3c (modified to stage 2每3c in February, 2010) operable breast cancer, who had completed neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab with no evidence of disease recurrence or metastatic disease at study entry. Patients who were eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via permuted blocks stratified according to hormone receptor status (hormone receptor-positive vs hormone receptor-negative), nodal status (0 vs 1每3 vs or ≡4 positive nodes), and trastuzumab adjuvant regimen (given sequentially vs concurrently with chemotherapy), then implemented centrally via an interactive voice and web-response system, to receive 1 year of oral neratinib 240 mg/day or matching placebo. Treatment was given continuously for 1 year, unless disease recurrence or new breast cancer, intolerable adverse events, or consent withdrawal occurred. Patients, investigators, and trial funder were masked to treatment allocation. The predefined endpoint of the 5-year analysis was invasive disease-free survival, analysed by intention to treat.

Thermograms showed that with S25 concentration increasing, transitions of FO and LO shifted to lower and largely to higher temperatures, respectively, while crystallization temperature of KO slightly decreased. Negative, positive and low values of interaction enthalpy (忖Hint) suggested the adverse, beneficial and limited effect of S25 on the crystallization of S25/FO, S25/LO and S25/KO mixtures, respectively.

A state-space method for real-time transient simulation of indoor airflow,"Qiujian Wang, Yiqun Pan, Mingya Zhu, Zhizhong Huang, Peng Xu, ","Building and Environment, Volume 126, December 2017, Pages 184-194, ","Inhomogeneous airflow distribution is common in air-conditioned rooms, especially the large open spaces. To evaluate the thermal comfort of such space, or the control performance of the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in an efficient way, one will need a fast prediction method to simulate the airflow and temperature distribution. This paper proposes a discrete state-space method, called state-space fluid dynamics (SFD), for the fast indoor airflow simulation. To handle time-varying velocity and temperature field, SFD converts all the governing equations of fluid dynamics into the form of a state-space model. Four typical cases are selected to evaluate both the accuracy and speed of SFD, compared with fast fluid dynamics (FFD), which is another fast airflow simulation program. Results show that SFD is capable of achieving faster-than-real-time airflow simulation with an accuracy similar to FFD. The computing time of SFD is longer than FFD when the time step size is the same. However, SFD can generally produce better results than FFD when the time step size is larger, which allows SFD run faster than FFD."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible roles and related target genes of miR-486-5p in NSCLC progression.pcDNA3.1(+)/Pri-miR486 recombinant plasmid and miR-486-5p inhibitor were transfected into NSCLC cells and theirs effects were evaluated by qRT-PCR. Then, MTT assay and Colony formation assay were performed to determine the potential roles of miR-486-5p played on NSCLC cellular proliferation and cloning in vitro. We also initially investigated the target genes of miR-486-5p by using bioinformatic methods, qRT-PCR and western blot.pcDNA3.1(+)/Pri-miR486 recombinant plasmid significantly upregulated the expression of miR-486-5p, while miR-486-5p inhibitor significantly downregulated its expression. Upregulation of miR-486-5p promoted the cellular proliferation and cloning, while miR-486-5p silencing restrained the cellular proliferation and cloning. Furthermore, four potential target genes (PIK3R1, PTEN, MAP3K7 and FOXO1) of miR-486-5p were screened out. Finally, we found that upregulation of miR-486-5p in NSCLC cells significantly reduced PTEN and increased AKT expression levels, whereas miR-486-5p silencing increased PTEN and reduced AKT expression.

Chen, ","Neuroscience, Volume 344, 6 March 2017, Pages 265-275, ","Cysteine protease Cathepsin S (CatS) expressed by spinal microglia has been shown to play a critical role in nerve injury and inflammation-induced chronic pain. However, whether microglial CatS contributes to remifentanil-induced acute hyperalgesia remains unstudied. In the present study, intravenous remifentanil infusion induced a significant increase in the expression of premature and mature form of CatS in the activated microglia in the spinal cord. Spinal delivery of irreversible CatS inhibitor LHVS reduced hyperalgesia, attenuated activation of spinal microglia and blocked phosphorylation of NMDA receptor NR1 subunit induced by remifentanil. Furthermore, inhibition of microglia by minocycline effectively suppressed remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia, as well as CatS upregulation. In addition, remifentanil infusion also induced an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in spinal neurons. Systemic administration of ROS scavenger PBN was sufficient to suppress remifentanil-induced painful hypersensitivity. Removal of ROS by PBN prevented upregulation of mature CatS in spinal microglia. However, increased protein level of premature form of CatS was not affected by PBN. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that neuronal ROS promote maturation of microglial CatS which facilitates activation of NMDA in the spinal dorsal horn. Therefore, such mechanism is involved in neuron-microglia positive feedback and contributes to remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia."
Toward a universal equation to estimate postmortem interval,"Amy E. Maile, Christopher G. Inoue, Larry E. Barksdale, David O. Carter, ","Forensic Science International, Volume 272, March 2017, Pages 150-153, ","Estimating postmortem interval is an important goal in medicolegal death investigations. Although several methods have been developed to achieve this goal, many of these require significant time and advanced expertise to generate a reliable estimate. Unfortunately these techniques do not provide much insight during the early stages of an investigation when critical decisions must be made regarding the allocation of investigative resources. An equation was recently developed to address this problem: provide a preliminary estimate of postmortem interval to initiate an investigation while more advanced techniques are conducted. To evaluate this equation, we used it to estimate postmortem interval at multiple indoor death scenes with known PMI in Nebraska and Hawai＆i. This equation allowed us to accurately estimate PMI at 15 of 19 (79%) indoor death scenes. In Nebraska, this equation was accurate at 100% of the scenes. In Hawai＆i, this equation was accurate at 60% of the scenes. All inaccurate estimates of postmortem interval were associated with at least 20% mass loss and a postmortem interval of ≡4 days. Although this equation was accurate at the majority of the death scenes attended, we conclude that more research is warranted, particularly the effect of climate on decomposition and the investigators＊ ability to accurately estimate soft tissue mass loss."
The distinction between freshwater- and terrestrial-based diets: methodological concerns and archaeological applications of sulphur stable isotope analysis,"Karen L. Privat, Tamsin C. O'Connell, Robert E. M. Hedges, ","Journal of Archaeological Science, Volume 34, Issue 8, August 2007, Pages 1197-1204, ","Sulphur isotopes in archaeological bone collagen are not routinely analysed in palaeodietary studies. Here we investigate the potential contribution that sulphur isotope analysis can provide toward the study of ancient human diet and economy, with particular emphasis on the distinction between freshwater and terrestrial consumers. For material from the Late Bronze Age site of Chicha in the south-western Eurasian forest-steppe, sulphur isotopes effectively separate freshwater and terrestrial animal food resources. The sulphur isotope data coupled with nitrogen isotope values from Chicha reflect a dietary reliance upon freshwater animal protein (fish) for the Late Bronze Age inhabitants. In contrast, sulphur isotope values for freshwater and terrestrial potential food species from the Eneolithic site of Bil'shivtsi in western Ukraine were indistinguishable, demonstrating that 汛34S values cannot always be relied upon to identify freshwater and terrestrial consumers. The data from this study support the adoption of 汛34S analysis as a standard component of palaeodietary studies; apart from its potential to distinguish freshwater from terrestrial consumers, it can provide supplementary dietary information not evident from the carbon and nitrogen isotope data. In addition, certain indices are considered that may be used to assess the validity of sulphur isotope data, as currently exist for carbon and nitrogen. According to the analysis of modern collagen samples, N:S appears to be a broad indicator of collagen sulphur isotope quality. However, more work needs to be done to establish an effective means by which highly-altered sulphur isotope values can be identified and thereby removed from consideration."

A new low capacitance silicon pixel detector is proposed, which is based on a new electrode geometry with reduced effective electrode area while keeping the sensitive volume unchanged. Detector electrical characteristics including electrostatic potential, electric field, full depletion voltage, and capacitance have been simulated in detail using a 3D TCAD tool. From these simulations and calculations, we confirm that the new detector structure has a much reduced capacitance (by a factor of 3) as compared to the traditional pixel detectors with the same sensitive volume. This reduction in detector capacitance can certainly improve the detector signal to noise ratio. However, the full depletion voltage for the new structure is larger than that of the traditional one due to the small electrode effect."

Because the most common tests for HIV infection rely on detecting antibodies to HIV, they may also detect antibodies induced by a candidate HIV vaccine. The detection of vaccine-induced antibodies to HIV by serological tests is most commonly referred to as vaccine-induced sero-reactivity (VISR). VISR can be misinterpreted as a sign of HIV infection in a healthy study participant. In a participant who has developed vaccine-induced antibodies, accurate diagnosis of HIV infection (or lack thereof) may require specialized tests and algorithms (differential testing) that are usually not available in community settings. Organizations sponsoring clinical testing of preventive HIV vaccine candidates have an ethical obligation not only to inform healthy volunteers about the potential problems associated with participating in a clinical trial but also to help manage any resulting issues. This article explores the scope of VISR-related issues that become increasingly prevalent as the search for an effective HIV vaccine continues and will be paramount once a preventive vaccine is deployed. We also describe ways in which organizations conducting HIV vaccine trials have addressed these issues and outline areas where more work is needed."

Cyclohexen-2-one is first selectively reduced at the olefinic double bond by the cation containing biacetyldianyl to give cyclohexanone that is subsequently hydrogenated to the saturated alcohol. This reaction goes through two intermediates in two parallel and finally concurrent pathways; the differential rate equations have been integrated and the simulation of the process agrees reasonably well with experimental measurements.

A post-processor like the Ensemble Pre-Processor (EPP) developed by U.S. National Weather Service must be used to remove various biases and to extract useful predictive information from those forecasts. In this paper, we investigate how different designs of canonical events in the EPP can help post-process precipitation forecasts from the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) and Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2). The use of canonical events allow those products to be linked seamlessly and then the post-processed ensemble precipitation forecasts can be generated using the Schaake Shuffle procedure. We used the post-processed ensemble precipitation forecasts to drive a distributed hydrological model to obtain ensemble streamflow forecasts and evaluated those forecasts against the observed streamflow. We found that the careful design of canonical events can help extract more useful information, especially when up-to-date observed precipitation is used to setup the canonical events. We also found that streamflow forecasts using post-processed precipitation forecasts have longer lead times and higher accuracy than streamflow forecasts made by traditional Extend Streamflow Prediction (ESP) and the forecasts based on original GEFS and CFSv2 precipitation forecasts."

Microscopic每macroscopic entanglement transfer in optomechanical system: Non-Markovian effects,"Qingxia Mu, Hao Li, Xia Huang, Xinyu Zhao, ","Optics Communications, Volume 426, 1 November 2018, Pages 70-76, ","In this paper, we investigate the entanglement transfer in two coupled optomechanical systems. A master equation governing the dynamics of the optomechanical systems is derived beyond the Markov approximation. Based on the master equation, we investigate the entanglement transfer from microscopic objects (electromagnetic cavities) to macroscopic objects (mechanical resonators). We show the memory effect of the environment can enhance the entanglement transfer between cavities and resonators. The non-Markovian feedback results in a stronger entanglement transfer, and it also leads to an entanglement revival in the resonators which can make the entanglement last for a longer time. Besides, we also show that in order to achieve higher entanglement transfer, some crucial system parameters such as the inter-cavity coupling should be properly chosen based on the strength of the memory effect. It is our hope that our research is helpful for future studies about entanglement transfer between microscopic and macroscopic objects, particularly for the impact from the environment."

However, cost-effective detection of exosomes in routine clinical settings is still challenging. Herein, we present a ZnO nanowires coated three-dimensional (3D) scaffold chip device for effective immunocapture and classically visible and colorimetric detection of exosomes. The chip device is composed of 3D Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) scaffold skeleton covered by free-standing ZnO nanowire array. The interconnected micropores of 3D scaffold induces the fluid flow with chaotic or vortex feature, and ZnO nanowire array provides large surface area for immobilization of exosome specific antibody as well as size exclusion-like effect for retaining exosomes. These synergistically and significantly enhance the capture of exosomes at a high flow rate. The captured exosomes are detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled antibody which can initiate 3,3＊,5,5＊-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)-based colorimetric sensing. The quantitative readout of exosomes is easily accomplished by UV每vis spectrometry or microplate reader with a linear range of 2.2℅105 to 2.4℅107 particles/米L and a minimal detectable concentration of 2.2℅104 particles/米L. This chip device was applicable to clinical samples where cancer patients demonstrate statistically significant increase in exosomes compared with healthy individuals. Thus, our chip device is cost-effective and easy-to-use, facilitating visible and colorimetric assay with high sensitivity toward clinical applications."

MFM subspecialists are complementary to obstetric care providers in providing consultations, co-management, or transfer of care for complicated patients before, during, and after pregnancy. The MFM subspecialist provides peer and patient education and performs research concerning the most recent approaches and treatments for obstetrical problems, thus promoting risk-appropriate care for these complicated pregnancies. The relationship between the obstetric care provider and the MFM subspecialist depends on the acuity of the maternal and/or fetal condition and the local resources. To achieve the goal of promoting early access and sustained adequate prenatal care for all pregnant women, we encourage collaboration with obstetricians, family physicians, certified midwives, and others, and we also encourage providing preconception, prenatal, and postpartum care counseling and coordination. Effective communication between all obstetric care team members is imperative. This special report was written with the intent that it would be broad in scope and appeal to a diverse readership, including administrators, allowing it to be applied to various systems of care both horizontally and vertically. We understand that these relationships are often complex and there are more models of care than could be addressed in this document. However, we aimed to promote the development of a highly effective team approach to the care of the high-risk pregnancy that will be useful in the most common models for obstetric care in the United States. The MFM subspecialist functions most effectively within a fully integrated and collaborative health care environment. This document defines the various roles that the MFM subspecialist can fulfill within different heath care systems through consultation, co-management, and transfer of care, as well as education, research, and leadership."
Selection of therapeutic H5N1 monoclonal antibodies following IgVH repertoire analysis in mice,"Sean A. Gray, Margaret Moore, Emily J. VandenEkart, Richard P. Roque, Christopher H. Clegg, ","Antiviral Research, Volume 131, July 2016, Pages 100-108, ","The rapid rate of influenza virus mutation drives the emergence of new strains that inflict serious seasonal epidemics and less frequent, but more deadly, pandemics. While vaccination provides the best protection against influenza, its utility is often diminished by the unpredictability of new pathogenic strains. Consequently, efforts are underway to identify new antiviral drugs and monoclonal antibodies that can be used to treat recently infected individuals and prevent disease in vulnerable populations. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and the analysis of antibody gene repertoires is a valuable tool for Ab discovery. Here, we describe a technology platform for isolating therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) by analyzing the IgVH repertoires of mice immunized with recombinant H5N1 hemagglutinin (rH5). As an initial proof of concept, 35 IgVH genes were selected using a CDRH3 search algorithm and co-expressed in a murine IgG2a expression vector with a panel of germline murine kappa genes. Culture supernatants were then screened for antigen binding. Seventeen of the 35 IgVH MAbs (49%) bound rH5VN1203 in preliminary screens and 8 of 9 purified MAbs inhibited 3 heterosubtypic strains of H5N1 virus when assayed by HI. Two of these MAbs demonstrated prophylactic and therapeutic activity in virus-challenged mice. This is the first example in which an NGS discovery platform has been used to isolate anti-influenza MAbs with relevant therapeutic activity."

Consistency analysis is a very important topic to preference relations that can avoid the illogical ranking order. However, all previous multiplicative consistency concepts for TFRPRs cannot well address this type of preference relations. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new multiplicative consistency concept for TFRPRs, which can be seen as a natural extension of Tanino's multiplicative consistency concept for reciprocal preference relations. Based on the new consistency concept, 0每1 mixed programming models for judging the multiplicative consistency of TFRPRs are constructed, and an approach for deriving multiplicative consistent TFRPRs is provided. Considering the incomplete case, programming models to determine missing values are constructed. Subsequently, a multiplicative consistency based method for decision making with TFRPRs is presented that can address the inconsistent and incomplete cases. Meanwhile, illustrative examples are provided to show the concrete application of the proposed procedure, and comparison analysis is also made."
Structural changes in the C-terminal regulatory region of the Na+/H+ exchanger mediate phosphorylation induced regulation,"Xiuju Li, Morgan F. Khan, David C. Schriemer, Larry Fliegel, ","Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology, Volume 61, August 2013, Pages 153-163, ","The Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is a plasma membrane pH regulatory protein that removes one intracellular H+ in exchange for an extracellular Na+. NHE1 is regulated by phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic regulatory region and amino acids Ser770 and Ser771 of the regulatory domain are necessary for activation by sustained intracellular acidosis. The phosphomimetic mutations (S770D/S771D) resulted in an activated form of the protein. Immunoprecipitation of full length NHE1 protein showed that the phosphomimetic mutant had increased sensitivity to digestion with trypsin indicating a conformational change. Tryptic digestion of purified C-terminal regulatory region showed that the S770D/S771D mutation altered sensitivity to trypsin digestion. Wild type and phosphomimetic purified C-terminal region (577每815) of human NHE1 were compared and tryptophan fluorescence indicated that there were pH-dependent differences in the conformation of the proteins. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the phosphomimetic mutant had a more compact structure. Bottom-up hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry demonstrated that a peptide fragment containing the phosphomimetic mutations became strongly stabilized relative to the wild type protein. Overall, the results suggested that phosphorylation of S770/S771 changes the conformation of the C-terminal regulatory region in a pH-dependent manner, resulting in a more compact region that affects NHE1 activity.

Chart review of the 2 patient groups was performed.The patient groups showed no statistical differences in age, race, cause of impotence or percent with diabetes. The median cylinder length of prostheses placed by the center of excellence surgeon was 2 cm greater than the length of the cylinders placed by the multiple surgeon team (p <0.0001). Excluding cases requiring additional procedures the median placement time was considerably shorter for the center of excellence surgeon than for the multiple surgeon team (34 vs 94 minutes, p <0.0001). There were 8 iatrogenic failures (infection, erosion and poor positioning) requiring surgical removal in the multiple surgeon group but none in the COE group (p <0.05). Although followup for the multiple surgeon team was longer, Kaplan-Meier revision-free survival curves showed significantly longer survival for the center of excellence group (log rank test p = 0.0283).The center of excellence concept in penile prosthesis surgery appears to deliver superior surgical outcomes in terms of shorter operative time, longer cylinders and fewer iatrogenic complications."

All patients aged 18 years or older who were receiving mechanical ventilation in participating ICUs during a 1-week period between January, 2014, and January, 2015, were enrolled into the study. The Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS) was used to stratify risk of ARDS, with a score of 4 or higher defining those at risk of ARDS.

VT was similar for patients at risk and not at risk of ARDS (median 7﹞6 mL/kg PBW [IQR 6﹞7每9﹞1] vs 7﹞9 mL/kg PBW [6﹞8每9﹞1]; p=0﹞346). PEEP was higher in patients at risk of ARDS compared with those not at risk (median 6﹞0 cm H2O [IQR 5﹞0每8﹞0] vs 5﹞0 cm H2O [5﹞0每7﹞0]; p<0﹞0001). The prevalence of ARDS in patients at risk of ARDS was higher than in individuals not at risk of ARDS (19/260 [7%] vs 17/556 [3%]; p=0﹞004). Compared with individuals not at risk of ARDS, patients at risk of ARDS had higher in-hospital mortality (86/543 [16%] vs 74/232 [32%]; p<0﹞0001), ICU mortality (62/533 [12%] vs 66/227 [29%]; p<0﹞0001), and 90-day mortality (109/653 [17%] vs 88/282 [31%]; p<0﹞0001). VT did not differ between patients who did and did not develop ARDS (p=0﹞471 for those at risk of ARDS; p=0﹞323 for those not at risk).Around a third of patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU were at risk of ARDS. Pulmonary complications occur frequently in patients at risk of ARDS and their clinical outcome is worse compared with those not at risk of ARDS. There is potential for improvement in the management of patients without ARDS. Further refinements are needed for prediction of ARDS.None."
Characteristics of Neovascularization in Early Stages of Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy by Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography,"Jiandong Pan, Ding Chen, Xiaoling Yang, Ruitao Zou, Feng Chen, ","American Journal of Ophthalmology, Volume 192, August 2018, Pages 146-156, ","To classify retinal neovascularization in untreated early stages of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) based on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).A cross-sectional study.Thirty-five eyes were included. They underwent color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography (FA), and OCTA examinations. Neovascularizations elsewhere (NVEs), neovascularizations at the disc (NVDs), and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMAs) were scanned by OCTA. The origin and morphology of NVE/NVD/IRMA on OCTA were evaluated. Retinal nonperfusion areas (NPAs) were measured using ImageJ software.In 35 eyes successfully imaged, 75 NVEs, 35 NVDs, and 12 IRMAs were captured. Three proposed subtypes of NVE were identified based on the origins and morphologic features. Type 1 (32 of 75, 42.67%) originated from the venous side, in a tree-like shape. Type 2 (30 of 75, 40.00%) originated from capillary networks, with an octopus-like appearance. Type 3 (13 of 75, 17.33%) originated from the IRMAs, having a sea fan shape. NVD originated from the retinal artery, from the retinal vein, or from the choroid, and arose from the bending vessels near the rim of the optic disc. IRMA originated from and drained into retinal venules, extending into the retina. The initial layer and affiliated NPA were significantly different in the 3 subtypes of NVEs (all P < .01).OCTA allowed identification of the origins and morphologic patterns of neovascularization in PDR. The new classification of retinal neovascularization may be useful to better understand pathophysiological mechanisms and to guide efficient therapeutic strategies."

Seismic performance assessment of steel frame infilled with prefabricated wood shear walls,"Zheng Li, Minjuan He, Xijun Wang, Minghao Li, ","Journal of Constructional Steel Research, Volume 140, January 2018, Pages 62-73, ","Steel-timber hybrid structural systems offer a modern solution for building multi-story structures with more environmentally-friendly features. This paper presents a comprehensive seismic performance assessment for a kind of multi-story steel-timber hybrid structure. In such a hybrid structure, steel moment resisting frames are infilled with prefabricated light wood frame shear walls to serve as the lateral load resisting system (LLRS). In this paper, drift-based performance objectives under various seismic hazard levels were proposed based on experimental observations. Then, a numerical model of the hybrid structure considering damage accumulation and stiffness degradation was developed and verified by experimental results, and nonlinear time-history analyses were conducted to establish a database of seismic responses. The numerical results further serve as a technical basis for estimating the structure's fundamental period and evaluating post-yielding behavior and failure probabilities of the hybrid structure under various seismic hazard levels. A load sharing parameter was defined to describe the wall-frame lateral force distribution, and a formula was proposed and calibrated by the time-history analytical results to estimate the load sharing parameter. Moreover, earthquake-induced non-structural damage and residual deformation were also evaluated, showing that if designed properly, desirable seismic performance with acceptable repair effort can be obtained for the proposed steel-timber hybrid structural system."

3-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Genitography: A Different Look at Cloacal Malformations,"Steven M. Baughman, Randy R. Richardson, Daniel J. Podberesky, Neal C. Dalrymple, Elizabeth B. Yerkes, ","The Journal of Urology, Volume 178, Issue 4, Supplement, October 2007, Pages 1675-1679, ","Standard contrast genitography and endoscopy have been the cornerstone of preoperative investigation of anatomy in complex cloacal malformations. In many cases standard genitography is ambiguous and lengthy endoscopy may be required to define the anatomy. Nonenhanced magnetic resonance imaging lacks definition of the nondistended common channel and confluence. To our knowledge we introduce 3-dimensional magnetic resonance genitography for delineating the unique anatomical features of these complex anomalies.Contrast genitography, endoscopy and 3-dimensional magnetic resonance genitography were performed preoperatively in 4 female infants with cloacal malformations. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance genitography was performed using a 3-dimensional spoiled gradient technique after the instillation of gadolinium-diethylenetetramine pentaacetic acid solution via the common channel and cutaneous vesicostomy, when present. Augmented pressure distal colostogram with gadolinium via the mucous fistula was included. Three-dimensional images were constructed using a commercially available workstation.Three-dimensional magnetic resonance genitography yielded anatomical information far superior to that of standard genitography in all cases and it provided information on female genital tract anomalies and hindgut confluence that were not fully appreciated at initial endoscopy. The confluence was most accurately represented by augmented pressure colostogram. The length of the common channel was consistent with that on endoscopy. Rotating 3-dimensional images illustrated the unique anatomical relationships. No magnetic resonance imaging specific complications were observed.Three-dimensional magnetic resonance genitography provides superior anatomical detail for the preoperative assessment of cloacal malformations. It augments the information obtained by standard magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvic organs, levators and lumbosacral spine. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance genitography has great potential as a standard for preoperative anatomical evaluation and it will likely simplify preoperative endoscopy rather than supplant it."

The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution investigated the bay throughout the 1950s, identifying duck farming as the cause of ※objectionable§, ※highly contaminated§ conditions of these waters.Much has changed: duck farming declined; the river was dredged to remove polluted sediments, improve navigation; and barrier island inlets stabilized. Yet, the river remains seasonally eutrophic.Why? This paper reviews what occurred in the Forge River watershed. While governments aggressively curtailed the impacts of duck pollution, they failed to manage development and sewage pollution. The Forge experience indicates that watershed management is a continuing governmental responsibility as development accelerates. Otherwise, we will always be looking for that instantaneous remediation that is usually not affordable and is socially contentious."

In these experiments, multiple (10每100) strands of DNA with tetramethyl rhodamine labeled dUMP (TMR-dUMP) incorporated into the sequence were anchored in flow upstream of the detection region of an ultra sensitive flow cytometer. A dilute solution of Exonuclease I passed over the microspheres. When an exonuclease attached to a strand, processive digestion of that strand began. The liberated, labeled bases flowed through the detection region and were detected at high efficiency at the single-molecule level by laser-induced fluorescence. The digestion of a single strand of DNA by a single exonuclease was discernable in these experiments. This result demonstrates the feasibility of single-molecule DNA sequencing. In addition, these experiments point to a new and practical means of arriving at a consensus sequence by individually reading out identical sequences on multiple fragments."
Determinants of Motives for Land Use Decisions at the Margins of the Corn Belt,"Tong Wang, Moses Luri, Larry Janssen, David A.

Our thesis is that the land most responsive to these drivers is at the economic margin between grass-based production and cropping. Much of the eastern Dakotas is such an area, primarily under crop-based agriculture although grass remains an important land use. We surveyed land operators in the area on their views about motivators for land use choices. Their views are largely consistent with the economic margin viewpoint. The importance of crop output prices, crop input prices, innovations in cropping equipment and weather patterns on land use decisions grow as one moves north toward the economic margin. Land in more highly sloped areas is more sensitive to crop prices and crop insurance policies. Consistent with human capital theory, older operators are generally less responsive to factors that affect land use. Those renting more land, being more exposed to market forces, are more responsive. As farm size increases, respondents declared higher land use sensitivity to policy issues and technological innovations, suggesting that scale effects render land units more sensitive to land use change drivers."

Both albitization and albite cements occur in early and late diagenesis. Burial diagenetic origin of albite is supported by: (1) the chemical purity of albite; (2) the growth of euhedral albite on numerous sites of the host feldspar; (3) the continued growth of the replacement albite into adjacent pores; (4) the delicate skeletal texture in partially dissolved areas of albitized feldspar; and (5) the occurrence of ankerite cement inclusions in authigenic albite. Backscattered electron imaging suggests that feldspar albitization occurs in irregular, vein-like and perthite elbite forms. Feldspar albitization is commonly associated with dissolution pores and twins. Backscattered electron imaging suggests that up to 50% of the mean total 4% detrital K-feldspars have been albitized. The volume percentage of feldspar albitization shows no trend with increasing burial depth or temperature. Most of the sandstones have 2每3% albite cement except in a high minus-cement porosity framework where it may exceed 30% of the sandstone."

The aim of this study was to examine the biological effects of immuno-neutralization of inhibin bioactivity in porcine granulosa cells using transcriptome profiling by the RNA-seq technology.Treatment of granulosa cells with anti-inhibin 汐 subunit antibodies increased both cell proliferation and estradiol secretion. Data revealed by RNA sequencing were subjected to bioinformatic analysis. The results showed that a total of 476 genes, including 27 novel genes, were differentially expressed in anti- inhibin antibody-treated granulosa cells compared to untreated granulosa cells. RNA sequencing data were validated by qRT-PCR which confirmed differential expression (upregulation and downregulation) of eighteen of twenty selected genes A total of 476 differentially expressed genes were enriched in processes such as matrix remodeling, chemokine activity, protein binding, and structural molecular activities, and which could be related to granulosa cell proliferation, estradiol synthesis, and ovarian follicle growth. In particular, the data emphasized the importance of extracellular matrix remodeling and the involvement of chemokines in enhanced granulosa cell function, which are important features of ovarian follicle growth, development, maturation, and ovulation. This study provided a new level of understanding of enhanced granulosa cell function and ovarian follicle development achieved through immuno-neutralization of endogenous inhibin bioactivity."
Cropland expansion and grassland loss in the eastern Dakotas: New insights from a farm-level survey,"Michael C. Wimberly, Larry L. Janssen, David A. Hennessy, Moses Luri, Hongli Feng, ","Land Use Policy, Volume 63, April 2017, Pages 160-173, ","The western Corn Belt region of the United States has become a hotspot for agricultural extensification and consequent land use and land cover changes. The goals of this research were to characterize geographic patterns of grassland loss resulting from cropland expansion in the eastern Dakotas, and to understand how these changes were associated with characteristics of individual farms and farm operators. We collected data on grassland conversion and other land use decisions through a mail survey of farm operators in North and South Dakota. Overall, 40% of respondents converted at least some grassland to cropland between 2004 and 2014, and the total acreage of converted grassland was equivalent to 5.1% of the surveyed farm acreage. Although most converted grassland acres (3.2% of farm acreage) were from land enrolled in the conservation reserve program (CRP), there were also substantial amounts of native grassland conversion (1.0%) and tame grassland conversion (0.9%). The total acreage of grassland conversion was more than four times larger than the acreage enrolled in CRP and other conservation programs. Different types of grassland conversion (e.g., native grassland versus CRP) were concentrated in different parts of the study region, and were spatially disjunct from the areas of highest conservation program enrollment. Larger farms were more likely than smaller farms to expand their cropland acreage and accounted for a disproportionate share of grassland conversion. Younger farm operators, higher levels of farm income, higher proportions of rented croplands, and marginal yields were also associated with cropland expansion and grassland conversion. Although CRP and other land retirement programs will remain important policy mechanisms for conservation in this region, they are not sufficient to maintain current levels of grassland cover and do not provide protection for native grasslands. Alternative conservation strategies and new agricultural policies are thus critically needed to maintain the ecosystem services provided by grasslands."

Influence of void defects on partial discharge behavior of superconducting busbar insulation,"Chunyu Wang, Xiongyi Huang, Kun Lu, Guoliang Li, Yuntao Song, ","Fusion Engineering and Design, Volume 119, June 2017, Pages 29-34, ","For a magnetic confinement fusion device, the superconducting magnets and busbars need to be insulated with one layer of solid insulation to isolate the high voltage potential from the ground. The insulation layer commonly consists of several interleaved layers of epoxy resin-impregnated glass fiber tapes and polyimide films. The traditional electrical inspection methods for such solidified insulation on the magnet and busbar are a DC voltage test or a Paschen test. These tests measure the quality of the insulation based on the value of leakage currents. However, even if there is a larger quantity of high dielectric strength material implemented, if there are some microcavities or delaminations in the insulation system, the leakage current may be limited to microampere levels under testing levels over dozens of kilovolts. Therefore, it is difficult to judge the insulation quality just by the magnitudes of leakage current. Under long-term operation, such imperceptible defects will worsen and finally completely break down the insulation because of partial discharge (PD) incidents. Therefore, a PD detection test is an important complement to the DC voltage and Paschen tests for magnet and busbar insulations in the field of fusion.It is known that the PD detection test is a mature technique in the electric power industry. In this paper, the PD characteristics of samples containing glass fiber-reinforced composite insulations for use with the superconducting busbar were presented and discussed. Various samples with different void contents were prepared and the PD behaviors were tested."

To improve the permeability of coal seam, the hydraulic flushing is adopted, so the effect evaluation of stree relief and permeability enhancement will be necessary before gas extraction. In this paper, an electromagnetic radiation (EMR) experiment system of coal seam hydraulic flushing was established, and the EMR characteristics of coal during hydraulic flushing were studied. The EMR test of hydraulic flushing was carried out in the Liangbei coal mine, China, and the gas extraction flow and coal stress were measured simultaneously. And then, the variation laws of EMR and the effect evaluation of hydraulic flushing were analyzed. The results showed that coal deformation and fracture produced abundant EMR signals during hydraulic flushing. The variation of the EMR signals was synchronous with the variation of load, and the large the load variation was, the greater the EMR intensity and count were. Compared with before hydraulic flushing, the EMR signals changed significantly after hydraulic flushing, and the variation amplitude of the EMR intensity was consistent with the variation amplitude of the coal stress and gas extraction flow.

More than 600 charts were reviewed and 99 patients met study criteria. Univariate and mulitvariate logistic regression model analysis were performed comparing the complication rate in the immediate postoperative period to the patients＊ age, gender, mechanism of injury, zone of facial injury, preoperative Glasgow Coma score, presence of multisystem injury, mechanism of TBI and treatment, length of time from injury to surgical repair and length of surgical procedure.Of the 99 individuals studied, there was an 11% complication rate (8 minor, 3 major) in the immediate postoperative period. After univariate analysis, the length of time from injury to surgical repair, zone 1 facial injury and low Glasgow Coma score were all factors associated with increased complications. Multivariate logistic regression model analysis revealed that the odds of a patient sustaining a postoperative complication was 1.298 as the hour of procedure increased by 1 hour (95% CI, 1.065-1.582) and was 1.152 as the days of repair increased by 1 day (95% CI, 1.030-1.288).The overall complication rate of facial fracture repair in the TBI patient was 11%. A prolonged surgical procedure and delay in surgical repair were associated with higher complication rates as identified by multivariate logistical regression analysis."
How accurate is fetal biometry in the assessment of fetal age?,"Frank A. Chervenak, Daniel W. Skupski, Roberto Romero, Mary Kay Myers, Howard T. Thaler, ","American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Volume 178, Issue 4, April 1998, Pages 678-687, ","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to assess the accuracy of fetal biometry in the midtrimester of pregnancy in the assignment of fetal age. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 152 singleton, 67 twin, and 19 triplet gestations resulting from in vitro fertilization with ultrasonographic fetal biometry from 14 to 22 weeks made up the study population. A gestational age prediction equation was derived from singletons with the use of stepwise linear regression. This equation was compared with 38 previously published equations and then applied to the twin and triplet populations. RESULTS: Head circumference was the best predictor of gestational age (random error [SD] 3.77 days). Addition of abdominal circumference and femur length to head circumference improved the accuracy of the dating equation (random error 3.35 days). Most dating formulas had systematic errors of <1 week. The systematic error was 每0.32 day for averaging the singleton-based predictions for twins and 每1.26 days for triplets. CONCLUSIONS: Gestational age assessment with the use of fetal biometry from 14 to 22 weeks is accurate for singleton, twin, and triplet gestations. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;178:678-87.)"
On wave based weak Trefftz discontinuous Galerkin approach for medium-frequency heterogeneous Helmholtz problem,"Hao Li, Pierre Ladev豕ze, Herv谷 Riou, ","Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Volume 328, 1 January 2018, Pages 201-216, ","Medium frequency heterogeneous Helmholtz problem gives rise to severe numerical challenge to Finite Element Method (FEM). An extended Variational Theory of Complex Rays (VTCR) is developed for solving this problem. Since VTCR is kind of Trefftz method, analytic solutions of governing equation need to be known a priori. But this requirement limits the application of VTCR to some specific forms of governing equations. Recently, a new computational method named weak Trefftz discontinuous Galerkin method (WTDG) is proposed to enable hybrid Finite Element method (FEM)/ Variational Theory of Complex Rays (VTCR) strategies to be developed easily in acoustics and vibrations. This hybrid method combines the advantages of FEM and VTCR to solve efficiently low frequency and medium frequency problems. This paper proposes a wave based WTDG for heterogeneous Helmholtz problem. Without knowing analytic solution of governing equation, WTDG method provides a simple and general resolution strategy for medium frequency heterogeneous Helmholtz problem."

Overall, 65.8% of the infants developed ROP to some degree; 81.6% for infants of less than 1000 g birth weight. As expected, ROP incidence and severity were higher in lower birth weight and gestational age categories. Black infants appeared less susceptible to ROP, of all severity categories, than nonblack infants. The timing of retinal vascular events correlated more closely with postconceptional age than with postnatal age, implicating the level of maturity more than postnatal environmental influences in governing the timing of these vascular events. These results include the current incidence of various severity stages of ROP found in the United States and provide new. insight into the development of ROP."

It is indicated from the analysis results that the CO2 heat pump heating system reduced the total costs about 120% compared with the coal boiler system, 26% compared with the natural gas boiler system. The amount of CO2 emission of coal boiler system is about 5.3 times as large as CO2 heat pump system, about 6.5 times as large as the natural gas boiler system. Replacing coal boiler heating system with CO2 heat pump system is economically and environmentally feasible in China where natural gas resources are not rich."
Crystal Structure of the Human tRNA m1A58 Methyltransferase每tRNA3Lys Complex: Refolding of Substrate tRNA Allows Access to the Methylation Target,"Janet Finer-Moore, Nadine Czudnochowski, Joseph D. O'Connell, Amy Liya Wang, Robert M. Stroud, ","Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 427, Issue 24, 4 December 2015, Pages 3862-3876, ","Human tRNA3Lys is the primer for reverse transcription of HIV; the 3∩ end is complementary to the primer-binding site on HIV RNA. The complementarity ends at the 18th base, A58, which in tRNA3Lys is modified to remove Watson每Crick pairing. Motivated to test the role of the modification in terminating the primer-binding sequence and thus limiting run-on transcription, we asked how the modification of RNA could be accomplished. tRNA m1A58 methyltransferase (m1A58 MTase) methylates N1 of A58, which is buried in the T朵C-loop of tRNA, from cofactor S-adenosyl-l-methionine. This conserved tRNA modification is essential for stability of initiator tRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Reported here, three structures of human tRNA m1A58 MTase in complex with human tRNA3Lys and the product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine show a dimer of heterodimers in which each heterodimer comprises a catalytic chain, Trm61, and a homologous but noncatalytic chain, Trm6, repurposed as a tRNA-binding subunit that acts in trans; tRNAs bind across the dimer interface such that Trm6 from the opposing heterodimer brings A58 into the active site of Trm61. T-loop and D-loop are splayed apart showing how A58, normally buried in tRNA, becomes accessible for modification. This result has broad impact on our understanding of the mechanisms of modifying internal sites in folded tRNA. The structures serve as templates for design of inhibitors that could be used to test tRNA m1A58 MTase's impact on retroviral priming and transcription.Download high-res image (149KB)Download full-size image"

Two-tier land tenure system and sustained economic growth in post-1978 rural China,"Xiao-Yuan Dong, ","World Development, Volume 24, Issue 5, May 1996, Pages 915-928, ","The two-tier land tenure system has been widely blamed for the problems in land allocation and in land-specific investment observed in the postreform rural China. Greater privatization of property rights in land has been proposed to enable productive farmers to acquire more land, to promote land circulation, to improve farmers' access to credit, and to encourage farm investment. It is argued here that in the presence of multiple market distortions, land privatization is unlikely to provide a solution to the agricultural problems. Rather, an approach which refines the existing framework of the two-tier ownership system offers more promise."

In the present study, the diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in 15 samples from the guts and related aquaculture environments (water and sediment) of shrimp were investigated. In total, 60 ARGs, 102 ARGs and 67 ARGs primarily belonging to 13, 15 and 15 different types were detected in the shrimp gut, pond water and sediment samples, respectively. Efflux pump and target modification were the predominant resistance mechanisms in all samples. It was found that Aeromonas, Yersinia and Clostridium XlVb were significantly correlated with the distribution of the ARGs. Besides, the relative abundance of ARGs was positively correlated with the levels of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Moreover, variation partitioning analysis showed that MGEs, contributing to 74.46% of the resistome variation, played an important role in the affecting of the antibiotic resistome than the bacterial communities and their joint effects. Collectively, this study provides comprehensive information to better understand the ARG dissemination in aquaculture environments and to improve the ecological management of aquatic ecosystems."

Earthquake input for finite element analysis of soil-structure interaction on rigid bedrock,"Yang Li, Mi Zhao, Cheng-shun Xu, Xiu-li Du, Zheng Li, ","Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, Volume 79, September 2018, Pages 250-262, ","When using the finite element method to analyze seismic soil-structure interaction (SSI) problem on rigid bedrock, several methods have been developed to input earthquake on the lateral boundary of finite element model. These boundary conditions include the free boundary, the viscous-spring (VS) boundary, the tied degrees of freedom (TDOF) boundary and the free-field loading combined viscous-spring (FFL-VS) boundary. Their accuracy and location should be investigated. In this paper, the formulations and ABAQUS implementations of these boundaries are given. The accuracy properties of these boundaries are then compared by numerical examples including the free-field and SSI problems. The comparison studies indicate that the free and VS boundaries failed to reproduce the free-field and SSI responses when a relatively small size SSI model is employed. The TDOF and FFL-VS boundaries can simulate the exact free-field response and have good performances in seismic SSI analyses. The FFL-VS boundary is more accurate than the TDOF boundary. The appropriate locations for the TDOF and FFL-VS boundaries depend on the SSI model. A simplified approach is developed for appropriate boundary location. This approach is applicable to the FFL-VS boundary but not to the TDOF boundary due to the former more accurate than the latter."
Concrete piezoceramic smart module pairs-based damage diagnosis of hydraulic structure,"Huaizhi Su, Nan Zhang, Hao Li, ","Composite Structures, Volume 183, 1 January 2018, Pages 582-593, ","As a main reaction on the ageing behavior of hydraulic concrete structure, the structural damage is harm to structural safety. With the dynamic damage experiment of concrete gravity dam model under ambient excitation, a concrete piezoceramic smart module (CPSM) pairs-based approach is studied to implement the dynamic characteristics identification and damage diagnosis of hydraulic structure. Based on the piezoelectric coupling property and elastic-plastic contact property of CPSM, which are analyzed by use of numerical simulation software, the optimal shape of CPSM is given. A self-made CPSM-based monitoring platform is developed to obtain the information on structural damage. A wavelet packet decomposition method of CPSM signal is introduced. By analyzing the relation between CPSM signal amplitude and wavelet packet node energy, an index, which is defined with wavelet packet node energy, is proposed to describe the structural damage. The dynamic experimental result shows that above defined index changes obviously with the structural developing damage, and can well reflect the structural damage status. The feasibility and effectiveness of self-made CPSM-based approach are verified to identify the dynamic characteristics and diagnose the hidden damage for hydraulic structure."

Ellis, ","Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Volume 95, Issue 1, Supplement, January 2014, Pages s66-s73, ","This article describes challenges encountered and lessons learned in an effort to explore the black box of rehabilitation. A multidisciplinary team created detailed, mutually exclusive operational definitions for the contents of learning-based treatments administered in a brain injury unit. The function and activity levels of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health were used to organize content definitions, which included examples of therapy activities and therapist behaviors, such as cues. Pairs of trained coders independently identified defined learning episodes within each minute of 128 videotaped physical, occupational, or speech therapy sessions. Interrater agreement was generally acceptable and did not vary by discipline of session, discipline of coder, or whether coders were clinically trained. Disagreements typically involved the threshold for determining that a learning episode had occurred, or deciding between function and activity codes where the surface content of the sessions were similar. The focus on individual therapy sessions allowed for rich qualitative detail, but a less granular analysis will be necessary for comprehensive efforts to characterize the contents of therapy."

To theoretically analyze the performance of this system, expressions of the power output and the conversion efficiency of the thermophotovoltaic cell driven by the automobile exhaust are derived analytically. The optimal functions of the temperature distributions of the automobile exhaust pipe and TPVC are obtained by the variational method and the modified Lagrangian formulation. The maximum power output is calculated. The performance characteristics of the whole system at the maximum power output are represented. The optimal regions of the voltage output of the PV cell, the energy gap of the material in the PV cell, and the inlet heat flow of the gas pipe are determined. The effects of the size of the gas pipe on the performance of the TPVC are discussed. The theoretical efficiencies of the TPVC and thermoelectric generator driven by the automobile exhaust are compared. The advantages of the TPVC are revealed. The results obtained show that the optimally designed TPVC can significantly harvest the waste heat of the automobile exhaust."

Such an integration must be able to support complex authorization specifications and the fine-grained integration requirements that the various parties may have. In this paper, we introduce an algebra for fine-grained integration of sophisticated policies. The algebra, which consists of three binary and two unary operations, is able to support the specification of a large variety of integration constraints. For ease of use, we also introduce a set of derived operators and provide guidelines for users to edit a policy with desired properties. To assess the expressive power of our algebra, we define notion of completeness and prove that our algebra is complete and minimal with respect to the notion. We then propose a framework that uses the algebra for the fine-grained integration of policies expressed in XACML. We also present a methodology for generating the actual integrated XACML policy, based on the notion of Multi-Terminal Binary Decision Diagrams. Experimental results have demonstrated both effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. In addition, we also discuss issues regarding obligations."
Selection of optimal threshold to construct recurrence plot for structural operational vibration measurements,"Dong Yang, Wei-Xin Ren, Yi-Ding Hu, Dan Li, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, Volume 349, 4 August 2015, Pages 361-374, ",The structural health monitoring (SHM) involves the sampled operational vibration measurements over time so that the structural features can be extracted accordingly. The recurrence plot (RP) and corresponding recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) have become a useful tool in various fields due to its efficiency. The threshold selection is one of key issues to make sure that the constructed recurrence plot contains enough recurrence points. Different signals have in nature different threshold values. This paper is aiming at presenting an approach to determine the optimal threshold for the operational vibration measurements of civil engineering structures. The surrogate technique and Taguchi loss function are proposed to generate reliable data and to achieve the optimal discrimination power point where the threshold is optimum. The impact of selecting recurrence thresholds on different signals is discussed. It is demonstrated that the proposed method to identify the optimal threshold is applicable to the operational vibration measurements. The proposed method provides a way to find the optimal threshold for the best RP construction of structural vibration measurements under operational conditions.

These two lithological units are generally only a few meters thick but each spans an interval of the Nemagraptus gracilis Biozone (ca. 3每4 My). Accordingly, they are condensed sequences. The Datianba Formation, which consists of thin-bedded limestones containing a shelly fauna, was formed in a shallow, oxic setting on the outer-shelf. The Miaopo Formation shales are limited to depressions surrounded by the Datianba Formation, indicating the sporadic occurrence of anoxic marine environments on the sea floor. The Miaopo Formation contains a high-diversity, abundant benthic fauna in addition to planktonic graptolites. The presence of tube-shaped burrows within the Miaopo Formation further indicates an oxic sea floor favorable for survival of benthic fauna. These results indicate that during deposition of the two formations the sea floor was mainly oxic. During deposition of the Datianba and Miaopo formations, the sea floor was a relatively gentle ramp without steep slopes. The distinct facies of the Miaopo and Datianba formations are interfingered."

Based on above object representation and its weight map, our tracker searches the local region with the maximum similarity in coarse-to-fine way. In addition, we introduce a visual attention knowledge that the object, namely foreground, should be always located in the center of the weight map, to handle the model drift problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed tracking method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in challenging scenarios and our tracker is especially insensitive to the location of the initial box."

Weese, ","Journal of Surgical Research, Volume 48, Issue 4, April 1990, Pages 337-340, ","Photodynamic therapy was investigated as a potential new modality for the treatment of human malignant mesothelioma (HMM) utilizing the H-MESO-1 HMM cell line and the photosensitizing agent, Photofrin-II (PF-II). Uptake of PF-II by H-MESO-1 was documented by incubating H-MESO-1 cells with PF-II and measuring the fluorescence at 625 nm following excitation at 400 nm. Cytotoxicity of photodynamic therapy was determined by incubating H-MESO-1 cells (2 ℅ 105) in microtiter plates for 24 hr with concentrations of PF-II varying from 0 to 10 pg/ml. The wells were exposed to gold vapor laser light (628 nm) in doses ranging from 0 to 24,000 J/m2. Twenty-four hours following treatment, [3h]thymidine (1 米Ci) was added to each well. Cells were harvested 24 hr later and counted for tritium incorporation. Five replicates were performed for each combination of light and drug. Peak absorption of PF-II by HMESO-1 was reached within 8 hr. Maximal doses of light alone caused minimal cell killing. PF-II without light was cytotoxic only at the highest concentrations. However, the combination of PF-II at concentrations at or above 2.5 米g/ml and light produced a significant increase in cytotoxicity. These data demonstrate that photodynamic therapy can effectively kill human malignant mesothelioma cells in vitro."
IMPACT: A twin-index framework for efficient moving object query processing,"Bin Cui, Dan Lin, Kian-Lee Tan, ","Data & Knowledge Engineering, Volume 59, Issue 1, October 2006, Pages 63-85, ","With the rapid advancement in wireless communications and positioning techniques, it is now feasible to track the positions of moving objects. However, existing indexes and associated algorithms, which are usually disk-based, are unable to keep up with the high update rate while providing speedy retrieval at the same time. Since main memory is much faster than disk, efficient management of moving-object database can be achieved through aggressive use of main memory. In this paper, we propose an integrated memory partitioning and activity conscious twin-index (IMPACT) framework where the moving object database is indexed by a pair of indexes based on the properties of the objects＊ movement〞a main-memory structure manages active objects while a disk-based index handles inactive objects. As objects become active (or inactive), they dynamically migrate from one structure to the other. In the worst case that each time an object need to be migrated to the disk, which means each update may incur a disk access, the performance of IMPACT degrades to be the same as the disk-based index structures. Moreover, the main memory is also organized into two partitions〞one for the main memory index, and the other as buffers for the frequently accessed nodes of the disk-based index. We also presented the detailed algorithms for different operations and a cost model to estimate the optimal memory allocation. Our analytical and experimental results show that the proposed IMPACT framework achieves significant performance improvement over the traditional indexing scheme."
An integrated dynamic performance measurement system for improving manufacturing competitiveness,"Alaa M. Ghalayini, James S. Noble, Thomas J. Crowe, ","International Journal of Production Economics, Volume 48, Issue 3, 14 February 1997, Pages 207-225, ","Until the 1980s manufacturing companies relied solely on performance measurement systems based on traditional cost accounting systems to control, monitor, and improve their operations. However, it has been shown that these systems do not capture the relevant performance issues for today's manufacturing environment. Rather, they focus on monitoring and controlling versus supporting process improvement, promoting overall system optimization, and addressing the dynamics of changing systems. In order to overcome the limitations of the traditional performance measurement systems a variety of integrated systems have been proposed. However, these systems have not yet fully addressed the requirements of a performance measurement system for today's manufacturing environment.This paper presents an integrated dynamic performance measurement system (IDPMS) developed in conjunction with the Missouri Plant of Square D Company. The IDPMS integrates three main areas of the company: management, process improvement team, and factory shop floor. To achieve an integrated system, the three areas are linked through the specification, reporting and dynamic updating of the defined areas of success, performance measures, and performance standards. Three tools are incorporated to support and enhance the integration within the IDPMS. An example is given that illustrates how the IDPMS addresses the current requirements of a performance measurement system."
Dynamics analysis and design methodology of roll-resistant hydraulically interconnected suspensions for tri-axle straight trucks,"Fei Ding, Nong Zhang, Jie Liu, Xu Han, ","Journal of the Franklin Institute, Volume 353, Issue 17, November 2016, Pages 4620-4651, ","A new hydraulically interconnected suspension (HIS) system is proposed to enhance the roll dynamics of the tri-axle straight trucks. The impedance of the hydraulic system is derived with impedance transfer matrix method, and integrated to establish the equations of motion of the mechanical and hydraulic coupling system. Based on the obtained equations, the additional mode stiffness/damping of the vehicle body and wheel state forces are explicitly described with the physical parameters of the hydraulic system. The obtained results indicate that the proposed HIS system can be able to independently enhance the mode stiffness/damping, in which the additional bounce/pitch and roll/warp mode stiffness are determined by the difference and summation of the top and the corresponding bottom piston surface area, respectively. The mode damping is caused by the direction and roll damper valves, simultaneously. The later valves alter the mode damping like the accumulators change the mode stiffness. The comparison of dynamic responses between the trucks with the conventional suspension and the HIS system shows that the HIS system can effectively suppress the roll motion of the truck body and favorably reduce the warp mode force for the wheel stations. Finally, the loss coefficients of the damper valves are tuned in terms of dimensionless factors to handle the compromising indices based on the dynamic responses."

Responses of the male golden hamster to mixtures of odorants identified from vaginal discharge,"Robert J. O'Connell, Alan G. Singer, Foteos Macrides, Carl Pfaffmann, William C. Agosta, ","Behavioral Biology, Volume 24, Issue 2, October 1978, Pages 244-255, ","A series of aliphatic acids and alcohols was isolated and identified from hamster vaginal discharge. These materials along with a previously identified hamster attractant pheromone, dimethyl disulfide, were assayed in amounts characteristic of a single female collection for their ability to attract normal males and to promote copulatory behavior toward female surrogates. Estrous hamster vaginal discharge attracted normal males and stimulated copulatory attempts toward scented surrogates. Male copulatory behavior was unmodified by: dimethyl disulfide, the aliphatic acids, the aliphatic alcohols or a grand mixture of all these identified components of vaginal discharge. Therefore there must be some, as yet unidentified, material in vaginal discharge which induces normal males to engage in copulatory behavior. Neither the acids nor the alcohols when presented as mixtures had significant effects on male attraction. The attractiveness of a grand mixture of dimethyl disulfide and the series of aliphatic acids and alcohols was comparable to the attractiveness of dimethyl disulfide alone. Thus, the presence of small amounts of dimethyl disulfide can account for much of the ability of whole vaginal discharge to attract males to the odor source even when this compound is assayed in the presence of large amounts of inactive biological odorants."

Both resins are easily processed into shaped and void-free components. The polymers and corresponding pyrolysates exhibit outstanding thermal properties. As the heat treatment is progressively increased, a carbonaceous mass is produced yielding a high char yield. As the pyrolysis temperature was raised to 700∼C, the density increased and remained at a fairly constant value to 1200∼C. Further heat treatment to 2700∼C resulted in a reduction in the density. Shrinkage appears to occur at about the same rate as free volume is being produced within the developing pyrolysates causing collapse to essentially microporous systems."
IFN-污 Induces Gastric Cancer Cell Proliferation and Metastasis Through Upregulation of Integrin 汕3-Mediated NF-百B Signaling,"Yuan-Hua Xu, Zheng-Li Li, Sheng-Feng Qiu, ","Translational Oncology, Volume 11, Issue 1, February 2018, Pages 182-192, ","Interferon 污 (IFN-污), a multifunctional cytokine, was upregulated in the resected gastric cancer tissue. However, whether IFN-污 is involved in the regulation of gastric cancer has not been well elucidated. Herein, we aimed to investigate the effects and mechanism of IFN-污 on gastric cancer. In this study, we found a vital role of IFN-污 in enhancing proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis, and promoting cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer cells SGC-7901 and MGC-803. Additionally, IFN-污 activated nuclear factor 百B (NF-百B) signaling pathway by upregulating the phosphorylation expression of p65 and I百B汐, and induced the expression of integrin 汕3 in vitro. Therefore, to further investigate the relationship between IFN-污 and integrin 汕3, SGC-7901 cells were transfected with integrin 汕3 siRNA. And then cells expressed lower cell viability, migration, and invasion rates, while cell apoptosis was significantly enhanced. Meanwhile, expression of integrin 汕3, MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-百B, including p65 and I百B汐, and the nuclear translocation of NF-百B/p65 were dramatically repressed, whereas IFN-污 significantly improved the effects. Moreover, in vivo, the experiment of xenograft model and pulmonary metastasis model also retarded in integrin 汕3 siRNA group. And the expression of integrin 汕3, MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-百B was repressed. However, the treatment with IFN-污 improved tumor volume, lung/total weight, tumor nodules, and the protein expression described above compared with integrin 汕3 siRNA group. Overall, the results indicated that IFN-污 induces gastric cancer cell proliferation and metastasis partially through the upregulation of integrin 汕3-mediated NF-百B signaling. Hence, the inhibition of IFN-污 or integrin 汕3 may be the key for the treatment of gastric cancer."
N-2-Mercaptopropionylglycine improves recovery of myocardial function after reversible regional ischemia,"Mary Lee Myers, Roberto Bolli, Raymond F. Lekich, Craig J. Hartley, Robert Roberts, ","Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Volume 8, Issue 5, November 1986, Pages 1161-1168, ","Myocardial reperfusion after reversible regional ischemia is known to result in delayed recovery of contractile function, but the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon remains unclear. We examined the ability of N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine, a synthetic thiol compound with oxygen free radical scavenging properties, to attenuate postischemic dysfunction in open chest dogs undergoing a 15 minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 4 hours of re-perfusion. Treated animals received an infusion of N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine (50 mg/kg per h) for 4 hours starting 15 minutes before coronary occlusion. Collateral flow, as determined with radioactive microspheres after 10 minutes of ischemia, was 0.07 ㊣ 0.01 ml/min per g (mean ㊣ SE) in both control (n = 20) and treated (n = 13) groups. The occluded vascular bed, as determined by postmortem perfusion, averaged 26.1 ㊣ 1.2% of the weight of the left ventricle in control and 29.6 ㊣ 1.3% in treated animals.Systolic wall thickening (an index of regional function) was assessed with an epicardial pulsed Doppler probe. The two groups exhibited comparable systolic thickening under baseline conditions and similar degrees of dyskinesia during ischemia. Nevertheless, recovery of function (expressed as percent of baseline) was considerably greater in the treated dogs at 1 hour (44.6 versus 12.8%, p = 0.05), 2 hours (64.0 versus 31.6%, p < 0.02), 3 hours (77.1 versus 36.7%, p < 0.01) and 4 hours of reperfusion (75.0 versus 40.0%, p < 0.05).Thus, N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine produced a significant and sustained improvement in recovery of contractile function after a brief episode of regional myocardial ischemia. These results suggest that oxygen free radicals play a significant role in myocardial postishemic dysfunction. Because N-2-mercaptopropionylgly-cine is potentially available for oral prophylactic therapy, these results have significant therapeutic implications."

Near minimum-time feedback attitude control with multiple saturation constraints for agile satellites,"Xiangdong Liu, Xing Xin, Zhen Li, Zhen Chen, Yongzhi Sheng, ","Chinese Journal of Aeronautics, Volume 29, Issue 3, June 2016, Pages 722-737, ","Agile satellites are of importance in modern aerospace applications, but high mobility of the satellites may cause them vulnerable to saturation during attitude maneuvers due to limited rating of actuators. This paper proposes a near minimum-time feedback control law for the agile satellite attitude control system. The feedback controller is formed by specially designed cascaded sub-units. The rapid dynamic response of the modified Bang每Bang control logic achieves the near optimal property and ensures the non-saturation properties on three-axis. To improve the dynamic performance, a model reference control strategy is proposed, in which the on-line near optimal attitude maneuver path is generated by the cascade controller and is then tracked by a nonlinear back-stepping controller. Furthermore, the accuracy and the robustness of the control system are achieved by momentum-based on-line inertial identification. The rapid attitude maneuvering can be applied for tasks including the move to move case. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in terms of the saturation-free property and rapidness."

Ultrasonic assisted direct contact membrane distillation hybrid process for membrane scaling mitigation,"Deyin Hou, Zhangxin Wang, Guoliang Li, Hua Fan, Hongjing Huang, ","Desalination, Volume 375, 2 November 2015, Pages 33-39, ","A novel ultrasonic assisted direct contact membrane distillation hybrid process was designed and the effect of ultrasonic irradiation on membrane scaling mitigation during membrane distillation process was investigated. Under ultrasonic irradiation, ultrasonic wave refreshed the liquid-membrane interface continuously and reduced concentration polarization in the boundary layer adjacent to membrane surface simultaneously. Therefore, ultrasonic irradiation could mitigate membrane scaling caused by CaSO4 and prevented the permeate flux decline. Although the ultrasonic irradiation could restrain the crystal size of CaCO3 deposits and clean membrane surface, the experimental results demonstrated that it was not necessary to introduce ultrasonic irradiation into membrane distillation process for CaCO3 membrane scaling mitigation. Due to fast precipitation rate, the concentration of CaCO3 solution would not cause notable permeate flux decline in the absence of ultrasonic irradiation. There would be a gradual permeate flux decline during the concentration process of silica solution because of the formation and deposition of colloidal polysilicic acid on membrane surface. The ultrasonic irradiation caused the zeta potential of silica colloids to approach neutral and enhanced the tendency of colloid deposit, but the membrane surface could be effectively kept clean and the permeate flux was hardly affected by concentration factor increasing.Download full-size image"

Sherwood, Hao Li, Kathleen Kuman, Chaorong Li, ","Quaternary International, Volume 480, 30 June 2018, Pages 141-151, ","The East Asian Acheulean is often considered distinct from African and European Acheulean technologies as large cutting tools (LCTs) are thicker and heavier on average. This distinction is generally true, but exceptions occur, particularly in thickness, as more Chinese sites are reported. It has been suggested that the raw materials available in East Asia have played a part in determining this dissimilarity. Extensive raw material studies on East Asian technologies have not yet been done to determine if this is indeed the case. It is thus important to investigate the impact of raw materials quality on the East Asian Acheulean. This paper focuses on raw material attributes for LCTs from the Danjiangkou Reservoir Region, central China (DRR), with specific focus on Middle Pleistocene artefacts from Terrace 3 of the Han River. Extensive experimental studies were done to determine raw material attributes and how those attributes affect the knapping process in the creation of LCTs. A set of variables was recorded for the experimental tools and compared with a sample of archaeological LCTs. The variables recorded included: the impurity encounter rates of various raw materials, their weathering states, grain sizes and shapes. The results indicated that hominids occupying the DRR exhibited selective behaviours for the raw materials they used to make LCTs, despite not having a wide variety of materials from which to select. It is also evident that they showed adaptability and made strategic decisions with regards to the selected raw materials for manufacture of LCTs to meet their needs."

Directed self-assembly of inorganic redox complexes with artificial peptide scaffolds,"Carl P.

This review focuses on the use of artificial peptide strands to assemble inorganic complexes that are redox active. These approaches toward macromolecular assembly use varying oligoamide backbones and assembly motifs that grew from earlier reports of single oligolysine or proline chains containing pendant redox species that undergo photoinduced charge separation. Recently, peptide nucleic acid chains that form double-stranded duplexes analogous to DNA by hydrogen bonding of complementary base pairs have been modified to contain metal complexes. In these structures, hydrogen bonding and metal coordination combine to form crosslinks between the PNA strands. Finally, a family of structures is described that is based on an aminoethylglycine scaffold with pendant metal coordination sites, but without intervening nucleic acid base pairs. These structures form multimetallic complexes that are either single- or double-stranded, or that form hairpin loop structures. These motifs for using artificial peptide strands for self-assembly hold electron donors and acceptors in relative positions that provide structural connectivity and permit electron transfers between linked metal complexes. This is a new approach for creating polyfunctional redox architectures that could ultimately enable the construction of potentially large and complex molecular electronics devices."

Pheromone concentration in hamster vaginal discharge (HVD) is maximum on Day 1, at the time of ovulation (320 ng DMDS/g of HVD), falls on Day 2 (227 ng/g), is minimal on Day 3 (78 ng/g), and then begins to rise on Day 4 (147 ng/g). The largest total amount of DMDS (5.6 米g) is present in the vagina on Day 2, the day on which the maximum HVD collection is obtained. However the peak in the cycle of DMDS concentration leads the peak in the amount of HVD collected by 1 and sometimes by 2 cycle days. There is sufficient DMDS present each day in the female's vagina to account for her persistant attractiveness to males in the typical laboratory bioassay."
"Prolactin, a potential mediator of reduced social interactive behavior in newborn infants following maternal perinatal depressive symptoms","Huiping Zhang, Qian Su, Dan Yao, Shan Wang, Hui Li, ","Journal of Affective Disorders, Volume 215, June 2017, Pages 274-280, ","The hormone prolactin (PRL) plays a crucial role for the initiation and maintenance of maternal behavior, and is also associated with the etiology of mood disorders in women, especially for depression. The present study aimed to determine whether maternal peripheral prolactin would be associated with newborn behavior disorders following maternal perinatal depressive symptoms, and further to explore the efficacy of the Newborn Behavioral Observations (NBO) in improving newborn social interactive behavior.Interview and the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) were used to assess the hospitalized pregnant women waiting for delivery at 37-42weeks of gestation. A total of 255 subjects were recruited, diagnosed with depression (n=135), and control group (n=120). Within 2 weeks postpartum, mothers were asked to fill with Maternal Attachment Inventory (MAI) to measure maternal care. Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) were used to evaluate newborn behavior. The depressed mother-newborns dyad was randomly assigned to NBO intervention and control group. Serum prolaction in mothers and cortisol in mothers and newborns were measured.The newborns of mothers exposed to maternal perinatal depressive symptoms displayed the reduced newborn social interactive behavior accompanied by decreased maternal serum PRL as well as increased maternal and neonatal serum cortisol. The NBO could be an effective intervention tool.Our study could not be double-blind. The mothers knew which group their infant were in.Maternal peripheral PRL had the potential to be a mediator in reduced social interactive behavior in newborn infants following maternal perinatal depressive symptoms."
A variational data assimilation system for nearshore applications of SWAN,"Jayaram Veeramony, David Walker, Larry Hsu, ","Ocean Modelling, Volume 35, Issue 3, 2010, Pages 206-214, ","This paper uses the variational approach described by Walker (2006) for assimilation of data into the nearshore spectral wave model SWAN. The system uses observed two-dimensional spectra from the interior of the domain to correct the prescribed boundary conditions for the forward model. The objective function that determines the amount of correction to be applied is derived with the assumption that the differences between observations and model predictions are mainly a result of specification of incorrect spectra at the boundary. Using synthetic data, we show that the system reproduces the correct wave spectra at the boundary and converges to the solution with accuracy greater than 95% in only a few model iterations. Use of the assimilation system to estimate the wave field is demonstrated for Santa Rosa Island, FL. Results show excellent agreement with independent observations of the bulk (or integrated) wave parameters such as significant wave heights, peak wave periods and mean wave directions, and good agreement with observations of the two-dimensional wave spectra. The accuracy of the system is reduced when there is relatively little energy at the assimilation location or when the nonlinear processes due to wind (such as active wave growth, nonlinear transfer of energy between frequencies and directions, and breaking) are dominant in the region of interest."

The geometries of the modeled tunnel and the subway train are partially based on those of the Seoul subway. The effects of the structure of the ventilation duct and the geometry of the partitions on the ventilation performance are evaluated.

When modeling the rotor, the oil-film supports are considered as its dynamic load boundary conditions. Consequently, the identification of oil-film coefficients is first converted to the reconstruction of equivalent dynamic loads. Through Green's function method and regularization, the equivalent dynamic oil-film loads can be steadily and precisely reconstructed. Then, according to the mechanical relationships between the oil-film properties and the corresponding equivalent loads, the oil-film stiffness and damping coefficients are identified using least square scheme. A rotor structure with two journal bearings is investigated and the identification results of oil-film coefficients demonstrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed method."

肋3-Polyunsaturated fatty acids for heart failure: Effects of dose on efficacy and novel signaling through free fatty acid receptor 4,"Timothy D. O'Connell, Robert C. Block, Shue P. Huang, Gregory C. Shearer, ","Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology, Volume 103, February 2017, Pages 74-92, ","Heart failure (HF) affects 5.7 million in the U.S., and despite well-established pharmacologic therapy, the 5-year mortality rate remains near 50%. Furthermore, the mortality rate for HF has not declined in years, highlighting the need for new therapeutic options. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (肋3-PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are important regulators of cardiovascular health. However, questions of efficacy and mechanism of action have made the use of 肋3-PUFAs in all cardiovascular disease (CVD) controversial. Here, we review recent studies in animal models of HF indicating that 肋3-PUFAs, particularly EPA, are cardioprotective, with the results indicating a threshold for efficacy. We also examine clinical studies suggesting that 肋3-PUFAs improve outcomes in patients with HF. Due to the relatively small number of clinical studies of 肋3-PUFAs in HF, we discuss EPA concentration-dependency on outcomes in clinical trials of CVD to gain insight into the perceived questionable efficacy of 肋3-PUFAs clinically, with the results again indicating a threshold for efficacy. Ultimately, we suggest that the main failing of 肋3-PUFAs in clinical trials might be a failure to reach a therapeutically effective concentration. We also examine mechanistic studies suggesting that 肋3-PUFAs signal through free fatty acid receptor 4 (Ffar4), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) for long-chain fatty acids (FA), thereby identifying an entirely novel mechanism of action for 肋3-PUFA mediated cardioprotection. Finally, based on mechanistic animal studies suggesting that EPA prevents interstitial fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction, we speculate about a potential benefit for EPA-Ffar4 signaling in heart failure preserved with ejection fraction.Download high-res image (142KB)Download full-size image"
Nano-engineered intrapores in nanoparticles of PtNi networks for increased oxygen reduction reaction activity,"Jieting Ding, Shan Ji, Hui Wang, Julian Key, Rongfang Wang, ","Journal of Power Sources, Volume 374, 15 January 2018, Pages 48-54, ","Network-like metallic alloys of solid nanoparticles have been frequently reported as promising electrocatalysts for fuel cells. The three-dimensional structure of such networks is rich in pores in the form of voids between nanoparticles, which collectively expose a large surface area for catalytic activity. Herein, we present a novel solution to this problem using a precursor comprising a flocculent core-shell PtNi@Ni to produce PtNi network catalysts with nanoparticle intraporosity after carefully controlled electrochemical dealloying. Physical characterization shows a hierarchical level of nanoporosity (intrapores within nanoparticles and pores between them) evolves during the controlled electrochemical dealloying, and that a Pt-rich surface also forms after 22 cycles of Ni leaching. In ORR cycling, the PtNi networks gain 4-fold activity in both jECSA and jmass over a state of the art Pt/C electrocatalyst, and also significantly exceed previously reported PtNi networks. In ORR degradation tests, the PtNi networks also proved stable, dropping by 30.4% and 62.6% in jECSA and jmass respectively. The enhanced performance of the catalyst is evident, and we also propose that the presented synthesis procedure can be generally applied to developing other metallic networks.Download high-res image (287KB)Download full-size image"
Wind tunnel simulation of pollutant dispersion inside street canyons with galleries and multi-level flat roofs,"Yuan-dong HUANG, Ning-bin ZENG, Ze-yu LIU, Ye SONG, Xuan XU, ","Journal of Hydrodynamics, Ser. B, Volume 28, Issue 5, October 2016, Pages 801-810, ","In this study, the pollutant dispersion within street canyons is studied by experiments conducted in an environmental wind tunnel. The vehicular exhaust emissions are modeled using a line source. The pollutant (smoke) concentrations inside the canyons are measured based on a light scattering technique. The pollutant concentrations within the four different street canyons containing the galleries and the three-level flat-roofs under both the isolated and urban environments are obtained and discussed. For each of the four canyon configurations investigated, it is found that there is an obvious discrepancy between the pollutant dispersion patterns under the isolated environment and the urban environment. The three-level flat roof is found to significantly influence the pollutant distribution pattern in a street canyon. In order to clarify the impacts of the wedge-shaped roofs on the pollutant dispersion inside an urban street canyon of an aspect ratio of 1.0, the pollutant distributions inside urban street canyons of three different wedge-shaped roof combinations are measured and analyzed. It is revealed that the pollutant distribution pattern inside the urban street canyon of an aspect ratio of 1.0 is influenced greatly by the wedge-shaped roof, especially, when an upward wedge-shaped roof is placed on the upstream building of the canyon. Images from this study may be utilized for a rough evaluation of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models and for helping architects and urban planners to select the canyon configurations with a minimum negative impact on the local air quality."
Numerical investigation of coupled mass transport and electrochemical reactions in porous SOFC anode microstructure,"Han Xu, Zheng Dang, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 109, June 2017, Pages 1252-1260, ","To investigate the coupled mass transport and electrochemical reactions in porous anode of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), a pore scale model employing the multi-component Lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for mass transport in the pore phase and a six-step reaction for electrochemical reactions at three phase boundaries is established. This model is superior in including the effects of heterogeneity of anode microstructure, making it qualified to quantitatively simulate local distributions of various physical fields without dependence on any statistical parameters. The characteristics of coupled interactions of mass transport and electrochemical reaction are analyzed visually by comparing H2 molar fraction distributions within the pore phase of the anode. It is demonstrated that, for anodes with different heterogeneous microstructures but with same porosity and tortuosity factor, the mass transport and electrochemical reaction process can be quite different, even under the same boundary conditions. Meanwhile, based on the same anode microstructure, species molar fraction varies similarly along the primary transport direction, even though the operating conditions are quite different. Besides, the influences of fuel composition, activation overpotential and operating temperature are also discussed at pore scale by the present model.Download high-res image (300KB)Download full-size image"
Effect of trilinolein on the activity and gene expression of superoxide dismutase in cultured rat brain astrocytes,"Wen-Ta Chiu, Paul Chan, Shue-Sen Liao, Jyh-Ren Liou, Juei-Tang Cheng, ","Neuroscience Letters, Volume 269, Issue 1, 2 July 1999, Pages 17-20, ","Cerebrovascular disease is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in recent. Oxygen free radicals produced during cerebral infarction increases the damage to neurons. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is the endogenous antioxidant enzyme that can effectively scavenge superoxide radicals. Trilinolein is a lipophilic antioxidant purified from the herb of Panax pseudoginseng. In the cultured rat brain astrocytes (RBA), the activity of SOD (both Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD subtypes) was markedly increased by incubation with trilinolein at low concentration (0.1 米M) for 2 days. This stimulatory effect of trilinolein was not related to the incubating concentration. However, long-term (7 days) incubation with trilinolein at same concentration decreased the activity. Similar changes were also observed in the gene expression of SOD in RBA; short-term (2 days) incubation of RBA by 0.1 米M trilinolein increased the mRNA level that was lowered in RBA received a long-term incubation with 0.1 米M trilinolein. This result shows that trilinolein is an effective antioxidant to increase the activity of SOD in RBA which would be beneficial to neurons subjected to oxygen free radical damage. However, long-term medication of antioxidant shall be concerned."

Alwine, ","Cell, Volume 36, Issue 2, February 1984, Pages 381-389, ","We have examined the activation of the SV40 late promoter by inserting the late promoter and the viral origin of replication into chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) transient expression vectors. Very little late promoter activity was detected in CV-1 cells, compared with high activity in COS cells, in which replication occurs due to endogenous T antigen. Nonreplicative counterparts of these plasmids, containing a mutated origin of replication, produced significantly more late promoter activity in COS cells than any of the plasmids in CV-1 cells. When plasmids were cotransfected into CV-1 cells with a plasmid that supplies T antigen, the nonreplicative plasmid displayed 30% of the activity of the replicative plasmid. Using mutant T antigens unable to replicate viral DNA, late promoter activation occurred only with mutant T antigens that retain DNA binding activity. These results demonstrate that T antigen can substantially stimulate late promoter activity directly and independent of viral DNA replication."

Recent advances of these approaches in GEP problems related to the five issues mentioned above are reviewed and discussed in this article."
Suppression of voltage-gated Na+ channels and neuronal excitability by imperatorin,"King-Chuen Wu, Yi-Hung Chen, Ka-Shun Cheng, Yueh-Hsiung Kuo, Yuk-Man Leung, ","European Journal of Pharmacology, Volume 721, Issues 1每3, 5 December 2013, Pages 49-55, ","Imperatorin is a naturally occurring furocoumarin compound isolated from plants such as Angelica archangelica and Cnidium monnieri. It has multiple pharmacological effects including anticonvulsant effects. Here we determined the effects of imperatorin on voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSC) using whole-cell patch clamp techniques in differentiated neuronal NG108-15 cells. We showed that imperatorin inhibited VGSC; such inhibition did not show state-dependence. Imperatorin caused a left shift in the steady-state inactivation curve without affecting activation gating. The inhibition of VGSC by imperatorin displayed a mild frequency-dependence. Imperatorin was also shown to inhibit VGSC and action potential amplitude without affecting voltage-gated K+ channels in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons. In conclusion, our results suggest that imperatorin dampens neuronal excitability by inhibiting VGSC."
Economics of coal log pipeline for transporting coal,"Henry Liu, James S. Noble, Jianping Wu, Robert Zuniga, ","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, Volume 32, Issue 5, September 1998, Pages 377-391, ","This economic study was conducted to compare the cost of transporting coal from mines to power plants by coal log pipeline with other modes of transportation including truck, rail and coal slurry pipeline. Unit cost is defined here as the cost of transporting a metric ton of coal for any prescribed distance in $/T (dollars per metric ton), and it includes not only capital and operational costs, but also a built-in profit for the investor. The unit cost of coal log pipeline can be compared with the current tariffs for coal transportation charged by railroads, trucks and other competing modes to determine whether it is economically competitive in a given situation. The study was conducted for different transportation distances and throughputs. Based on this comparison, the conditions are established under which coal log pipeline is more economical than slurry pipeline, truck and train."

Stabilization of a continuous linear system over channel with network-induced delay and communication constraints,"Jian Wang, Hao Li, ","European Journal of Control, Volume 31, September 2016, Pages 72-78, ","This paper considers the stabilization problem of a continuous linear system over a communication channel with network-induced delay. The channel is of finite data rate and connects the measurement sensor to the controller. Under the channel encoder without access to control inputs, a coding scheme based on spherical polar coordinates is proposed for this problem. Two cases are addressed: (1) in the case that the channel decoder does not utilize control inputs, instead of the original system, the corresponding augmented system is used to estimate the upper and lower bounds of the state norm of the original system for quantization, which simplifies the design of the coding scheme. And a definite relation between the quantized data and the corresponding quantization error is used to present the condition for the stability of the system; (2) in the case that the decoder utilizes control inputs, instead of quantizing the system state at each time step as usual, the encoder quantizes the initial state all the time by updating the parameters of the quantizer, which also simplifies the design of the coding scheme. Sufficient conditions guaranteeing that the system is stable are presented for the two cases, respectively, and the corresponding design methods for coding schemes are given."

Activated neutrophils impair rabbit heart recovery after hypothermic global ischemia,"Mary Lee Myers, Christopher Webb, Margaret Moffat, Donald McIver, Rolando Del Maestro, ","The Annals of Thoracic Surgery, Volume 53, Issue 2, February 1992, Pages 247-252, ","Cardiopulmonary bypass is known to cause neutrophil activation, and activated neutrophils appear to be of importance in myocardial reperfusion injury. This study examined the effect of a preischemic infusion of activated neutrophils on the recovery of myocardial function after 40 minutes of hypothermic global ischemia. Studies were carried out in three groups of Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts: control, control (unactivated) neutrophil infusion, and phorbal myristate acetate-activated neutrophil infusion. The activated neutrophil group showed significant deterioration in function during the activated neutrophil infusion. All three groups demonstrated significant depression of function initially after reperfusion, but the two control groups subsequently recovered to baseline levels. The activated neutrophil group, however, showed a persistent significant depression in ventricular force, rate of ventricular tension development, and rate of ventricular relaxation as well as a significant increase in coronary vascular resistance. It is concluded that activated neutrophils depress myocardial function and contribute to impaired recovery of function after global hypothermic ischemia."

Many of the compounds also maintained high potency in the inhibition of human carcinoma MCF-7 cell growth. However, all were less potent in the inhibition of estradiol-triggered uterine growth. This work demonstrates the sensitive nature of modification to the antagonist basic side chain region.Modifications to the basic side chain region lead to a further understanding of the SAR of the dihydrobenzoxathiin class of SERAMs (Selective Estrogen Receptor Alpha Modulators)."

Integrating 3D-printed PHBV/Calcium sulfate hemihydrate scaffold and chitosan hydrogel for enhanced osteogenic property,"Xiangling Ye, Lihua Li, Zefeng Lin, Weiliang Yang, Ying Zhang, ","Carbohydrate Polymers, Volume 202, 15 December 2018, Pages 106-114, ","We developed the 3D-printed poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)/calcium sulfate hemihydrate (PHBV/CaSH) scaffolds by using fused deposition modelling (FDM) technique and then coated the scaffolds with chitosan (CS) acetic acid solution. After drying and neutralization, CS hydrogel was formed on the surface of the scaffolds. The resultant PHBV/CaSH/CS scaffolds could promote the adhesion and proliferation of rat bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSCs) and enhance the osteogenesis of rBMSCs by up-regulating the expression level of osteogenic genes compared to the PHBV and PHBV/CaSH scaffolds. In vivo studies further demonstrated the PHBV/CaSH/CS scaffolds could effectively promote new bone formation. Therefore, integrating 3D-printed PHBV/CaSH scaffold and CS hrydogel represents a novel strategy to promote osteogensis property, showing full potential for bone defects repair."
Dominant factors to produce single droplet per cycle using drop-on-demand technology driven by pulse electromagnetic force,"Tongju Wang, Jian Lin, Yongping Lei, Xingye Guo, Nan Zhang, ","Vacuum, Volume 156, October 2018, Pages 128-134, ","A nontoxic liquid metal droplets, such as gallium based eutectic alloys, has been used to develop the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Therefore, a droplet generator on demand has been proposed to study the formation process of droplet by using pulse electromagnetic force technology. It allows the production of uniform droplet in a controlled way, which entails important technological advantages over existing techniques. The results indicates that, compared with triangular wave and sine wave, the pulse wave can produce single droplet per cycle at a constant amplitude current and higher droplet formation frequency; the process parameters, such as the amplitude, frequency of input current, and electronic pulse width have a significant effect on the droplet formation. This work provides a useful parameter-selection approach for droplets production."

A temporal bone CT scan showed complete left middle ear and mastoid air cell opacification. The patient underwent left tympanomastoidectomy for removal of the middle ear mass with pathologic confirmation of a dermoid tumor. The patient continues to do well post-operatively without evidence of disease recurrence. To our knowledge, only thirteen cases of middle ear dermoid tumors have been reported. The clinical and radiographic presentation of dermoid tumors can be similar to congenital cholesteatoma, but they are histopathologically distinct lesions. Surgical removal of the dermoid tumor is an effective treatment strategy as recurrence rates are low."
Babesia microti-like piroplasm (syn. Babesia vulpes) infection in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in NW Spain (Galicia) and its relationship with Ixodes hexagonus,"Roc赤o Checa, Ana Mar赤a L車pez-Beceiro, Ana Montoya, Juan Pedro Barrera, Guadalupe Mir車, ","Veterinary Parasitology, Volume 252, 15 March 2018, Pages 22-28, ","Piroplasmosis is caused by several species of protozoa such as the Babesia microti-like piroplasm (Bml), an emerging blood protozoan also known as Theileria annae or Babesia vulpes. Infection by Bml was first reported in dogs in Spain where it is endemic today. Recently, a high prevalence of Bml has been increasingly detected in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in European countries. The objective of this study was to determine infection levels of this parasite in foxes from Galicia, NW Spain, and ticks species infestation in these carnivores, where they are so far unknown. Samples of blood, spleen and ticks (if present) were taken from 237 hunted red foxes in the Galicia region. Blood smears were prepared for direct parasite observation, and spleen and tick samples were examined by nested PCR. Prevalences of Bml infection in Galician red foxes were estimated at 72% (171/237) by PCR and 38.23% (26/68) by direct observation. Among 837 ticks collected, the main tick identified was Ixodes hexagonus (present in 82.4% of the foxes) followed by Ixodes ricinus (12.3%), Dermacentor reticulatus (12.3%) and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (3.5%). From 34 foxes testing positive for Bml, 616 ticks were collected: positive Bml PCR results were obtained in 55.6% (227/408) of ticks collected from 9 foxes, while the 208 ticks from the remaining 25 infected foxes returned negative PCR results. Given that canine piroplasmosis is endemic in this area, our observations point to the red fox as the main reservoir for Bml infection and the high proportion of I. hexagonus among ticks collected from red foxes suggests its likely role as vectors of B. microti-like piroplasm in this region. Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the link between the wild and domestic life cycles of this piroplasm."

BAP1 immunohistochemistry has limited prognostic utility as a complement of CDKN2A (p16) fluorescence in situ hybridization in malignant pleural mesothelioma,"Stephanie M. McGregor, James McElherne, Agata Minor, Jennifer Keller-Ramey, Thomas Krausz, ","Human Pathology, Volume 60, February 2017, Pages 86-94, ","BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) and CDKN2A (p16) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have shown clinical utility in confirming the diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), but the role for using these 2 markers to guide clinical management is not yet clear. Although p16 loss is predictive of poor prognosis, there is controversy as to whether BAP1 loss is predictive of a more favorable prognosis; how these results interact with one another has not been explored. We performed CDKN2A FISH on a previously published tissue microarray on which we had performed BAP1 IHC, revealing combined BAP1/p16 status for 93 MPM cases. As expected, BAP1 IHC in combination with CDKN2A FISH resulted in high sensitivity (84%) and specificity (100%) for MPM, and p16 loss was an independent predictor of poor survival (hazard ratio, 2.2553; P = .0135). There was no association between BAP1 loss and p16 loss, as 26%, 28%, 30%, and 16% of overall cases demonstrated loss of BAP1 alone, loss of p16 alone, loss of both BAP1 and p16, or neither abnormality, respectively. Although multivariate analysis demonstrated that BAP1 IHC is not an independent predictor of prognosis, when viewed in combination with homozygous CDKN2A deletion, risk stratification was evident. More specifically, patients with CDKN2A disomy and loss of BAP1 expression had improved outcomes compared with those with CDKN2A disomy and retained BAP1 expression (hazard ratio, 0.2286; P = .0017), and this finding was notably evident among epithelioid cases. We conclude that BAP1 IHC provides prognostic information within the context of CDKN2A FISH that may have clinical utility beyond diagnosis."

The results show that, for the proposed R744 system in different regions, the earth's energy imbalance degree can always be decreased to zero by optimizing the cooling load proportion of air-cooled gas cooler. Comparing with the system without air-cooled gas cooler, the investment cost of the proposed R744 system is decreased by 14.5每25.5% due to the decreasing cost of ground heat exchanger, and the coefficient of performance is increased. With the increase of ground heat exchanger depth, the performance deteriorates, and the ground heat exchanger with shorter depth is preferred in the GSHPS. The investment and operation costs of the proposed R744 system are lower than that of the existing R134a system."
Model for oxygen transfer in rotating biological contactor,"Vijay Kubsad, Sanjeev Chaudhari, S. K.

In this study the transfer of oxygen from air to water by a rotating disc air每liquid contactor in physical system is investigated. The oxygen transfer model suggested by Kim and Molof, Water Sci. Technol. 14 (1982) 569, was modified and the developed model is termed as modified Kim and Molof model. The model was calibrated by using available data in literature and validated by experiments conducted in this study. The effect of significant physical parameters was integrated into a single term and is termed as volume renewal number. The modified Kim and Molof model was compared with the other available models. The coefficient of determination (R2) for the modified Kim and Molof model obtained is 0.95 which is much higher than in the other available models. Thereby the model is expected to estimate oxygen transfer more accurately. Further, a simplified linear model between KLa and the volume renewal number is proposed. Both modified Kim and Molof and linear model estimate the overall oxygen transfer coefficient (KLa) accurately."

A shear device was designed for testing the friction interface, and the compressive force on the interface was realized by a pretension high strength bolt. Cyclic loading tests were conducted for evaluating the friction performance of the interfaces, and loading frequency, loading amplitude, and magnitude of compressive force on the interface were considered as main influencing parameters. Experimental results showed that with the same magnitude of compressive force on the interface, the sliding shear force of the PTFE-steel interface was much smaller than that of the NAO-steel interface. An average friction coefficient of 0.12 was obtained for the NAO-steel interface, while an average friction coefficient of 0.025 was obtained for the PTFE-steel interface. Both friction interfaces exhibited stable and predictable behavior. The interfaces were further utilized in a slip friction damping device developed for upgrading the seismic performance of a novel timber-steel hybrid seismic resistant structure, and analytical results revealed that both structural damage and unrecoverable deformation of the structure were significantly decreased with the application of the damping devices."
Inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis increases erythrocyte membrane fluidity and unsaturated fatty acid content,"Anne McLaren Dorrance, Delyth Graham, Anna Dominiczak, Robert Fraser, ","American Journal of Hypertension, Volume 13, Issue 11, November 2000, Pages 1194-1202, ","Changes in the lipid composition of the membrane affect its fluidity and function. These variables are altered in various forms of hypertension. Our hypothesis was that the rapid increase in blood pressure (BP) caused by inhibition of nitric oxide production would lead to alterations in membrane fluidity similar to those observed in genetic hypertension. We used N肋-nitro l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and vehicle-treated (3 weeks) Wistar-Kyoto rats to study the effects of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition on membrane fluidity and lipid composition. Erythrocyte membrane fluidity was measured by fluorescence anisotropy. Membrane lipids were separated using Sep-Pak and thin-layer chromatography. Fatty acid methyl esters were produced and analyzed by gas chromatography每mass spectrometry. N肋-nitro l-arginine methyl ester treatment increased BP and erythrocyte membrane fluidity. The phospholipid and unsaturated fatty acid levels in the membranes from the L-NAME每treated rats were consistent with the increase in fluidity (ie, more unsaturated fatty acid, in particular, arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid) and a reduction in membrane sphingomyelin content. Fatty acid analysis of individual lipid groups suggested the changes in membrane fatty acid composition may be asymmetric, with the majority of the changes occurring in the outer leaflet. Inhibition of NOS results in changes in membrane composition that may explain the concurrent changes in fluidity. The increased membrane fluidity observed here contrasts with the reduced fluidity observed in genetic hypertension or unchanged fluidity in secondary hypertension. The effects could be related to NOS inhibition or may be a direct effect of L-NAME."

A common polymorphism for BDNF has been associated with abnormal cortical plasticity, and thus might contribute to pathogenesis of dystonia in some subjects. As a first step towards this suggestion, the current study examined the prevalence of this polymorphism. BDNF genotype was examined in 34 subjects with cervical dystonia, 54 age-matched healthy controls, and 53 subjects with a different movement disorder, Parkinson's disease. ApoE genotype, known to influence neurological outcome in some conditions, was also examined as a control. In subjects with cervical dystonia, the val66met polymorphism was approximately twice as prevalent when compared to either control group. This was not true of ApoE genotype, which was similarly distributed across subject groups. The current findings suggest that the BDNF val66met polymorphism might play a role in the pathogenesis of cervical dystonia in some subjects."

A prospective observational study of 272 patients admitted to the coronary care unit was conducted at a tertiary referral teaching hospital and a community teaching hospital. In stepwise multivariate analysis, having less than a college education, poor cardiac function, not having undergone a previous cardiac catheterization, being a patient in a nonreferral community hospital, and current smoking were positively associated with a patient's stating that he or she would disagree with a physician's recommendation for a cardiac catheterization. The stepwise multivariate model with cardiac catheterization as the dependent variable indicated that being a patient in a referral medical center, patient willingness to accept a physician's recommendation for a cardiac catheterization, severe heart disease, and having attended high school were predictive. Women did not differ from men in their preference for or receipt of cardiac catheterization. Patients in the coronary care unit with lower levels of education were less likely to undergo cardiac catheterization. This association was only partly explained by less educated patients' being less willing to accept a physician's recommendation to undergo cardiac catheterization."

From numerous measurements of MTB concentration on each day of the estrous cycle, it is clear that this compound could well serve as a natural chemical signal of the estrous state of the female. Both the ability of MTB to attract male hamsters and its ability to facilitate copulatory behavior toward female surrogates were evaluated in behavioral experiments. The responses to MTB were compared to those elicited by dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), by a mixture of MTB and DMDS, by a grand mixture of MTB and DMDS with thirteen other known volatile constituents of the vaginal discharge, and by fresh vaginal discharge. In contrast to fresh vaginal discharge, none of the identified compounds or mixtures facilitated male copulatory behavior. Most of the attraction observed in the behavioral experiments could be attributed to the DMDS in the test samples. The MTB is readily converted to DMDS and may serve as a precursor of DMDS in the vaginal discharge."

Effects of recess depth and opening diameter on pressure measurement by recess mounted transducers in a hypersonic boundary layer,"Shiyong Yao, Changwan Min, Shaofei Xie, Haiyan Li, Yi Duan, ","Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science, Volume 97, October 2018, Pages 296-303, ","Experimental measurements of pressure fluctuations in a hypersonic boundary layer were conducted based on recess mounted transducers and the effects of recess depth and opening diameter on fluctuating pressure characteristics were studied. The results showed that as the recess depth increased, the bulk of counter flow in the cavity enlarged with the decreased energy of large scale structures, and more small scale structures with relatively high frequency were generated which contributed to the multiscale structures with broadband frequency spectrum. Similarly, as the opening diameter increased, the low-frequency large scale structures inside the cavity had larger energy due to the shear flow entering the cavity having more mass and carrying larger energy, and the small scale structures with high frequency exhibited stronger dissipation intensity. The symmetric and stable flow filed was more likely to cause the cavity resonance, and the asymmetry and instability of the flow field for smaller recess depth as well as larger opening diameter could inhibit the cavity resonance. Compared to surface mounted, nonlinear phase coupling occurred between the flow structures caused by recess mounting which transfered the energy from high-frequency structures to low-frequency structures. On the whole, smaller recess depth and larger opening diameter are optimized in the hypersonic flight test on the premise of pressure sensors not destroyed by the harsh aerothermodynamic environment."

Sometimes overlooked in the literature is the fact that governments, especially in transition economies, often use state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to pursue non-financial objectives and to finance the resulting social burdens with subsidies and policy loans. In studying a panel of about 700 SOEs, we find that hardening budget constraints, without at the same time relieving SOEs from their social burdens, was a major proximate cause of rising redundant labor in the early 1990s in China."

Hence the concentrations of anthocyanins, epicatechin, quercetin glycosides, chlorogenic acid, chlorophylls, and carotenoids in peel disks taken from areas exhibiting ＆Fuji＊ stain were compared to concentrations observed in peel disks not exhibiting ＆Fuji＊ stain. In 2005, peel from sunburned apples exhibiting ＆Fuji＊ stain was compared to peel from three areas of sunburned apples not exhibiting stain [i.e. sunburned peel, the area around the sunburned peel (halo), and the area around the halo (OH)]. Additionally, stained peel was compared to the sun-exposed side of non-stained non-sunburned apples (NSNB). The second year, 2006, we compared stained peel to NSNB peel and the area outside the stained area (OS) on those fruit with stain. The concentrations of idaein, epicatechin, and quercetin glycosides were consistently low in the stained peel both years. This is in contrast to our earlier studies in which sunburned ＆Fuji＊ apples had high concentrations of quercetin glycosides and epicatechin and low concentrations of idaein, and non-sunburned apples had low concentrations of quercetin glycosides and epicatechin and high concentrations of idaein. The consistent and unique characteristic of stained peel reported here indicates an association of these compounds with the incidence of stain. In 2005, chlorogenic acid concentrations in the stain peel were lower than other peel types, but in 2006 they were higher. Differences in chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations were observed among many of the peel types. However, there is not a clear association between stain development and changes in chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations due to significant differences not being observed in both years. While our research provides insight into pigment changes associated with ＆Fuji＊ stain formation, more work is needed to help clarify the inconsistencies observed between the 2 years."

Effective anchoring of silver nanoparticles onto N-doped carbon with enhanced catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate to methyl glycolate,"Menglin Hu, Yin Yan, Xinping Duan, Linmin Ye, Youzhu Yuan, ","Catalysis Communications, Volume 100, September 2017, Pages 148-152, ","Silver nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped activated carbon (Ag/AC-N) are demonstrated as promising catalysts for the chemoselective hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate to methyl glycolate. Characteristic studies by TPR, XPS, and Raman indicate that AC-N benefits the dispersion of silver nanoparticles due to the strong electronic interactions between nitrogen and silver species. The optimized Ag/AC-N catalyst shows intensified performance in terms of high activity and excellent stability. It is inferred that the co-existence of Ag0 and Ag+ derived from the strong interactions of nitrogen with Ag species renders the superior catalytic performance of Ag/AC-N.Download high-res image (112KB)Download full-size image"
EGFR and Ras regulate DDX59 during lung cancer development,"Lin Yang, Hanyin Zhang, Dan Chen, Peikun Ding, Yandong Zhang, ","Gene, Volume 642, 5 February 2018, Pages 95-102, ","Oncogenes EGFR and ras are frequently mutated and activated in human lung cancers. In this report, we found that both EGFR and Ras signaling can upregulate RNA helicase DDX59 in lung cancer cells. DDX59 can be induced through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway after EGFR or Ras activation. Inhibitors for Ras/Raf/MAP pathway significantly decreased DDX59 expression at both protein and mRNA levels. Through immunohistochemistry, we found that DDX59 protein expression correlated with Ras and EGFR mutation status in human lung adenocarcinoma. Finally, through a xenograft nude mice model, we demonstrated that DDX59 is pivotal for EGFR mutated lung cancer cell growth in vivo. Our study identified a novel protein downstream of Ras and EGFR, which may serve as a potential therapeutic drug target for lung cancer patients."
De Novo Variants in the F-Box Protein FBXO11 in 20 Individuals with a Variable Neurodevelopmental Disorder,"Anne Gregor, Lynette G. Sadleir, Reza Asadollahi, Silvia Azzarello-Burri, Christiane Zweier, ","The American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 103, Issue 2, 2 August 2018, Pages 305-316, ","Next-generation sequencing combined with international data sharing has enormously facilitated identification of new disease-associated genes and mutations. This is particularly true for genetically extremely heterogeneous entities such as neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Through exome sequencing and world-wide collaborations, we identified and assembled 20 individuals with de novo variants in FBXO11. They present with mild to severe developmental delay associated with a range of features including short (4/20) or tall (2/20) stature, obesity (5/20), microcephaly (4/19) or macrocephaly (2/19), behavioral problems (17/20), seizures (5/20), cleft lip or palate or bifid uvula (3/20), and minor skeletal anomalies. FBXO11 encodes a member of the F-Box protein family, constituting a subunit of an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is involved in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and thus in controlling critical biological processes by regulating protein turnover. The identified de novo aberrations comprise two large deletions, ten likely gene disrupting variants, and eight missense variants distributed throughout FBXO11. Structural modeling for missense variants located in the CASH or the Zinc-finger UBR domains suggests destabilization of the protein. This, in combination with the observed spectrum and localization of identified variants and the lack of apparent genotype-phenotype correlations, is compatible with loss of function or haploinsufficiency as an underlying mechanism. We implicate de novo missense and likely gene disrupting variants in FBXO11 in a neurodevelopmental disorder with variable intellectual disability and various other features."
Effect of dioscin on promoting liver regeneration via activating Notch1/Jagged1 signal pathway,"Lina Xu, Lina Gu, Xufeng Tao, Youwei Xu, Jinyong Peng, ","Phytomedicine, Volume 38, 1 January 2018, Pages 107-117, ","Development of novel candidates to promote liver regeneration is critical important after partial hepatectomy (PH). Dioscin, a natural product, shows potent effect on liver protection in our previous works.This work aimed to investigate the effect and underlying mechanisms of dioscin on liver regeneration.The promoting proliferation effects of dioscin on mouse hepatocytem AML12 cells, rat primary hepatocytes, rats and mice after 70% PH were evaluated.Dioscin significantly promoted proliferation of rat primary hepatocytes and AML12 cells through MTT, BrdU and PCNA staining assays. Meanwhile, dioscin rapidly recovered the liver to body weight ratios, declined ALT and AST levels, and relieved hepatocytes necrosis compared with 70% PH operation groups in rats and mice. Mechanistic test showed that dioscin significantly increased Notch1 and Jagged1 levels, and accelerated 污-secretase activity by up-regulating PS1 expression, leading to nuclear translocation of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1). Subsequently, the significant activation of Notch-dependent target genes (Hey1, Hes1, EGFR, VEGF), and cell-cycle regulatory proteins (CyclinD1, CyclinE1, CDK4 and CDK2) were all recognized. In addition, these results were further confirmed by Notch1 siRNA silencing and inhibition of 污-secretase by DAPT (a well-characterized 污-secretase inhibitor) in vitro.Dioscin, as a novel efficient 污-secretase activator, NICD1 nucleus translocation promoter and cell cycle regulator, markedly activated Notch1/Jagged1 pathway to promote hepato-proliferation.

Postmortem Ageing Influences the Thawed Meat Quality of Frozen Lamb Loins,"Guixia Li, Zheng Li, Xin Li, Ying Wang, Dequan Zhang, ","Food Chemistry, In press, accepted manuscript, Available online 15 September 2018, ","The aim of this study was to determine the effect of postmortem ageing on quality attributes of frozen/thawed lamb loins. The loins (M. Longissimus dorsi; n = 30) were randomly divided into six groups: five frozen treatment groups and the control (4 ∼C for 120 h). Treatment groups were frozen for 3 weeks and thawed at 4∼C overnight, muscles were preserved at 4∼C until 120 h. Compared to the control, pH values and color of frozen meat declined (P<0.05) after ageing for 72 h, lower shear force values and higher water loss with earlier freezing were due to extensive degradation of myofibril protein. These results indicated the loins frozen in earlier period could accelerate ageing rate, but impaired meat quality inevitably, freezing between 12 h and 24 h postmortem was a better consideration."

An oppositional wolf pack algorithm for Parameter identification of the chaotic systems,"Hao Li, Husheng Wu, ","Optik, Volume 127, Issue 20, October 2016, Pages 9853-9864, ","Parameter identification is an important issue for chaotic systems, which have been investigated intensely in several fields such as secure communication, power converters and biological systems. To solve the above problem, most existing evolutionary algorithms were proposed. However, the existing evolutionary algorithms have their own limitations when solving the parameter identification problem. Therefore, we propose a novel and efficient oppositional wolf pack algorithm (OWPA), which has good balance of exploitation and exploration, to estimate the parameters of Lorenz chaotic system. First, an oppositional initial population producing method is proposed to enhance the global convergence. Second, the opposition-based learning method is presented for new wolf producing in wolf pack algorithm, which cannot only enhance the local searching ability of wolf pack algorithm in normal situation but also increase the diversity of distributed population in catastrophic situation. Furthermore, the proposed oppositional wolf pack algorithm is applied to estimate the parameters for Lorenz chaotic system under the offline and online condition. Finally, numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the above proposed algorithm has more effectiveness and robustness than the existing popular algorithms (i.e., particle swarm optimization algorithm, firefly algorithm and cuckoo search algorithm)."

When developing arrays for parallel transmit systems, one of the primary factors to be considered is the mechanism to manage coupling and create independently operating channels. Recent work has demonstrated the use of amplifiers to provide some or all of the channel-to-channel isolation, reducing the need for on-coil decoupling networks in a manner analogous to the use of isolation preamplifiers with receive coils. This paper discusses an eight-channel transmit/receive head array for use with an ultra-low output impedance (ULOI) parallel transmit system. The ULOI amplifiers eliminated the need for a complex lumped element network to decouple the eight-rung array. The design and construction details of the array are discussed in addition to the measurement considerations required for appropriately characterizing an array when using ULOI amplifiers.

In this work, by employing multiple microelectromechanical resonators both as actuators and sensors, on-chip heating, mixing and chemical reaction monitoring are successfully demonstrated. Mechanism studies using COMSOL simulations indicate that the local heating and mixing are induced by the acoustic wave attenuation during its transmission in liquid. On-line chemical reaction monitoring is realized by viscosity sensing using the same resonator through impedance analysis. Classic Diels-Alder reaction in a single droplet was performed to verify the feasibility of using such microsystem for mixing, heating and online reaction monitoring at microscale."

Most of the studies in the literature on verifying the safety properties of concurrent programs are for high-level languages, specifications, or calculi. Therefore, more studies are needed on concurrency verification for machine level language programs. This paper describes a framework of a Petri net based safety policy for the verification of concurrent assembly programs, to exploit the capability of Petri nets in concurrency modeling. The concurrency safety properties can be considered separately using the net structure and by mixing Hoare logic and computational tree logic. Therefore, more useful higher-level safety properties can be specified and verified."

Studies suggest an increased incidence in developed nations in recent decades as well as differential geographic incidence and prevalence rates, and differences between the genders. We updated urolithiasis epidemiological data by examining the incidence and prevalence rates in a stable rural Wisconsin population.Data were obtained from the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area database, a surveillance tool created in 1991 to track disease in residents of an area of 24 ZIP Codes including approximately 85,000 individuals, of whom most receive care at Marshfield Clinic and affiliates. Urolithiasis cases were identified using ICD-9 codes. Incidence, prevalence and recurrence rates were determined.The mean age adjusted incidence of new onset urolithiasis per 100,000 person-years was 202 (95% CL 168每235) in 1992 and 289 (95% CL 253每325) in 2008.

Unsteady aerodynamic model of flexible flapping wing,"Si Chen, Hao Li, Shijun Guo, Mingbo Tong, Bing Ji, ","Aerospace Science and Technology, Volume 80, September 2018, Pages 354-367, ","Bio-inspired flapping wing has potential application to micro air vehicles (MAV). Due to the nature of lightweight and flexibility of micro flapping wing structures, elastic deformation as a result of aeroelastic coupling is inevitable in flapping motion. This effect can be significant and beneficial to the aerodynamic performance as revealed in the present investigation for a flexible flapping wing of variable camber versus a rigid one. Firstly a two dimensional (2D) unsteady aerodynamic model (UAM) based on potential flow theory has been extended from previous study. Both leading and trailing edge discrete vortices are included in the model with unsteady Kutta condition satisfied to fully characterize the unsteady flow around a flapping wing. A wall function is created to modify the induced velocity of the vortices in the UAM to solve the vortices penetration problem. The modified UAM is then validated by comparing with CFD results of a typical insect-like flapping motion from previous research. Secondly the UAM is further extended for a flexible flapping wing of camber variation. Comparing with a rigid wing in a prescribed plunging and pitching motion, the results show lift increase with positive camber in upstroke by mitigating negative lift. The results also agree well with CFD simulation. Thirdly the 2D UAM is extended to calculate the aerodynamic forces of a 3D wing with camber variation, and validated by CFD results. Finally the model is applied to aerodynamic analysis of a 3D flexible flapping wing with aeroelastic coupling effect. Significant increase of lift coefficient can be achieved for a flexible flapping wing of positive camber and twist in upstroke produced by the structure elastic deformation."

"Reduced growth, body condition and foot length of the bivalve Austrovenus stutchburyi in response to parasite infection","Sorrel A. O'Connell-Milne, Robert Poulin, Candida Savage, William Rayment, ","Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, Volume 474, January 2016, Pages 23-28, ","Parasites often have direct impacts on their host physiology or function, which can in turn have indirect effects on interspecific interactions and ecosystem structure. The present study investigates the effect of trematode parasite infection on the ecologically and commercially important venerid clam Austrovenus stutchburyi. Although the indirect impacts of clam infection on the broader benthic community, mediated by impaired burrowing of parasitized clams, have been well documented before, the more direct impacts on the clam itself remain poorly studied. The consequence of parasite infection on clam growth rate, mortality, body condition and foot length was quantified in a three-month laboratory experiment, in which juvenile clams were infected with varying levels of the echinostome trematode Curtuteria australis. Although mortality was unaffected by parasite infection, greater numbers of parasites deleteriously affected the growth rate, body condition and foot length of clams. This may result in delayed maturity and a lower filtration rate for infected individuals, as well as a reduced ability to bury into the sediment. Consequently, increased parasite infection not only has subsequent broader impacts on the surrounding ecological community, but can also affect the clam host directly and lower its value as a harvested species.Download high-res image (177KB)Download full-size image"

A pyrazoloquinolone and indolocarbazole inhibited [3H]phosphopeptide binding in both assays. Their potency in the SPA increased with prolonged (2 to 24 h) assay exposure to ambient light. They were inactive in absence of light and in an alternate binding assay. Both compounds absorbed visible light and generated singlet oxygen based on 2-methylfuran-trapping experiments. Their inhibitory activity was suppressed by the singlet oxygen scavengers sodium azide and dithiothreitol. The results suggest that compounds, not previously considered photosensitizers, generated enough singlet oxygen to damage oxidant-sensitive SPA components. Therefore, this SPA should be protected from light to minimize occurrence of false positives."

This might arise because the conformations of the five-membered chelate rings for the ligands are slightly different, with that for 2 showing a greater degree of puckering."
Experimental study of heat transfer and scale formation of spiral grooved tube in the falling film distilled desalination,"Chun-hua Qi, Xu Han, Hong-qing Lv, Yu-lei Xing, Ke-xin Han, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 119, April 2018, Pages 654-664, ","The heat transfer performance and scale formation of spiral-grooved tube in the falling film evaporator was studied experimentally compared with the conventional smooth tube. A series of experiments were performed contrastively on the two types of heat transfer tube based on a heat exchange test platform of horizontal tube falling film evaporation for desalination. The influences of various factors on heat transfer coefficients for the spiral-grooved and smooth tubes were investigated. Heat transfer experiments indicated that the heat transfer coefficient of the spiral-grooved tube can be improved by approximately 35%, comparing with the smooth tube under the same experimental conditions. The anti-scaling capability of spiral grooved tube is a little better than that of smooth tube. Their scaling layers had similar thickness under the same operation condition, and their cohesiveness with the tube was weak. Experimental findings indicated that the spiral-grooved tube was feasible for application in seawater desalination given the enhancement of heat transfer and anti-scaling characteristics."

Turnbull, ","Crop Protection, Volume 105, March 2018, Pages 49-58, ","Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) has excellent potential as an alternative crop to canola in southern Alberta farming systems. However, soybean is susceptible to Fusarium root rot, which usually results in the occurrence of dead or dying plants in mid-to-late summer and severe reductions in yield. A total of 102 isolates identified as Fusarium were recovered from diseased soybean root samples collected from central and southern Alberta from 2011 to 2013. Ten species of Fusarium were identified, with F. acuminatum as the predominant species (31 out of 102 isolates, 30.39%), followed by F. equiseti (16.67%), F. culmorum (13.73%), F. avenaceum (10.78%), F. oxysporum (8.82%), F. redolens (7.84%), F. torulosum (4.90%), F. tricinctum (2.94%), F. commune (1.96%) and F. proliferatum (0.98%). This is the first report of F. commune, F. redolens and F. torulosum causing root rot in soybean in Canada. Phylogenetic analyses based on sequence data from the translation elongation factor 1-汐 (EF-1汐) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region were used to evaluate genetic variation and, in conjunction with morphological characters, for species identification. All of the Fusarium isolates were able to infect soybean, although some exhibited varying levels of aggressiveness."

Diagnoses were assessed at follow-up interviews using the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation. The mean duration of follow-up was 5 years and the mean interval between assessments was 8.2 months.Diagnostic conversion to BP-I or BP-II occurred in 63 subjects (45%): 32 (23%) to BP-I (nine of whom had initially converted to BP-II) and 31 to only BP-II (22%). Median time from intake to conversion was 58 weeks. First- or second-degree family history of mania or hypomania was the strongest baseline predictor of diagnostic conversion (p = .006). Over follow-up, conversion was associated with greater intensity of hypomanic symptoms and with greater exposure to specialized, intensive outpatient psychosocial treatments. There was no association between conversion and exposure to treatment with particular medication classes.Children and adolescents referred with mood symptoms that meet operationalized criteria for BP-NOS, particularly those with a family history of BP, frequently progress to BP-I or BP-II. Efforts to identify these youth and effectively intervene may have the potential to curtail the progression of mood disorders in this high-risk population."

Dynamic characteristics and buckling strength of composite-repaired aluminum plates,"P. Frank Pai, Amir H. Naghshineh-Pour, Mark J. Schulz, Jaycee Chung, ","Finite Elements in Analysis and Design, Volume 28, Issue 3, 3 January 1998, Pages 255-275, ","A dynamic finite-element model of a cracked aluminum plate repaired with a composite laminate is presented and the influence of cracks and debond of the repair laminate on the static strength and dynamic characteristics of the repaired structure are investigated. NASTRAN is used to develop a refined two-dimensional finite-element model that accounts for cracks in the aluminum plate, the debond of the repair laminate from the aluminum plate, and transverse shear deformations. The transverse shear effects are accounted for by using an energy-equivalent first-order shear-deformation theory derived from a new layerwise higher-order model of transverse shear deformations. Normal mode analysis shows that debond of the patch significantly reduces natural frequencies and changes the mode shapes of only the higher modes. Frequency response analysis shows that the debond of the patch causes a large change in the magnitudes and shapes of frequency response functions (FRFs) near the patch in the direction of the excitation. Moreover, linear buckling analysis shows that debond reduces the buckling load and may change the buckling mode shape. However, the critical size of debond that reduces the buckling load to a certain percentage of the healthy case is boundary-condition-dependent. Transverse shear deformations also reduce the natural frequencies, move the FRFs to the low-frequency range, and reduce the buckling loads, but they have no significant influence on mode shapes and the shape of the FRFs. This damage characterization study provides information useful for the design of composite repair patches and the development of health-monitoring systems using FRFs."

Understanding the N2O production pathways and their contribution to total emissions is the key to effective mitigation. Isotope technology is a promising method that has been applied to WWTS for quantifying the N2O production pathways. Within the scope of WWTS, this article reviews the current status of different isotope approaches, including both natural abundance and labelled isotope approaches, to N2O production pathways quantification. It identifies the limitations and potential problems with these approaches, as well as improvement opportunities. We conclude that, while the capabilities of isotope technology have been largely recognized, the quantification of N2O production pathways with isotope technology in WWTS require further improvement, particularly in relation to its accuracy and reliability."

Physical examination demonstrated a mass in the left middle ear. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 4 cm, T1-/T2-isointense, contrast-enhancing mass in the middle cranial fossa. The erosive mass extended into the middle ear and surrounding temporal lobe. A trans-zygomatic approach with a pterional craniotomy exposed a well-encapsulated, highly vascular mass. Manipulation of the tumor resulted in significant hemorrhage. Following removal from the temporal lobe and middle ear, an anterior petrosectomy was performed to remove tumor from the internal auditory canal (IAC) and carotid artery. The facial nerve near the IAC was encased in tumor, and all but a small amount of tumor adherent to the nerve was successfully removed. The final pathologic diagnosis was anaplastic hemangiopericytoma (WHO Grade III). Metastatic workup revealed no extracranial disease, and the patient underwent adjuvant radiation therapy. He continues to do well with only mild disequilibrium at one year follow-up.Hemangiopericytomas are rare, malignant neoplasms that are aggressive and highly vascular. Current management recommendations include excision followed by radiotherapy. Close surveillance is required for patients with anaplastic hemangiopericytoma due to the aggressive nature of this tumor and its propensity for recurrence or metastasis."

Secret sharing with multi-cover adaptive steganography,"Hai-Dong Yuan, ","Information Sciences, Volume 254, 1 January 2014, Pages 197-212, ","More and more studies have been dedicated to investigating secret sharing with steganography. Unfortunately, no previous work has ever reported its capability to resist steganalysis. In this paper, we pose the multi-cover adaptive steganography problem. Two secret sharing methods for natural images based on multi-cover adaptive steganography have been proposed. The secret information is adaptively shared into textured regions of covers by a spatial ㊣1 operation. In comparison to previous secret sharing methods, each of the proposed methods uses a simple share-constructing operation and each has lossless secret reconstruction and high quality shares. More importantly, the proposed methods are more secure in terms of resistance against state-of-the-art steganalysis techniques. In comparison to previous steganographic methods, the proposed methods hide secret bits among textured regions with different covers and are thus difficult to detect. Moreover, the proposed methods can be used to adaptively embed location-sensitive secrets (e.g., secret images) and require no stego key for extracting the encrypted message. These results also have significance in individual cover steganography. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

The problem is a general form of the maximum clique problem. In this paper, we encode weight of vertex into a unique fixed length oligonucleotide segment and employ sticker model to solve the problem. The proposed method has two distinct characteristics. On one hand, we skip generating initial data pool that contains every possible solution to the problem of interest, the key point of which is constructing the solution instead of searching solution in the vast initial data pool according to logic constraints. On the other hand, oligonucleotide segments are treated like variables which store weights on vertices, no matter what kind of number the weights are, integer or real. Therefore, the proposed method can solve the problem with arbitrary weight values and be applied to solve the other weight-related problem. In addition, molecular beacon is also employed in order to overcome shortcomings of sticker model. Besides, we have analyzed the proposed algorithm＊s feasibility."

Today it is possible, at times, to obtain several genetically identical offspring from one original embryo. However, the production of a large number of genetically identical animals must be realized before cloning will have a major impact on animal industries. In order to realize this potential there must be continued improvements in all facets of the cloning procedure. In the past few years there has been steady progress in improving the nuclear transplantation techniques. These techniques include oocyte enucleation, blastomere transfer, cell fusion, oocyte activation, preimplantation development and embryo transfer. Owing to the multitude of steps involved in cloning, further advancements in all of these areas will be needed to obtain an efficient system of cloning embryos.

Patients with dyspnea, tachypnea, evidence of hypoxemia, and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph should be hospitalized. Patients with severe illness or underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of more severe disease should be treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir as soon as possible, without waiting for the results of laboratory tests. Lung-protective ventilation strategy with a low tidal volume and adequate pressure, in addition to a conservative fluid management approach, is recommended when treating adult patients with ARDS. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has emerged as an important rescue therapy for critically ill patients. Use of systemic steroids was associated with delayed viral clearance in severe acute respiratory syndrome and H3N2 infection. Low-dose corticosteroids may be considered in the treatment of refractory septic shock. Passive immunotherapy in the form of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin may be explored as rescue therapy. More data are needed to explore the potential role of IV gamma globulin and other drugs with immunomodulating properties, such as statins, gemfibrozil, and N-acetyl-cysteine. Health-care workers must apply strict standard and droplet precautions when dealing with suspected and confirmed case and upgrade to airborne precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures.

Developing evidence-based treatments should be based on testable models of the psychological mechanisms maintaining psychopathology. The Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model proposes that maladaptive metacognitive beliefs and processes are central to the development and maintenance of emotional distress. Although preliminary support exists for the role of metacognitive beliefs in emotional distress in PWE, their role has yet to be tested when controlling for the contribution made by illness perceptions.Four hundred and fifty-seven PWE completed an online survey, which assessed anxiety, depression, metacognitive beliefs, illness perceptions, general demographic factors, and epilepsy characteristics.Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that metacognitive beliefs and illness perceptions were both associated with anxiety and depression when controlling for the influence of demographic variables and epilepsy characteristics. However, metacognitive beliefs accounted for more variance in anxiety and depression than illness perceptions.Metacognitive beliefs appear to make a greater contribution to anxiety and depression in PWE than illness perceptions. Prospective studies are now needed to establish the causal role of metacognitive beliefs in both the development and persistence of emotional distress."

It decomposes an ODS into central and boundary solutions using a sliding-window least-squares curve-fitting technique, and the boundary solutions can be used to reveal damage locations, and the central solutions can be used to identify boundary conditions. Except an experimental ODS the method requires no model or historical data for comparison. Exact mode shapes and ODSs of beams with damage are obtained by spectral element analysis. Boundary and central solutions caused by different boundary conditions, different loading conditions, and different damage with or without noise are simulated and characterized. Numerical results show that Gibbs' phenomenon caused by the use of continuously differential functions to fit ODSs with discontinuous first-, second-, and/or third-order derivatives actually makes boundary solutions excellent damage indicators. Several experiments are performed using a scanning laser vibrometer for sensing and a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) patch for actuation. The experimental results confirm the feasibility and accuracy of this boundary effect detection method in detecting multiple defects and identifying boundary conditions of beams."

These are the transmittance function, resonant comparison, operational deflection shape, and wave propagation methods. The methods are all based on measuring the vibration response of the blade when it is excited using piezoceramic actuator patches bonded to the blade. The vibration response of the blade is measured using either piezoceramic sensor patches bonded to the blade, or a scanning laser doppler vibrometer. The sensitivity of the techniques to detect a reversible damage simulated by a steel plate clamped to a section of a wind turbine blade is compared in this paper."

On the other hand, the brain regions involved and their functional interactions changed progressively over days of training. Regions associated with novelty, emotion, visuo-spatial orientation and motor aspects of the behavioral task seem to be relevant during the earlier phase of training, whereas a brain network comprising the prefrontal cortex was found along the whole learning process.

The inhibition of macrophage foam cell formation by tetrahydroxystilbene glucoside is driven by suppressing vimentin cytoskeleton,"Wenjuan Yao, Lei Huang, Qinju Sun, Lifeng Yang, Wei Zhang, ","Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, Volume 83, October 2016, Pages 1132-1140, ","Macrophage foam cell formation triggered by oxLDL is an important event that occurs during the development of atherosclerosis. 2,3,5,4∩-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-汕-d-glucoside (TSG) exhibits significant anti-atherosclerotic activity. Herein we used U937 cells induced by PMA and oxLDL in vitro to investigate the inhibitory effects of TSG on U937 differentiation and macrophage foam cell formation. TSG pretreatment markedly inhibited cell differentiation induced by PMA, macrophage apoptosis and foam cell formation induced by oxLDL. The inhibition of vimentin expression and cleavage was involved in these inhibitory effects of TSG. The suppression of vimentin by siRNA in U937 significantly inhibited cell differentiation, apoptosis and foam cell formation. Using inhibitors for TGF汕R1 and PI3K, we found that vimentin production in U937 cells is regulated by TGF汕/Smad signaling, but not by PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. Meanwhile, TSG pretreatment inhibited both the expression of TGF汕1 and the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, and TSG suppressed the nuclear translocation of Smad4 induced by PMA and oxLDL. Furthermore, TSG attenuated the induced caspase-3 activation and adhesion molecules levels by PMA and oxLDL. PMA and oxLDL increased the co-localization of vimentin with ICAM-1, which was attenuated by pretreatment with TSG. These results suggest that TSG inhibits macrophage foam cell formation through suppressing vimentin expression and cleavage, adhesion molecules expression and vimentin-ICAM-1 co-localization. The interruption of TGF汕/Smad pathway and caspase-3 activation is responsible for the downregulation of TSG on vimentin expression and degradation, respectively."
Energy absorption characteristics of sandwich structures with composite sheets and bio coconut core,"Taiqu Liu, Shujuan Hou, Xuantruong Nguyen, Xu Han, ","Composites Part B: Engineering, Volume 114, 1 April 2017, Pages 328-338, ","Composite materials has recently been widely used in the automotive, aerospace and other fields due to its light weight and good performance. At the same time, biological materials are also being paid more attentions in industrial application fields because of its economic, environmental, renewable and other advantages. Coconut mesocarp was chosen to be the core of composite sandwich structures with sheets of glass fiber reinforced plastics and carbon fiber reinforced composite were studied. Energy absorption behaviors were analyzed and compared. The thickness of all composite sheets is 1mm and the thickness of coconut mesocarp core is 20mm. Static compression tests were made by using universal testing machine. Results show that the composite sandwich structure with glass fiber reinforced plastic sheets and coconut mesocarp core has 1.0J/g of per weight energy absorption, which is higher than 0.91J/g of the composite sandwich structures with carbon fiber reinforced composite sheets and coconut mesocarp core. However, the peak crushing force of the former is less than the latter. Therefore, composite sandwich structures with glass fiber reinforced plastic sheets were selected for three points bending tests to study mechanical bending properties. By contrast with metal sheets sandwich structure and aluminum sheets sandwich structure, specific energy absorption of glass fiber reinforced plastic sheets sandwich structure is 2 times as much as metal sheets sandwich structure and 3每7 times as much as aluminum sheets sandwich structure, which shows an excellent crashworthiness performance of sandwich structures with composite sheets and bio coconut core."
"Does ＆Animal Fun＊ improve aiming and catching, and balance skills in young children?","Jorge A. De Oliveira, Daniela Rigoli, Robert Kane, Sue McLaren, Jan P.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the program＊s impact on children＊s aiming and catching, and balance skills.A cluster randomised control trial was employed, with six intervention and six control (following normal curriculum) schools. A total sample of 511 children (257 boys and 254 girls), aged 4每6 years presented at pre-test. Children were tested across three time points, pre-test, post intervention (six months later) and follow-up (18 months after pre-test), using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 Aiming and Catching, and Balance tasks. The study also tested for potential moderators including pre-test motor proficiency, age, gender, and cognitive performance.Participation in Animal Fun improved children＊s one leg balance at post-test and follow-up compared to control children, regardless of pre-test motor proficiency, age, gender, or pre-test cognitive performance. Participation in Animal Fun also improved throwing skills for those children with poorer motor proficiency compared to the controls with poorer motor performance. Interestingly, it was found that the control group＊s catching skills improved more than the intervention group at follow up.The study provides some promising results regarding the efficacy of the Animal Fun program in improving one-leg balance for all children, and throwing skills for those children with poorer motor proficiency, while also suggesting potential confounding factors, such as maturational issues and other individual factors (e.g., a child＊s participation in extracurricular activity)."

We believe that incorporation of intraoperative angiography during surgery in a hybrid theatre can help achieve a better cure.We present a 45 years old woman with three (3) years history of weakness and ten (10) days＊ history of acute pain in right upper extremity. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the cervical segment of spinal cord revealed tortuous vascular masses from foramen magnum to the inferior margin of fourth cervical (C4) vertebral. Spinal digital subtracting angiography (DSA) confirmed vascular malformation at the cervical segment of the spinal cord with their origin from bilateral posterior spinal arteries. She was successfully operated on with the aid of intraoperative angiography without any neurological deficient.Spinal angiography is the gold standard for all-inclusive assessment of SAVMs. Surgery and endovascular techniques equally have key therapeutic valves in treatment of SAVMs but a combination of the two gives a more accurate and reliable cure to this disorder.

LV ejection fraction and 3 parameters of LV diastolic function were measured with radionuclide ventriculography, whereas MR was assessed with Doppler echocardiography. LV ejection fraction was normal in 11 (27%) and depressed in 29 (73%) patients. Moderate or severe MR without LV diastolic dysfunction was common and equally prevalent in patients with and without LV systolic dysfunction (33 vs 38%; difference not significant). Diastolic dysfunction without MR was less frequent but equally prevalent in patients with and without systolic dysfunction (17 vs 27%; difference not significant). Two (18%) of 11 patients without and 12 (33%) of 36 patients with LV systolic dysfunction had both MR and LV diastolic dysfunction. Furthermore, MR was clinically silent and unsuspected in two-thirds of all patients with MR, regardless of a normal or depressed systolic function. These data show that there is a high prevalence of unrecognized moderate to severe MR in patients with acute pulmonary edema, regardless of the presence or absence of LV systolic dysfunction. Furthermore, the prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction without MR is relatively low even in patients with normal LV systolic function and pulmonary edema. Thus, unrecognized MR may be an important contributor to the syndrome of acute pulmonary edema in patients with normal or depressed LV systolic function."

This report provides newly developed standards for CRF reference values derived from cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) using cycle ergometry in the United States. Ten laboratories in the United States experienced in CPX administration with established quality control procedures contributed to the ※Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise: A National Database§ (FRIEND) Registry from April 2014 through May 2016. Data from 4494 maximal (respiratory exchange ratio, ≡1.1) cycle ergometer tests from men and women (20-79 years) from 27 states, without cardiovascular disease, were used to develop these references values. Percentiles of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) for men and women were determined for each decade from age 20 years through age 79 years. Comparisons of VO2max were made to reference data established with CPX data from treadmill data in the FRIEND Registry and previously published reports. As expected, there were significant differences between sex and age groups for VO2max (P<.01). For cycle tests within the FRIEND Registry, the 50th percentile VO2max of men and women aged 20 to 29 years declined from 41.9 and 31.0 mLO2/kg/min to 19.5 and 14.8 mLO2/kg/min for ages 70 to 79 years, respectively. The rate of decline in this cohort was approximately 10% per decade. The FRIEND Registry reference data will be useful in providing more accurate interpretations for the US population of CPX-measured VO2max from exercise tests using cycle ergometry compared with previous approaches based on estimations of standard differences from treadmill testing reference values."
Large-deformation tests and total-Lagrangian finite-element analyses of flexible beams,"P. Frank Pai, Tony J. Anderson, Eric A. Wheater, ","International Journal of Solids and Structures, Volume 37, Issue 21, 1 May 2000, Pages 2951-2980, ","Presented here is a total-Lagrangian displacement-based finite-element formulation for general anisotropic beams undergoing large displacements and rotations. The theory fully accounts for geometric nonlinearities (large rotations), general initial curvatures, and extensionality by using Jaumann stress and strain measures, an exact coordinate transformation, and a new concept of orthogonal virtual rotations. Moreover, transverse shear deformations are accounted for by using a first-order shear-deformation theory. To verify the accuracy of the finite-element model, two test fixtures have been built for bending and twisting experiments. Large static deformation tests of beams with different loading conditions have been performed. The finite-element results agree closely with the experimental results and numerically exact solutions obtained by using a multiple shooting method to solve for post-buckling deformations of highly flexible beams undergoing large static rotations and displacements in three-dimensional space."

Findings are based on American (n=8563) and Canadian (n=8990) youth in grades 6每10 from the 2005/06 Health Behavior in School-Aged Children Survey. Weekly hours of individual screen time behaviors were calculated. Urban每rural status was defined using the Beale coding system. Parent and peer support variables were derived from principal component analysis. In comparison to the referent group (non-metro adjacent), American youth in the most rural areas were more likely to be high television users and less likely to be high computer users. Conversely, Canadian youth in medium and large metropolitan areas were less likely to be high television users and more likely to be high computer users. Parent and peer support did not strongly mediate the relationships between urban每rural status and screen time. These findings suggest that interventions aiming to reduce screen time may be most effective if they consider residential location and the specific screen time behavior."

In this work, the challenge of further improving the fuel economy and extending the driving range of a fuel cell vehicle is addressed by a dual-stack fuel cell system with specific energy management strategies. An efficiency optimization strategy and an instantaneous optimization strategy are proposed. Simulation validation for each strategy is conducted based on a dual-stack fuel cell electric vehicle model which follows the new European driving cycle (NEDC). Simulation results show that a dual-stack fuel cell system with proposed energy management strategies can significantly improve the fuel economy of a fuel cell vehicle and thus lengthen the driving range while being able to keep the start-stop frequency of the fuel cell stack within a reasonable range."

It was intriguing to notice that the 汐3汛 macrocycles got stabilized by both 10-membered 汕-turn as well as a seven-membered 污-turn, fused within the same macrocycle. The presence of fused sub-structures within a 15-membered macrocycle is rare to see. Also, the stereocenter variation at C5 did not affect the fused turn structures and exhibited similar conformations in both the series.

International challenge to predict the impact of radioxenon releases from medical isotope production on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty sampling station,"Paul W. Eslinger, Ted W.

At entry-into-force, half of the 80 radionuclide stations will be able to measure concentrations of several radioactive xenon isotopes produced in nuclear explosions, and then the full network may be populated with xenon monitoring afterward. An understanding of natural and man-made radionuclide backgrounds can be used in accordance with the provisions of the treaty (such as event screening criteria in Annex 2 to the Protocol of the Treaty) for the effective implementation of the verification regime.Fission-based production of 99Mo for medical purposes also generates nuisance radioxenon isotopes that are usually vented to the atmosphere. One of the ways to account for the effect emissions from medical isotope production has on radionuclide samples from the IMS is to use stack monitoring data, if they are available, and atmospheric transport modeling. Recently, individuals from seven nations participated in a challenge exercise that used atmospheric transport modeling to predict the time-history of 133Xe concentration measurements at the IMS radionuclide station in Germany using stack monitoring data from a medical isotope production facility in Belgium. Participants received only stack monitoring data and used the atmospheric transport model and meteorological data of their choice.Some of the models predicted the highest measured concentrations quite well. A model comparison rank and ensemble analysis suggests that combining multiple models may provide more accurate predicted concentrations than any single model. None of the submissions based only on the stack monitoring data predicted the small measured concentrations very well. Modeling of sources by other nuclear facilities with smaller releases than medical isotope production facilities may be important in understanding how to discriminate those releases from releases from a nuclear explosion."
Solving a type of biobjective bilevel programming problem using NSGA-II,"Minqiang Li, Dan Lin, Shouyang Wang, ","Computers & Mathematics with Applications, Volume 59, Issue 2, January 2010, Pages 706-715, ","This paper considers a type of biobjective bilevel programming problem, which is derived from a single objective bilevel programming problem via lifting the objective function at the lower level up to the upper level. The efficient solutions to such a model can be considered as candidates for the after optimization bargaining between the decision-makers at both levels who retain the original bilevel decision-making structure. We use a popular multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, NSGA-II, to solve this type of problem. The algorithm is tested on some small-dimensional benchmark problems from the literature. Computational results show that the NSGA-II algorithm is capable of solving the problems efficiently and effectively. Hence, it provides a promising visualization tool to help the decision-makers find the best trade-off in bargaining."

The surface plasmon resonance absorbance properties in the visible spectroscopy region of gold colloids make them useful tools in medical devices, as the colloids are directly visible to the naked eye.Despite the relative ease with which gold-protein conjugates can be prepared a major issue is the manufacture of poor-quality and poorly characterised bioconjugates that can result in the under performance of subsequent diagnostic tests. This paper describes the preparation of good-quality conjugates for use in immunoassays by optimising the adsorption of antibodies onto the surface of gold colloids, followed by their subsequent characterisation. The conjugates were characterized for size, aggregation and quality using a range of techniques: UV每visible (UV/Vis) absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The biological activities of the conjugated products were also assessed using an immunoassay format and electrochemical measurements.By utilising a number of measurement techniques we aimed to gain a better understanding of the extent of particle aggregation, and the resulting stability and activity of the biological molecule on the surfaces of nanoparticles. The tools developed will enable researchers and companies to ensure the sensitivity, quality and reproducibility of batches of nanoparticle bio-conjugates."
"Location-related thermal history, microstructure, and mechanical properties of arc additively manufactured 2Cr13 steel using cold metal transfer welding","Jinguo Ge, Jian Lin, Yongping Lei, Hanguang Fu, ","Materials Science and Engineering: A, Volume 715, 7 February 2018, Pages 144-153, ","The wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) 2Cr13 thin-wall part was deposited using robotic cold metal transfer (CMT) technology, and the location-related thermal history, densification, phase identification, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the part were explored. The results show that pre-heating effect from previously built layers can be effectively used to reduce residual stresses; cooling rate firstly decreased rapidly and then kept stable in the 15th每25th layers. The peaks of the 汐-Fe phase of the AM part drifted slightly toward a relatively smaller Bragg's angle as a result of solute atoms incorporation when compared with that of the base metal. Small amounts of pores were present with the absence of cracks in different layers, being indicative of a high densification level. As-deposited microstructure consisted of martensite and ferrite, along with (Fe, Cr)23C6 phase precipitated at 汐-Fe grain boundaries. Martensite content increased gradually from the 5th layer to the 25th layers, indicating that metastable martensite partly decomposed into stable ferrite due to the carbon atoms diffusion. The hardness and UTS changed slightly in the 05th每15th layers and then increased quickly from the 20th layer to the 25th layers at the expense of ductility; the fracture process transformed from ductile (01st每10th layers) to mixed-mode (15th每20th layers), and finally to brittle fracture (25th layer). The findings above suggest that, despite the emergency of few pores and slightly inadequate ductility, this robotic CMT technology is a feasible method to obtain desired microstructures and enhanced mechanical properties for the WAAM 2Cr13 part in comparison with its as-solutioned counterpart."

An Analytical Network Process model for risks prioritisation in megaprojects,"Prince Boateng, Zhen Chen, Stephen O. Ogunlana, ","International Journal of Project Management, Volume 33, Issue 8, November 2015, Pages 1795-1811, ","Megaprojects are complex and expensive projects that often involve social, technical, economic, environmental and political (STEEP) challenges to project management. Despite these challenges, project owners and financiers continue to invest large sums of money in megaprojects that run high risks of being over schedule and over budget. While some degree of cost and schedule risks are considered during project planning, the challenge of modelling risks interactions and impacts on project performance still remains. To tackle this technical problem, this research adopted the Analytical Network Process and combined it with a new Risk Priority Index as an innovative approach to model risks analytically based on data collected from the Edinburgh Tram Network project at the construction phase. The approach provides an interactive way for developers to prioritise risks across the project supply network and to initiate timely mitigation strategies against significant cost and time consequences of STEEP risks on megaproject performance."
NON-LINEAR VIBRATION ABSORBERS USING HIGHER ORDER INTERNAL RESONANCES,"P. FRANK PAI, BERND ROMMEL, MARK J.

PZT (lead zirconate titanate) patches are used as control actuators and sensors. Linear second order controllers are designed to couple with the plate via different orders of non-linear terms to establish energy bridges between the plate and controllers. Each linear second-order controller is designed to have a 1:2 or 1:3 or 1:4 internal resonance with one of the plate's vibration modes and hence is able to exchange energy with the plate around the specific modal frequency. Because of non-linearities and internal resonances, different orders of saturation phenomena exist and are used to suppress modal vibrations. Several non-linear vibration absorbers are designed based on the saturation phenomena and are analyzed to show their feasibility and efficiency. Perturbation analysis, direct numerical integration, and experiments are performed to validate these non-linear vibration absorbers."

Yeast cell disruption strategies for recovery of intracellular bio-active compounds 〞 A review,"Dan Liu, Lijun Ding, Jianxia Sun, Nadia Boussetta, Eug豕ne Vorobiev, ","Innovative Food Science & Emerging Technologies, Volume 36, August 2016, Pages 181-192, ","Yeasts are cheap, attractive and easily available residual sources of valuable bio-active compounds. Extraction of these compounds requires to break the yeast cells. So efficient damage of cell wall has become an important issue to be resolved. The aim of this paper is to review the potential of some emerging cell disruption techniques for recovery of intracellular bio-active compounds from Baker's yeast including mechanical (bead mill, high pressure homogenization, ultrasonication), and non-mechanical (electrical, physical, chemical and enzymatic) techniques, as well as some newly developed methods. The advantages and drawbacks of different cell disruption methods were summarized by considering the energy consumption, the interaction of the disruption methods with downstream operations and the process economics of alternative strategies. Finally, some future directions for research areas are proposed.Wine making process entails the generation of significant amount of waste yeast, which represents an attractive source of valuable compounds that has been relatively unexploited to date. To retain the valuable cell content, effective cell disruption strategies are needed to break the rigid yeast cell walls. This review summarizes the state of the art of some emerging cell disruption techniques for recovery of intracellular bio-active compounds from yeasts including mechanical (bead mill, high pressure homogenizer, ultrasonication), and non-mechanical (electrical, physical, chemical and enzymatic) techniques. Thereby, it identifies the process economics of alternative strategies by considering the interaction of the disruption methods with downstream operations as well as the current situations and future research needs."
Mechanical effects of the surface ectoderm on optic vesicle morphogenesis in the chick embryo,"Hadi S. Hosseini, David C. Beebe, Larry A. Taber, ","Journal of Biomechanics, Volume 47, Issue 16, 18 December 2014, Pages 3837-3846, ","Precise shaping of the eye is crucial for proper vision. Here, we use experiments on chick embryos along with computational models to examine the mechanical factors involved in the formation of the optic vesicles (OVs), which grow outward from the forebrain of the early embryo. First, mechanical dissections were used to remove the surface ectoderm (SE), a membrane that contacts the outer surfaces of the OVs. Principal components analysis of OV shapes suggests that the SE exerts asymmetric loads that cause the OVs to flatten and shear caudally during the earliest stages of eye development and later to bend in the caudal and dorsal directions. These deformations cause the initially spherical OVs to become pear-shaped. Exposure to the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin reduced these effects, suggesting that cytoskeletal contraction controls OV shape by regulating tension in the SE. To test the physical plausibility of these interpretations, we developed 2-D finite-element models for frontal and transverse cross-sections of the forebrain, including frictionless contact between the SE and OVs. With geometric data used to specify differential growth in the OVs, these models were used to simulate each experiment (control, SE removed, no contraction). For each case, the predicted shape of the OV agrees reasonably well with experiments. The results of this study indicate that differential growth in the OV and external pressure exerted by the SE are sufficient to cause the global changes in OV shape observed during the earliest stages of eye development."
Effect of enthalpy exchanger on reducing frost accumulation on evaporator in frost-free refrigerator,"Zhiqiang Li, Dan Zhao, Guoliang Ding, Tao Ren, Xiaolei Han, ","International Journal of Refrigeration, Volume 89, May 2018, Pages 51-60, ","Performance of a frost-free refrigerator may be deteriorated by frost accumulation on its evaporator surface. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using an enthalpy exchanger (EE) to reduce the frost accumulation on evaporator surface in frost-free refrigerator. The influence of EE on air circulation and the change process of air humidity is analyzed, and it is indicated that the application of EE is capable to decrease the amount of water vapor entering the evaporator and consequently reduce the frost accumulation on evaporator surface. The design process of EE in frost-free refrigerator is illustrated, and an optimal type of EE is presented. An experiment on a frost-free refrigerator shows that the application of EE decreases the frost accumulation by 18.8%. In addition, effects of EE on other main performances of frost-free refrigerator besides the frost accumulation are evaluated."

The adolescents had been exposed to a broad range of maternal drinking patterns before birth, most reflecting ※social§ levels of drinking. The three computer-administered tasks were the Nissen sequence learning task, a spatial-visual reasoning task, and an RSVP assessment of reading speed, memory, and comprehension. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis combined 13 measures of maternal drinking into a latent variable score for dose significantly related to a similarly computed cognitive processing latent variable combining 25 outcome measures. Alcohol-related deficits on the tasks were well summarized by a single new index: a speed-accuracy tradeoff on the spatial-visual reasoning task."

The stochastic volatility diffusion models are first discretized into forms that are amenable for designing the lattice approach, then the paths of the underlying volatility are generated by the lattice, and finally the valuation of the American volatility options is realized by the backward processes. One of the keys to the designing of the lattice approach is to derive the probability distributions of the underlying volatility on the lattice-nodes. Numerical analysis is given to confirm the accuracy of the pricing methods. Also some empirical applications are provided in the paper."

Consequently, the resulting numerical schemes have significantly increased computational work and memory requirement. We develop a lossless fast numerical method for the accurate and efficient numerical simulation of the space每time fractional phase-field model.

In this phase 3 trial, we aimed to determine the clinical effect of adding IMA901 to sunitinib, the standard first-line treatment in metastatic renal cell carcinoma with postulated favourable immunomodulatory effects.The IMPRINT study is an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial done at 124 clinical sites in 11 countries. HLA-A*02-positive patients (aged ≡18 years) with treatment-naive, histologically confirmed metastatic or locally advanced (or both) clear-cell renal cell carcinoma were randomly assigned (3:2) to receive sunitinib plus up to ten intradermal vaccinations of IMA901 (4﹞13 mg) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (75 米g), with one dose of cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2) 3 days before the first vaccination, or to receive sunitinib alone. Sunitinib (50 mg) was given orally once daily, with each cycle defined as 4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off treatment, until progression of disease as determined by the investigator, death, or withdrawal of consent. Block randomisation (block size five) was done centrally using an interactive web response system, stratified by prognostic risk, geographical region, and previous nephrectomy. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival from randomisation until death of any cause as determined by the investigator, analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01265901.Between Dec 22, 2010, and Dec 15, 2012, we screened 1171 patients, of whom 339 were randomly assigned to receive sunitinib plus IMA901 (n=204) or sunitinib monotherapy (n=135). Patients had a median follow-up of 33﹞27 months (IQR 29﹞92每35﹞64). Median overall survival did not differ significantly between the groups (33﹞17 months [95% CI 27﹞81每41﹞36] in the sunitinib plus IMA901 group vs not reached [33﹞67每not reached] in the sunitinib monotherapy group; hazard ratio 1﹞34 [0﹞96每1﹞86]; p=0﹞087). 116 (57%) of 202 patients in the sunitinib plus IMA901 group and 62 (47%) of 132 in the sunitinib group had grade 3 or worse adverse events, the most common of which were hypertension, neutropenia, and anaemia in both groups, and mild-to-moderate transient injection-site reactions (eg, erythema, pruritus) were the most frequent IMA901-related side-effect in the sunitinib plus IMA901 group. Serious adverse events leading to death occurred in four (2%) patients (one respiratory failure and circulatory collapse [possibly related to sunitinib], one oesophageal varices haemorrhage [possibly related to sunitinib], one cardiac arrest [possibly related to sunitinib], and one myocardial infarction) and eight (6%) patients in the sunitinib group (one case each of renal failure, oesophageal varices haemorrhage, circulatory collapse, wound infection, ileus, cerebrovascular accident [possibly treatment related], and sepsis).IMA901 did not improve overall survival when added to sunitinib as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The magnitude of immune responses needs to be improved before further development of IMA901 in this disease is indicated.Immatics Biotechnologies."

The physical meaning of a shear correction factor is shown to be the ratio of the geometric average to the energy average of the transverse shear strain on a cross section. Examples are shown for circular and rectangular cross sections, and the obtained shear correction factors are compared with those of Cowper (1966) .

An approach to job shop scheduling with sequence-dependent setups,"Xiaoqing Sun, James S. Noble, ","Journal of Manufacturing Systems, Volume 18, Issue 6, 1999, Pages 416-430, ","This paper addresses the job shop scheduling problem with release dates, due dates, and sequence-dependent setup times with the scheduling objective to minimize the weighted sum of squared tardiness. Because the problem is NP-hard, it is decomposed into a series of single-machine scheduling problems within a shifting bottleneck framework. Machines are scheduled one at a time in the order of criticality. The measure of criticality developed is closely related to the job shop scheduling objective and is based on the marginal contribution of a machine to the overall scheduling objective function. The single-machine scheduling problem is solved using a Lagrangian relaxation based approach (LRSSS).The modified shifting bottleneck approach to job shop scheduling with sequence-dependent setups (MSBSS) is compared with the EDD (earliest due date), ATCS (apparent tardiness cost), and SIMSET (similar setup times) dispatching rules. The MSBSS approach results in superior solution quality compared to the results of the other dispatching rules in reasonable computational time."

We find that the public sector has undergone substantial labor retrenchment. The removal of employment guarantees for state workers has led to substantial employment shifts both within and between sectors. As compared to many Central and East European countries and the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States in their early phases of transition, China has experienced a more synchronized pace of job destruction and creation as well as higher rates of excessive reallocation. Our results also show that the employment adjustment and downsizing process has been driven largely by market forces.

Cardiovascular Toxicity of Nicotine: Implications for Nicotine Replacement Therapy ,"Neal L Benowitz, Steven G Gourlay, ","Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Volume 29, Issue 7, June 1997, Pages 1422-1431, ","This review discusses the known cardiovascular effects of smoking and the effects of nicotine without tobacco smoke and interprets the available data on cardiovascular risk during nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Nicotine gum and patches are now approved for over the counter sale in the United States. Smokers with cardiovascular disease are advised to seek physician counseling before using nicotine products, but information regarding the safety of these products in such patients is not readily available to most physicians. Nicotine may contribute to cardiovascular disease, presumably by hemodynamic consequences of sympathetic neural stimulation and systemic catecholamine release. However, there are many potential cardiovascular toxins in cigarette smoke other than nicotine. The doses of nicotine obtained by regular cigarette smoking generally exceed those delivered by NRTs, and the cardiovascular effects of nicotine are, in general, more intense when delivered rapidly by cigarette smoking than the slower delivery by transdermal nicotine or nicotine gum. Because the dose每cardiovascular response relation for nicotine is flat, the effects of cigarette smoking in conjunction with NRT are similar to those of cigarette smoking alone. Cigarette smoking increases blood coagulability, a major risk factor for acute cardiovascular events, whereas transdermal nicotine does not appear to do so. Clinical trials of NRT in patients with underlying, stable coronary disease suggest that nicotine does not increase cardiovascular risk. At worst, the risks of NRT are no more than those of cigarette smoking. The risks of NRT for smokers, even for those with underlying cardiovascular disease, are small and are substantially outweighed by the potential benefits of smoking cessation.(J Am Coll Cardiol 1997;29:1422每31)"

The purpose of this research is to explore to what extent initial cracks affect the mechanical performance of bolted glulam joints. Experiments were conducted on full-scale specimens with different bolt diameters, bolt layouts, and combinations of different crack patterns (e.g. crack length, location, etc.) were considered. This paper presents the failure modes and the reduction in several mechanical parameters of cracked glulam joints. It is found that initial cracks have a significant effect on the mechanical behavior of the joints. The cracks lead to a reduction up to 52% in the stiffness and a reduction up to 61% in the ductility ratio of the joints, respectively. In addition, an analytical method based on the yield theory and fracture mechanics was proposed to predict the load carrying capacity of the cracked glulam joints, and the proposed model was further verified by the experimental results.Download high-res image (196KB)Download full-size image"
MicroRNA-140-5p aggravates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by promoting myocardial oxidative stress via targeting Nrf2 and Sirt2,"Lisha Zhao, Yan Qi, Lina Xu, Xufeng Tao, Jinyong Peng, ","Redox Biology, Volume 15, May 2018, Pages 284-296, ","Clinical application of doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline antibiotic with potent anti- tumor effects, is limited because of its cardiotoxicity. However, its pathogenesis is still not entirely understood. The aim of this paper was to explore the mechanisms and new drug targets to treat DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The in vitro model on H9C2 cells and the in vivo models on rats and mice were developed. The results showed that DOX markedly decreased H9C2 cell viability, increased the levels of CK, LDH, caused histopathological and ECG changes in rats and mice, and triggered myocardial oxidative damage via adjusting the levels of intracellular ROS, MDA, SOD, GSH and GSH-Px. Total of 18 differentially expressed microRNAs in rat heart tissue caused by DOX were screened out using microRNA microarray assay, especially showing that miR-140-5p was significantly increased by DOX which was selected as the target miRNA. Double-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-140-5p directly targeted Nrf2 and Sirt2, as a result of affecting the expression levels of HO-1, NQO1, Gst, GCLM, Keap1 and FOXO3a, and thereby increasing DOX-caused myocardial oxidative damage. In addition, the levels of intracellular ROS were significantly increased or decreased in H9C2 cells treated with DOX after miR-140-5p mimic or miR-140-5p inhibitor transfection, respectively, as well as the changed expression levels of Nrf2 and Sirt2. Furthermore, DOX- induced myocardial oxidative damage was worsened in mice treated with miR-140-5p agomir, and however the injury was alleviated in the mice administrated with miR-140-5p antagomir. Therefore, miR-140-5p plays an important role in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by promoting myocardial oxidative stress via targeting Nrf2 and Sirt2. Our data provide novel insights for investigating DOX-induced heart injury. In addition, miR-140-5p/ Nrf2 and miR-140-5p/Sirt2 may be the new targets to treat DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.Download high-res image (241KB)Download full-size image"
Plasma oxytocin levels predict social cue recognition in individuals with schizophrenia,"Gregory P. Strauss, William R. Keller, James I. Koenig, James M. Gold, Robert W. Buchanan, ","Schizophrenia Research, Volume 162, Issues 1每3, March 2015, Pages 47-51, ","Lower endogenous levels of the neuropeptide oxytocin may be an important biological predictor of social cognition impairments in schizophrenia (SZ). Prior studies have demonstrated that lower-level social cognitive processes (e.g., facial affect perception) are significantly associated with reduced plasma oxytocin levels in SZ; however, it is unclear whether higher-level social cognition, which requires inferential processes and knowledge not directly presented in the stimulus, is associated with endogenous oxytocin. The current study explored the association between endogenous oxytocin levels and lower- and higher-level social cognition in 40 individuals diagnosed with SZ and 22 demographically matched healthy controls (CN). All participants received the Social Cue Recognition Test (SCRT), which presents participants with videotaped interpersonal vignettes and subsequent true/false questions related to concrete or abstract aspects of social interactions in the vignettes. Results indicated that SZ had significantly higher plasma oxytocin concentrations than CN. SZ and CN did not differ on SCRT hits, but SZ had more false positives and lower sensitivity scores than CN. Higher plasma oxytocin levels were associated with better sensitivity scores for abstract items in CN and fewer false positives for concrete items in individuals with SZ. Findings indicate that endogenous oxytocin levels predict accurate encoding of lower-level socially relevant information in SZ."
The anti-estrogenic activity of sediments from agriculturally intense watersheds: Assessment using in vivo and in vitro assays,"Marlo K. Sellin Jeffries, Nicholas H. Conoan, Marc B. Cox, Jodi L. Sangster, Alan S. Kolok, ","Aquatic Toxicology, Volume 105, Issues 1每2, September 2011, Pages 189-198, ","The goal of the current study was to determine whether sediments from agriculturally intense watersheds can act as a potential source of anti-estrogenic endocrine-disrupting compounds. The specific objectives of the current study were to determine (1) whether female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) experience alterations in endocrine function when exposed to sediments collected from agriculturally intense watersheds and (2) if these sediments display anti-estrogenic activity in an in vitro assay. In addition, sediment samples were analyzed for the presence of steroid hormones and pesticides associated with local agricultural practices. To accomplish this, sediments and water were collected from three sites within two agriculturally intense Nebraska watersheds (Bow Creek and the Elkhorn River). In 2009, minnows were exposed to sediment and/or water collected from the two Bow Creek sites (East Bow Creek and the Confluence) in the laboratory, while in 2010, minnows were exposed to sediment and/or water from East Bow Creek, the Confluence and the Elkhorn River. Following the 7-day exposure period, the hepatic mRNA expression of two-estrogen responsive genes, estrogen receptor 汐 (ER汐) and vitellogenin (Vtg) was determined. In 2009, females exposed to Confluence sediments, in the presence of laboratory water or Confluence water, experienced significant reductions in ER汐 expression relative to unexposed and Confluence water-exposed females. The defeminization of these females suggests the presence of a biologically available anti-estrogenic compound in sediments collected from this site. In 2010, sediments were assessed for anti-estrogenic activity on days 0 and 7 of the exposure period using a 4-h yeast estrogen screen. Lipophilic extracts (LEs) of day 0 sediments collected from the Confluence and the Elkhorn River induced significant reductions in the estrogenic reporter activity of treated yeast cultures suggesting the presence of a lipophilic anti-estrogenic compound in these extracts. Chemical analysis revealed the presence of a variety of steroid hormones, including those associated with the production of beef cattle (i.e. 汕-trenbolone, 汐-zearalanol and 汐-zearalenol), in sediments indicating that compounds utilized by local beef cattle operations are capable of entering nearby watersheds. Overall, the results of this study indicate that an environmentally relevant anti-estrogenic compound is present in sediments from agriculturally intense watersheds and that this compound is bioavailable to fish. Furthermore, the presence of steroid hormones in sediments from these watersheds provides evidence indicating that steroids are capable of sorbing to sediments."

Incorporating homeowners' preferences of heating technologies in the UK TIMES model,"Pei-Hao Li, Ilkka Keppo, Neil Strachan, ","Energy, Volume 148, 1 April 2018, Pages 716-727, ","Hot water and space heating account for about 80% of total energy consumption in the residential sector in the UK. It is thus crucial to decarbonise residential heating to achieve UK's 2050 greenhouse gas reduction targets. However, the decarbonisation transitions determined by most techno-economic energy system models might be too optimistic or misleading for relying on cost minimisation alone and not considering households' preferences for different heating technologies. This study thus proposes a novel framework to incorporate heterogeneous households' (HHs) preferences into the modelling process of the UK TIMES model. The incorporated preferences for HHs are based on a nationwide survey on homeowners' choices of heating technologies. Preference constraints are then applied to regulate the HHs' choices of heating technologies to reflect the survey results. Consequently, compared to the least-cost transition pathway, the preference-driven pathway adopts heating technologies gradually without abrupt increases of market shares. Heat pumps and electric heaters are deployed much less than in the cost optimal result. Extensive district heating using low-carbon fuels and conservation measures should thus be deployed to provide flexibility for decarbonisation. The proposed framework can also incorporate preferences for other energy consumption technologies and be applied to other linear programming-based energy system models."

The abstract proceedings of meetings sponsored by the American Brachytherapy Society and the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology were reviewed to identify additional relevant material. These sources provided the basis for a concise review of the rationale and advantages of high-dose-rate brachytherapy in the management of localized prostate cancer, as well as the details of the clinical use and therapeutic outcomes of this treatment as observed in a contemporaneous time frame."
Monochromatic and bichromatic mutual skyline queries,"Tao Jiang, Yunjun Gao, Bin Zhang, Dan Lin, Qing Li, ","Expert Systems with Applications, Volume 41, Issue 4, Part 2, March 2014, Pages 1885-1900, ","In this paper, we study a new skyline operator, namely, mutual skyline query (MSQ), which retrieves all the data objects that are contained in the dynamic skyline and meanwhile the reverse skyline of a specified query object q. MSQ has many applications such as marketing analysis, task allocation, and personalized matching. Motivated by this, we first formalize MSQ in both monochromatic and bichromatic cases, and then propose several algorithms for processing MSQ. Our methods utilize a conventional data-partitioning index on the dataset, employ the advantage of reusing technique, and exploit effective pruning heuristics to improve the query processing. Extensive experiments using both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms under various experimental settings."
Effect of cerclage on obstetrical outcome in twin gestations with a shortened cervical length,"Roger B. Newman, R. Stephen Krombach, Mary C. Myers, Daniel L. McGee, ","American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Volume 186, Issue 4, April 2002, Pages 634-640, ","Objective: Our purpose was to determine the impact of cerclage placement on obstetric outcome in twin gestations with a shortened cervical length. Study design: A prospective cohort study of 147 consecutive twin pregnancies (July 1994 to March 2001) who underwent transvaginal ultrasonographic cervical length measurement between 18 and 26 weeks' gestation. Cerclage was offered to women with cervical lengths ≒25 mm. Patients were segregated into quartiles by cervical length. Regression analysis and 聿2 tests were used to determine the effect of cervical length and cerclage on parameters of prematurity. Results: One hundred twenty-eight twin gestations met inclusion criteria, including 21 (16.4%) who underwent cerclage for a cervical length ≒25 mm. Decreasing cervical length was significantly associated with a shorter length of gestation, lower combined birth weight, delivery at ≒34 weeks, preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes, and very low birth weight. None of these outcomes was altered by cerclage placement. Conclusion: Midtrimester cerclage does not alter the risks of prematurity associated with a shortened cervical length in twin gestations.

Nonlinear complex response of a parametrically excited tuning fork,"Yongsik Lee, P. Frank Pai, Z. C. Feng, ","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, Volume 22, Issue 5, July 2008, Pages 1146-1156, ","Innovative applications of parametrically excited structures have been proposed in microelectromechanical sensors and actuators. In parametrically excited systems, the dynamic response is a result of instability of the trivial equilibrium state. The response amplitude is determined by the nonlinearity of the structure as well as the system damping and forcing parameters. Previous studies on parametrically excited cantilever beams have shown that the agreement between the theory and the experiment is very poor. Even qualitative differences have been reported in the beam frequency response curves of the first mode. These discrepancies have led to more sophisticated models including quadratic dampings in the models. However, this treatment has been found unsatisfactory since it would require different nonlinear damping models for different modes. In this paper, we propose that much of the discrepancy can be attributed to the limited power of the shaker. In fact, the shaker dynamic responses are affected by the beam dynamics upon parametric instabilities. We first report qualitative discrepancies between the theoretical predictions and the experiments. We then propose as the explanation for the discrepancy the coupling between the beam lateral vibration and the shaker vibration amplitude. The coupling is more significant in shakers of limited powers. This finding is important in the design of parametrically excited systems for engineering applications."
Drainage network extraction from a high-resolution DEM using parallel programming in the .NET Framework,"Chao Du, Aizhong Ye, Yanjun Gan, Jinjun You, Jingwen Hou, ","Journal of Hydrology, Volume 555, December 2017, Pages 506-517, ","High-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) can be used to extract high-accuracy prerequisite drainage networks. A higher resolution represents a larger number of grids. With an increase in the number of grids, the flow direction determination will require substantial computer resources and computing time. Parallel computing is a feasible method with which to resolve this problem. In this paper, we proposed a parallel programming method within the .NET Framework with a C# Compiler in a Windows environment. The basin is divided into sub-basins, and subsequently the different sub-basins operate on multiple threads concurrently to calculate flow directions. The method was applied to calculate the flow direction of the Yellow River basin from 3 arc-second resolution SRTM DEM. Drainage networks were extracted and compared with HydroSHEDS river network to assess their accuracy. The results demonstrate that this method can calculate the flow direction from high-resolution DEMs efficiently and extract high-precision continuous drainage networks."
Effects of solid solution treatment and cooling on morphology of LPSO phase and precipitation hardening behavior of Mg每Dy每Ni alloy,"Li-tao YUAN, Guang-li BI, Yuan-dong LI, Jing JIANG, Ying MA, ","Transactions of Nonferrous Metals Society of China, Volume 27, Issue 11, November 2017, Pages 2381-2389, ","Effects of solid solution treatment and cooling on the morphology of long period stacking order (LPSO) phase and precipitation hardening behavior of Mg每2Dy每0.5Ni (molar fraction, %) alloy were investigated. Microstructures of the as-cast alloy mainly consisted of 汐-Mg phase, bamboo-like Mg12DyNi phase with LPSO structure distributed between dendrites and small amounts of cubic Dy phases. During solid solution treatment at 565 ∼C for 12 h and subsequent different cooling conditions, dot-shaped, block, fine lamellar and rod-shaped LPSO phases precipitate in Mg matrix, respectively. For continuous cooling conditions (furnace and air cooling), the fine lamellar LPSO phase generally forms in grain interior and its volume fraction increases and block LPSO phase coarsens with increasing cooling time. For discontinuous cooling conditions (air cooling after furnace cooling to 415 and 265 ∼C), the dot-shaped LPSO grows into the rod-shaped phase, which results in an decrease of cooling hardening behavior of alloy."
Bilayer Thickness Modulates the Conductance of the BK Channel in Model Membranes,"Chunbo Yuan, Robert J. O＊Connell, Paula L. Feinberg-Zadek, Linda J. Johnston, Steven N. Treistman, ","Biophysical Journal, Volume 86, Issue 6, June 2004, Pages 3620-3633, ","The conductance of the BK channel was evaluated in reconstituted bilayers made of POPE/POPS (3.3:1), or POPE/POPS with an added 20% of either SPM (3.3:1:1), CER (3.3:1:1), or CHL (3.3:1:1). The presence of SPM, which is known to increase bilayer thickness, significantly reduced the conductance of the BK channel. To directly test the role of membrane thickness, the conductance of the BK channel was measured in bilayers formed from PCs with acyl chains of increasing length (C14:1每C24:1), all in the absence of SPM. Slope conductance was maximal at a chain length of (C18:1) and much reduced for both thinner (C14:1) and thicker (C24:1) bilayers, indicating that membrane thickness alone can modify slope conductance. Further, in a simplified binary mixture of DOPE/SPM that forms a confined, phase-separated bilayer, the measured conductance of BK channels shows a clear bimodal distribution. In contrast, the addition of CER, which has an acyl chain structure similar to SPM but without its bulky polar head group to POPE/POPS, was without effect, as was the addition of CHL. The surface structure of membranes made from these same lipid mixtures was examined with AFM. Incorporation of both SPM and CER resulted in the formation of microdomains in POPE/POPS monolayers, but only SPM promoted a substantial increase in the amount of the high phase observed for the corresponding bilayers. The addition of CHL to POPE/POPS eliminated the phase separation observed in the POPE/POPS bilayer. The decrease in channel conductance observed with the incorporation of SPM into POPE/POPS membranes was, therefore, attributed to larger SPM-rich domains that appear thicker than the neighboring bilayer."
Normal and tangential oil film stiffness of modified spur gear with non-Newtonian elastohydrodynamic lubrication,"Changjiang Zhou, Zeliang Xiao, Siyu Chen, Xu Han, ","Tribology International, Volume 109, May 2017, Pages 319-327, ","A new normal stiffness model of the oil film is established by the viscous-elastic fluid between a spur gear drive being equivalent to a massless spring element, and the tangential stiffness model is proposed according to the hypothesis of equal shear stress on laminar element surfaces. Effects of operating parameters (contact force and rotation speed) and geometry parameters (module, tooth number, pressure angle and modification) on the oil film stiffness from the root to the tip are investigated. The results show that the amplitude and fluctuation of the stiffness are closely related to the shear rate, effective viscosity and curvature radii. It is indicated that the rational parameter match is valid in mesh impact reduction and stationarity enhancement."

The highly purified, monomeric A41Fabp246 was then evaluated for hemagglutination-based detection of anti-p24 antibodies using sera from HIV-infected individuals. This derivative of p24 is devoid of maximum homology region and the C-terminal domain of p24, which is responsible for oligomerization of p24, but retains full complement of immunodominant epitopes. This new fusion protein in combination with fusion proteins consisting of monovalent fragment of another anti-human RBC antibody fused to immunodominant regions of envelope glycoproteins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 should be useful in preparing a cocktail of reagents for highly sensitive detection of anti-HIV antibodies in whole blood."
Dipyridamole inhibits cobalt chloride-induced osteopontin expression in NRK52E cells,"Tso-Hsiao Chen, Chia-Fang Chang, Shu-Chuan Yu, Jiueng-Chueng Wang, Horng-Mo Lee, ","European Journal of Pharmacology, Volume 613, Issues 1每3, 24 June 2009, Pages 10-18, ","Osteopontin plays a pivotal role in the progression of interstitial fibrosis in renal ischemia. In the present study, rat renal tubular NRK52E cells treated with hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride (CoCl2) increased osteopontin production, and are associated with increased phosphorylation of Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK). Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with l-N-acetylcysteine (an antioxidant) inhibited CoCl2-stimulated osteopontin protein expression and p38MAPK phosphorylation, but not Akt/PKB phosphorylation. Pretreatment of cells with anti-inflammatory agents celecoxib, tanshinone IIA, and dipyridamole inhibited CoCl2-induced osteopontin production paralleled by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction. Pretreatment of cells with tin protoporphyrin (a HO-1 inhibitor) or hemoglobin (a carbon monoxide scavenging agent) reversed dipyridamole inhibition of osteopontin expression. Moreover, transfection of HO-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced dipyridamole-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) phosphorylation. Conversely, MKP-1 knockdown reversed dipyridamole inhibition of osteopontin expression. Taken together, these data suggest that dipyridamole may inhibit CoCl2-induced osteopontin expression through HO-1 induction. Increased HO-1 may catalyze the conversion of heme into carbon monoxide, in turn carbon monoxide activates MKP-1. MKP-1 activation inhibits the p38MAPK signaling pathway that mediates CoCl2-induced osteopontin production."
Delayed deficits in behavior after transection of the olfactory tracts in hamsters,"David M. Marques, Robert J. O'Connell, Nicholas Benimoff, Foteos Macrides, ","Physiology & Behavior, Volume 28, Issue 2, February 1982, Pages 353-365, ","This study compared the effects of transection of the lateral olfactory tracts (LOT) and the accessory olfactory tracts (AOT) in male hamsters on nest building, food piling, and sexual behavior. Autoradiographic tracing of amino acids injected into the olfactory bulbs allowed accurate determination of the location and extent of the transections. Animals with complete bilateral transections of the projections to the amygdaloid targets of the accessory olfactory bulbs and to the main olfactory targets posterior to the olfactory tubercle showed no sexual behavior postoperatively; they did not exhibit extensive genital investigation and did not mount females. In contrast, most of the animals with partial sparing of accessory olfactory bulb efferents to the amygdala did exhibit investigatory and copulatory behaviors postoperatively, although half of the animals with this partial sparing developed delayed deficits in these sexual behaviors. Almost all animals without detectable main olfactory bulb efferents to posterior targets showed delayed deficits in nest building and food piling. This was true whether or not there was partial sparing of accessory olfactory bulb efferents to the amygdala. The animals with LOT transections typically built nests and piled food during the first postoperative week, but stopped building nests and piling food by the fourth postoperative week. Cold stress enhanced these two behaviors in control animals but did not obviate the deficits in experimental animals. Caudally placed transections, which spared a larger portion of the main olfactory projections than rostally placed transections, did not spare more behavior. In fact, the caudally placed transections produced shorter delays in the appearance of deficits in nest building and food piling. These results indicate that the accessory olfactory bulb efferents to the amygdala are more important for sexual behavior than for nest building and food piling in male hamsters. Nest building and food piling are not directly dependent on normal ongoing or sensory evoked activity in the main or accessory olfactory bulb efferents which project through the LOT and AOT. The deficits in nest building and food piling may represent a deterioration in the ability of the animals to organize their living space. The observed delays in the appearance of deficits in behavior may also reflect slow degenerative processes or humoral changes associated with loss of input from the main olfactory bulbs to posterior olfactory target areas, and possibly with interruptions of projections to targets of the accessory olfactory system."

We provide recommendations for guideline panels to promote greater transparency and rigor. We suggest focusing on resource allocation issues for only a limited number of recommendations and provide criteria for selecting those in which economic considerations are likely to influence the direction or strength of the recommendation. Panels should involve a health economist to assist with the systematic review and critical interpretation of relevant economic analyses. They should carefully define the intended audience and may consider issuing alternative recommendations when available resources vary widely across target clinical settings. Targeting a limited number of recommendations for the consideration of resource allocation issues, and ensuring methodologically high-quality review, will best serve guideline panels, and the health-care providers and patients they hope to assist."

Further, we leverage the social group practice to automate the privacy setting process for users who add new contacts or upload new data items. We evaluate our approach using real-world data collected through a user study. The study also includes an analysis of the properties that are most critical for privacy related decisions."
Rho-Kinase Inhibition Suppresses Potassium Chloride-Induced Bladder Hyperactivity in a Rat Model,"Mahadevan Rajasekaran, Neal Mehta, Angelo Baquir, Steven Kuntz, ","Urology, Volume 69, Issue 4, April 2007, Pages 791-794, ","The molecular mechanisms by which potassium induces urinary bladder hyperactivity are not clear. In the present study, we tested our hypothesis that potassium chloride (KCl)-induced bladder hyperactivity might be mediated through a calcium-sensitizing RhoA-Rho-kinase pathway in an in vivo animal model using urodynamic parameters.Two groups of adult male rats (n = 8) were anesthetized, their bladder exteriorized, and a saline-filled Intracath fixed into the bladder dome. This Intracath was connected to a pressure transducer and an infusion pump. Continuous filling cystometrograms were performed by infusing warm saline (0.04 mL/min) to obtain baseline data on each rat. The number of contractions per unit time (intercontractile intervals in seconds), pressure threshold, and peak pressure during micturition were recorded. To create bladder hyperactivity, protamine sulfate (30 mg/mL) followed by KCl (500 mM) was infused intravesically, and a continuous filling cystometrogram was again recorded. Y-27632, a specific RhoA-Rho-kinase inhibitor, was administered either intra-arterially (group 1) or intravesically (group 2) to each rat, and an additional continuous filling cystometrogram was recorded with KCl (500 mM) to observe the effects of Rho-kinase inhibition on bladder contractility.Intravesical KCl infusion after protamine exposure resulted in significantly greater contractions and decreased the intercontractile interval (P <0.05). Y-27632 administration attenuated the effect of KCl on the contractions and intercontractile interval and decreased the mean pressure threshold.Suppression of KCl-induced bladder contractility by the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 confirmed the involvement of this novel calcium-sensitizing RhoA-Rho-kinase pathway in mediating these smooth muscle contractions."
Chapter 8 Quantitation of Protein,"James E. Noble, Marc J. A.

Spectrophotometric protein quantitation assays are methods that use UV and visible spectroscopy to rapidly determine the concentration of protein, relative to a standard, or using an assigned extinction coefficient. Methods are described to provide information on how to analyze protein concentration using UV protein spectroscopy measurements, traditional dye-based absorbance measurements; BCA, Lowry, and Bradford assays and the fluorescent dye-based assays; amine derivatization and detergent partition assays. The observation that no single assay dominates the market is due to specific limitations of certain methods that investigators need to consider before selecting the most appropriate assay for their sample. Many of the dye-based assays have unique chemical mechanisms that are prone to interference from chemicals prevalent in many biological buffer preparations. A discussion of which assays are prone to interference and the selection of alternative methods is included."

Effect of water in ambient air on hysteresis in pentacene field-effect transistors containing gate dielectrics coated with polymers with different functional groups,"Se Hyun Kim, Hoichang Yang, Sang Yoon Yang, Kipyo Hong, Chan Eon Park, ","Organic Electronics, Volume 9, Issue 5, October 2008, Pages 673-677, ","We investigated the effect of water in ambient air on the hysteresis phenomena of pentacene field-effect transistors with polymer/SiO2 gate dielectrics. The polarity of the polymer surface was controlled by using three different polymers: poly(styrene), poly(4-hydroxy styrene), and poly(4-vinyl pyridine). Water diffusion into the interface between the pentacene and the gate dielectric was driven by the polarity of the polymer surface, resulting in considerable hysteresis and degradation of device performances. The observed hysteresis behaviors can be explained in terms of donor- and acceptor-like trap formation by water molecules that have diffused between the pentacene and the gate dielectric. The different effects of these traps on hysteresis depending on the functional groups at the polymer surface were also investigated."
Damage detection of beams using operational deflection shapes,"P. Frank Pai, Leyland G. Young, ","International Journal of Solids and Structures, Volume 38, Issue 18, May 2001, Pages 3161-3192, ","This work is an in-depth study of a boundary effect detection (BED) method for pinpointing locations of small damages in beams using operational deflection shapes (ODSs) measured by a scanning laser vibrometer. The BED method requires no model or historical data for locating structural damage. It works by decomposing a measured ODS into central and boundary-layer solutions using a sliding-window least-squares curve-fitting technique. For high-order ODSs of an intact beam, boundary-layer solutions are non-zero only at structural boundaries. For a damaged beam, its boundary-layer solutions are non-zero at the original boundaries and damage locations because damage introduces new boundaries. At a damage location, the boundary-layer solution of slope changes sign, and the boundary-layer solution of displacement peaks up or dimples down. The theoretical background is shown in detail. Noise and different types of damage are simulated to show how they affect damage locating curves. Experiments are performed on several different beams with different types of damage, including surface slots, edge slots, surface holes, internal holes, and fatigue cracks. Experimental results show that this damage detection method is sensitive and reliable for locating small damages in beams."
Isolated aromatic patches as a rule to select metallofullerene multiple adducts with high chemical stabilities,"Xuejiao Gao, Bo-Zhen Chen, Xingfa Gao, ","Carbon, Volume 96, January 2016, Pages 980-986, ","Metallofullerene multiple adducts (MMAs) have properties inherited from fullerene cores and new properties from exohedral chemical groups. However, the huge structural varieties of MMAs hinder their separation, purification and characterization. Here, we report that only subsets with large first excitation energies (FEEs) are chemically stable and likely to survive experimentally. On the basis of quantum confinement effect, we propose and verify a simple rule of thumb to quickly predict whether MMAs have large FEEs: only those whose sp2-carbons form aromatic patches isolated by sp3-carbons have large FEEs. It can serve as a tool for rapid screening of MMAs with high chemical stabilities. The rule involves the concept of forming anionic aromatic patches containing metals, which further provides an explicit physical picture on the metal-cage interaction within metallofullerenes. The results present here will not only benefit the future study of MMAs but also provide insights into the fundamental chemistry of metallofullerenes."

The effects of amygdala and cortical inactivation on taste neophobia,"Jian-You Lin, Joe Arthurs, Steve Reilly, ","Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, Volume 155, November 2018, Pages 322-329, ","The current study examined the effects of transient inactivation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA; Experiment 1) and gustatory cortex (GC; Experiment 2) on the expression of taste neophobia and its recovery. We found that inactivation (induced by infusions of baclofen/muscimol) of each structure before exposure to a novel saccharin (0.5%) solution elevated intake on Trial 1 (i.e., taste neophobia was attenuated) and, surprisingly, decreased intake on Trial 2. It seems unlikely that this intake reduction on Trial 2 can be attributed to taste aversion learning caused by drug infusions because in the subsequent experiments with the same set of the implanted animals, the rats did not decrease intake when baclofen/muscimol was infused after taste presentation on Trial 1. The latter result suggests that BLA or GC inactivation that attenuates taste neophobia may also impair memory consolidation of a safe taste experience."
"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers in soil from three typical industrial areas in Beijing, China","Yongfei Zhang, Shan Fu, Xinchun Liu, Zheng Li, Yuan Dong, ","Journal of Environmental Sciences, Volume 25, Issue 12, December 2013, Pages 2443-2450, ","Areas containing industrial facilities belonging to three different typical industries that may cause pollution by polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in Beijing, China were investigated. Specifically, the areas contained a solid waste incineration plant, a chemical factory, and a heat and power plant. Investigation of the pollution status of PBDEs in the surface soil from areas around these industries revealed the highest concentration of 42 PBDE congeners (118 ng/g, dry mass) at the solid waste incineration plant. In the other two plants, the highest concentrations were both 26 ng/g (dry mass). Among the PBDE homologues, the PBDE contamination at all sites showed similar congener compositions, with BDE 209 being the dominant congener. Our findings established the first contamination status of three typical industrial areas in Beijing. Furthermore, the total concentrations of 42 PBDE congeners tended to decrease as the distance from the investigated plants increased. Overall, these plants were identified as potential pollution sources of PBDEs in Beijing. Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the major PBDE source in Beijing may be associated with the technical deca-BDE and penta-BDE mixture. Based on the data obtained in this preliminary investigation, further study of the potential of these sources to emit PBDEs in Beijing is warranted."

Using a multistep column chromatographic procedure, monomeric Fab and Fab fusion proteins containing HIV-derived peptide were purified to high degree, free of aggregates. The yield of various proteins on the laboratory scale (1每2 l of shake flask culture) was in the range of tens of milligram. Purified anti-human RBC Fab fusion proteins containing sequences derived from HIV-1 gp41 and HIV-2 gp36 were highly specific for detection of antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively.

In this problem, many independent processors, which can produce different types of products, coordinate with a resource manager (or third-party logistic), who provides different types of vehicles to deliver products to the customers. The problem is decomposed into two parts: production planning for individual processors and vehicle scheduling for the resource manager. A total of 1200 instances are randomly generated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed distributed algorithm. Results of computational experiments verify that the proposed distributed algorithm has good solution quality and calculation efficiency compared with the integrated approach, i.e., CPLEX, hybrid Benders Decomposition, and Lagrangian Relaxation.

Invariant features of spatial inequality in consumption: The case of India,"Arnab Chatterjee, Anindya S. Chakrabarti, Asim Ghosh, Anirban Chakraborti, Tushar K. Nandi, ","Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, Volume 442, 15 January 2016, Pages 169-181, ","We study the distributional features and inequality of consumption expenditure across India, for different states, castes, religion and urban每rural divide. We find that even though the aggregate measures of inequality are fairly diversified across states, the consumption distributions show near identical statistics, once properly normalized. This feature is seen to be robust with respect to variations in sociological and economic factors. We also show that state-wise inequality seems to be positively correlated with growth which is in accord with the traditional idea of Kuznets＊ curve. We present a brief model to account for the invariance found empirically and show that better but riskier technology draws can create a positive correlation between inequality and growth."
Clinical translation of biomedical materials and the key factors towards product registration,"Yuan Yuan, Dan Lin, Fangping Chen, Changsheng Liu, ","Journal of Orthopaedic Translation, Volume 2, Issue 2, April 2014, Pages 49-55, ","Biomedical materials have been developed for facilitating tissue regeneration and healing enhancement. Although research on biomedical materials has made great progress in material innovation and preclinical testing, the bottleneck is their translation from research and development to clinical applications; that is, the current rate of product registration and industrialization is low, which directly affects their clinical applications. In this paper, we introduce the basic features of biomedical materials towards the making of medical products and the experiences of our group in research and clinical translation of biomaterials for bone-tissue regeneration in the last few years. Based on our experience, we propose that the translational medicine platform (TMP) is an effective route to facilitate the progress of biomedical materials from bench to bedside. Moreover, from the viewpoints of scientific technology and management, the functions of TMP were also addressed. Relationships among TMP, research institution, enterprise, and government were also explored from the viewpoints of technological innovation, chemical engineering integration, fund raising, and management. This paper provides a theoretical and practical reference for clinical translation of biomedical materials."
Human cone saturation as a function of ambient intensity: A test of models of shifts in the dynamic range,"Donald C. Hood, Thomas Ilves, Edward Maurer, Brian Wandell, Eugene Buckingham, ","Vision Research, Volume 18, Issue 8, 1978, Pages 983-993, ","Cone saturation refers to the fact that an intensity (the saturating intensity) of a flash can be found such that the cone system cannot detect increments upon this flash no matter how intense these increments are made. By making assumptions which relate both the psychophysically obtained threshold and saturating intensities of the flash to a supposed physiological response, models describing the shifts in the dynamic range can be tested. The present study examines the effects on threshold and saturation produced by various steady adapting intensities. The data are fit by a model incorporating changes in both the semisaturation constant of the system and the maximum response elicited by a flash."

Inhibition of B7-H3 reverses oxaliplatin resistance in human colorectal cancer cells,"Pengfei Zhang, Zhen Chen, Kuan Ning, Jian Jin, Xiaofeng Han, ","Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Volume 490, Issue 3, 26 August 2017, Pages 1132-1138, ","B7-H3, an immunoregulatory protein, has been found highly expressed in several cancer types, and involved in cancer cell migration and invasion. Here, we investigated the role of B7-H3 in oxaliplatin resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Transient silencing of B7-H3 enhanced oxaliplatin sensitivity by increasing oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage. The overexpression of B7-H3 increased oxaliplatin resistance reducing the formation of phosphorylated histone H2AX (污H2AX) loci. The silencing of X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1), upregulated in B7-H3 overexpressing cells, induced an increase in cell death following oxaliplatin treatment. Finally, the upregulation of XRCC1 expression induced by B7-H3 involved PI3K-AKT pathway. In conclusion, B7-H3 promotes the oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells upregulating the expression of XRCC1 via PI3K-AKT pathway."
A higher-order sandwich plate theory accounting for 3-D stresses,"P. Frank Pai, Anthony N. Palazotto, ","International Journal of Solids and Structures, Volume 38, Issues 30每31, July 2001, Pages 5045-5062, ","In this paper we extend a layerwise higher-order shear-deformation theory to model a sandwich plate impacting with an elastic foundation at a low velocity. A new concept of sublaminates is introduced, and the new sandwich plate theory satisfies the continuity conditions of interlaminar shear and normal stresses, accommodates the normal and shear stresses on the bonding surfaces, and accounts for non-uniform distributions of transverse shear stresses in each layer. Moreover, the use of sublaminates enables the modeling of shear warpings that change with the spatial location, vibration frequency, and loading and boundary conditions. A finite-element model based on this sandwich plate theory is derived for performing direct transient analyses to predict the initiation and location of critical matrix crack and the threshold of impact damage. Moreover, analytical shear warping functions, shear coupling functions, and normal strain functions due to in-plane stretching, bending, transverse shearing, and surface loading are presented."
Two-dimensional sublamination theory for analysis of functionally graded plates,"P. Frank Pai, Anthony N. Palazotto, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, Volume 308, Issues 1每2, 20 November 2007, Pages 164-189, ","Presented is a two-dimensional sublamination theory for analysis of plates made of functionally graded materials. The sublamination plate theory extends a layer-wise higher-order shear-deformation theory for laminated plates by considering material properties being continuous functions of the thickness coordinate and using a new concept of sublamination to increase the degrees of freedom. The theory accommodates free shear stress conditions on the bonding surfaces, accounts for non-uniform deformation-dependent distributions of transverse shear stresses through the thickness, can be used for evaluating boundary restraint effects, and can be used for analyzing thin and thick plates with any boundary conditions. A sublamination plate element based on this theory is developed and validated for static and dynamic analysis. The degrees of freedom of the element is adaptable. For an element away from boundaries, it's degrees of freedom can be reduced at the elemental level without loss of accuracy. Analytical shear warping functions are presented. Moreover, modal analysis of functionally graded plates with different boundary conditions is performed to show the capability and accuracy of the theory."
Urban form breeds neighborhood vibrancy: A case study using a GPS-based activity survey in suburban Beijing,"Jiayu Wu, Na Ta, Yan Song, Jian Lin, Yanwei Chai, ","Cities, Volume 74, April 2018, Pages 100-108, ","In this paper, we present a formal analysis of the neighborhood vibrancy created by urban form. We use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to develop quantitative measures of urban form and define neighborhood vibrancy based on a GPS-based activity survey in suburban Beijing. An Urban Form index was adopted to determine that our measures of urban form capture meaningful differences in the characteristics of urban neighborhoods 每 differences that may have direct impacts on neighborhood vibrancy. Specifically, high density and mixed land use are strongly positively correlated with neighborhood vibrancy, whereas developed external traffic systems are negative. However, a thorough inter-circulation system and convenient accessibility do not always boost neighborhood vibrancy. These factors lose efficacy when gated neighborhoods are selected and surrounding facilities are distributed far away. Our study argues that urban planners, using their professional judgment, can contribute to urban vitality at the neighborhood scale."
Calpain II in two in vivo models of sugar cataract,"Mitsuyoshi Azuma, Thomas R. Shearer, Takahiro Matsumoto, Larry L. David, Takashi Murach, ","Experimental Eye Research, Volume 51, Issue 4, October 1990, Pages 393-401, ","Cataracts were produced in rat lenses by either feeding a diet containing 50% galactose or by inducing diabetic condition by intravenous injection of streptozotocin. Proteolysis of crystallins, protease activity of calpain II enzyme (EC 3.4.22.17), and presence of calpain molecule (antigen) were determined at four cataract stages〞I, cortical vacuoles, II, vacuoles plus hazy cortex, III, nuclear cataract, and IV, mature cataracts. Calpain activity was normal or moderately elevated at early stages of galactose and diabetic cataracts. Later stages III and IV showed proteolysis of lens crystallins, increased proportion of insoluble proteins, loss of calpain enzyme activity and calpain molecule from the soluble fraction, and reduced amounts of calpain associated with insoluble pellet. In galactose cataract, the largest increase in lens calcium were found when proteolysis was present. These results provide evidence for calpain-induced proteolysis of lens crystallins in two in vivo models of sugar cataracts in rodents."
Adaptive tracking control for a class of switched uncertain nonlinear systems under a new state-dependent switching law,"Ding Zhai, An-Yang Lu, Dan Ye, Qing-Ling Zhang, ","Nonlinear Analysis: Hybrid Systems, Volume 24, May 2017, Pages 227-243, ","This paper deals with the problem of adaptive fuzzy tracking control for a class of switched uncertain nonlinear systems. Fuzzy logic systems are utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, and the adaptive backstepping and dynamic surface control techniques are adopted. First, a new state-dependent switching method is proposed. By introducing convex combination technique and designing a state-dependent switching law, only the solvability of the adaptive tracking control problem for a convex combination of the subsystems is necessary. Second, a new common Lyapunov function with switched adaptive parameters is constructed to reduce the conservatism. Third, to avoid Zeno behavior, a modified state-dependent switching law with dwell time is proposed. It is shown that under the proposed control and switching laws, all the signals of the closed-loop system are bounded and all the state tracking errors can converge to a priori accuracy, even if some subsystems are uncontrollable. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through two simulation examples."
Detection and discrimination of volatile organic compounds using a single multi-resonance mode piezotransduced silicon bulk acoustic wave resonator (PSBAR) as virtual sensor array,"Yuan Zhao, Qingrui Yang, Ye Chang, Hemi Qu, Xuexin Duan, ","Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, Volume 254, January 2018, Pages 1191-1199, ","This paper describes the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using an e-nose system based on a virtual sensor array (VSA). The VSA was realized by seven different resonant modes of a single piezotransduced silicon bulk acoustic wave resonator (PSBAR) which can greatly reduce the complexity of a conventional e-nose system. The PSBAR was designed and fabricated using standard CMOS compatible process. The resonant modes of the PSBAR and its capability of VOCs discrimination were theoretically explored through finite element analysis. The discrimination effect was enhanced by the non-uniform adsorption of gas molecules on the top, side and bottom regions of the resonator. Score plots and radar fingerprints obtained respectively from principal component analysis (PCA) and fitted coefficient of adsorption isotherms for each VOC compose sufficient information to successfully discriminate different VOCs. The proposed novel VSA shows great potential as a compact and promising e-nose system."
The modified surface properties and fatigue life of Incoloy A286 face-milled at different cutting parameters,"Guoliang Liu, Chuanzhen Huang, Hongtao Zhu, Zhanqiang Liu, Chengwu Li, ","Materials Science and Engineering: A, Volume 704, 17 September 2017, Pages 1-9, ","Incoloy A286 alloy is an iron-base superalloy that widely used in gas turbine jet engines and other similar applications, and the high reliability demand of such applications drew significant attention to the machining induced surface integrity and fatigue life. In this work, the Incoloy A286 was face-milled at different cutting parameters, and the surface properties and fatigue life of the modified surface were measured and analysed. It is found that the cutting parameters can modify the surface integrity and mechanical properties significantly, and further obviously influence the fatigue life of the workpiece. The modified fatigue life under different cutting parameters was mainly determined by the roughness and mechanical properties, including the yield strength and fracture toughness, rather than the residual stresses, because of the severe stress relaxation. The surface yield strength had strong positive correlation with the work hardening, while the surface fracture toughness (KJC) was related to the work hardening formation mechanism and grain refinement. The optimal cutting parameters were recommended according to the surface integrity and fatigue life measurement results at last."

Results vary in the number of factors retained. The present study used a formal diagnostic instrument to examine how symptoms of mania in young people are expressed, depending on age of symptom onset and current age.Trained clinicians completed the Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS) Mania Rating Scale (MRS) with parents of 163 children with child-onset of symptoms (before age 12), 94 adolescents with child-onset of symptoms, and 90 adolescents with adolescent-onset of symptoms (after age 12). Factor analysis of symptom ratings during the most severe lifetime manic episode was performed for each age group.Symptom factor structures were established for each age group. Two factors were evident for children with child-onset of symptoms (※activated/pleasure seeking§ and ※labile/disorganized§), one factor was present for adolescents with child-onset of symptoms (※activated/pleasure seeking/disorganized§) and two factors were evident for adolescents with adolescent-onset of symptoms (※activated/pleasure seeking§ and ※disorganized/psychotic§). The factor structures for children with child-onset and adolescents with adolescent-onset of symptoms were highly similar, with the latter factor structure including psychotic symptoms.Limitations include reliance on retrospective parent report and potential issues with generalizability.Findings suggest mania symptomatology is largely similar when examined by both age of onset and current age, with some notable differences. Specifically, psychotic symptoms begin emerging as a distinct factor in adolescents with adolescent-onset of symptoms."
Gas hydrates (clathrates) causing pore-water freshening and oxygen isotope fractionation in deep-water sedimentary sections of terrigenous continental margins,"Reinhard Hesse, William E. Harrison, ","Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Volume 55, Issue 3, November 1981, Pages 453-462, ","The occurrence of gas hydrates in deep-water sections of the continental margins predicted from anomalous acoustic reflectors on seismic profiles has been confirmed by recent deep-sea drilling results. On the Pacific continental slope off Guatemala gas hydrates were brought up for the first time from two holes (497, 498A) drilled during Leg 67 of the DSDP in water depths of 2360 and 5500 m, respectively. The hydrates occur in organic matter-rich Pleistocene to Miocene terrigenous sediments. In the hydrate-bearing zone a marked decrease in interstitial water chlorinities was observed starting at about 10每20 m subbottom depth. Pore waters at the bottom of the holes (near 400 m subbottom) have as little as half the chlorinity of seawater (i.e. 9㏑). Similar, but less pronounced, trends were observed during previous legs of the DSDP in other hydrate-prone segments of the continental margins where recharge of fresh water from the continent can be excluded (e.g. Leg 11). The crystallization of hydrates, like ice, excludes salt ions from the crystal structure. During burial the dissolved salts are separated from the solids. Subsidence results in a downward motion of the solids (including hydrates) relative to the pore fluids. Thawing of hydrates during recovery releases fresh water which is remixed with the pore fluid not involved in hydrate formation. The volume of the latter decreases downhole thus causing downward decreasing salinity (chlorinity). Hydrate formation is responsible for oxygen isotope fractionation with18O-enrichment in the hydrate explaining increasingly more positive 汛18O values in the pore fluids recovered (after hydrate dissociation) with depth."

Avoiding the risk of responsibility by seeking uncertainty: Responsibility aversion and preference for indirect agency when choosing for others,"James M. Leonhardt, L. Robin Keller, Cornelia Pechmann, ","Journal of Consumer Psychology, Volume 21, Issue 4, October 2011, Pages 405-413, ","Uncertainty-seeking behavior is currently understood as the result of loss aversion which motivates a preference for the possibility to avoid or lessen an otherwise sure loss. However, when choosing among negative options on behalf of others, we offer responsibility aversion as another possible motive for uncertainty-seeking behavior. Within our conceptual model, responsibility aversion is defined as the preference to minimize one's causal role in outcome generation. Compared to certain options, uncertain options lessen the decision maker's causal role in outcome generation because the outcomes are partially determined by chance. The presence of chance increases indirect agency on behalf of the decision maker and lessens his or her perceived risk of responsibility. The results of five studies support a responsibility aversion motivation behind uncertainty-seeking behavior."

Each examiner performed: 1) standard ophthalmoscopy on 72 to 150 consecutive infants at his respective institution and 2) telemedical diagnosis on 125 consecutive deidentified retinal image sets from infants from an at-risk population. Time for ophthalmoscopic diagnosis was measured in 2 ways: 1) time spent by the examiner at the infant's bedside and 2) mean total time commitment per infant. Time for telemedicine diagnosis was recorded by computer time stamps in the web-based system. For each examiner, nonparametric statistical analysis (Mann每Whitney U test) was used to compare the distribution of times for examination by ophthalmoscopy vs telemedicine.Mean (㊣ standard deviation [SD]) times for ophthalmoscopic diagnosis ranged from 4.17 (㊣ 1.34) minutes to 6.63 (㊣ 2.28) minutes per infant. Mean (㊣ SD) times for telemedicine diagnosis ranged from 1.02 (㊣ 0.27) minutes to 1.75 (㊣ 0.80) minutes per infant. Telemedicine was significantly faster than ophthalmoscopy (P < .0001).

The influences of the structural isomers of PDA on the PyPBI copolymerization and properties were elucidated by characterizing the resulting copolymers. The solubility of PDA monomers in PPA and the overall monomer concentration in the polymerization were found to be the deciding factors. The higher molecular weight PyPBI were obtained for higher para content copolymers due to the low solubility of para PDA in PPA. The introduction of para structure had enhanced the conjugation along the polymer chain. NMR study showed that the reactivity ratio of para PDA was not identical for all the three sets of PyPBI copolymers, it varied upon the positions of the dicarboxylic acids in the pyridine ring of meta PDAs (structural isomeric effect) with which 2,5 PDA is forming the copolymer.

Self-paced stacked denoising autoencoders based on differential evolution for change detection,"Hao Li, Maoguo Gong, Congcong Wang, Qiguang Miao, ","Applied Soft Computing, Volume 71, October 2018, Pages 698-714, ","Due to the existence of speckle noise in synthetic aperture radar images, the traditional unsupervised change detection methods do not need any prior information whereas cannot preserve details well. In order to improve change detection performance, change detection methods exploiting supervised classifier have been investigated recently. These methods require reliable labeled samples to train a robust classifier and these samples are always unavailable for image change detection. In this paper, we put forward a novel self-paced stacked denoising autoencoders model to address this issue. In the proposed model, stacked denoising autoencoders are adopted as the supervised classifier, and then self-paced learning is employed to improve it. During iterations, each training sample is associated with a weight and stacked denoising autoencoders are implemented to learn these weighted samples. Furthermore, in the original self-paced learning, it is difficult to determine the pace parameter for acquiring the desired classification performance. Therefore differential evolution is employed to acquire an appropriate pace parameter sequence. Experiments on five real synthetic aperture radar image datasets demonstrate the feasibility and availability of the proposed model. Compared with several other change detection methods, the proposed model is more robust to the speckle noise and can achieve better performance on high resolution synthetic aperture radar images."
Flow and transport in fractured tuff at Yucca Mountain: numerical experiments on fast preferential flow mechanisms,"Robert G. McLaren, Peter A. Forsyth, Edward A. Sudicky, Joel E. VanderKwaak, John H.

A dual continuum model (DCM) for simulating transient flow and transport at Yucca Mountain is developed. In order to ensure properly converged flow solutions, which are used in the transport simulation, a new flow solution convergence criteria is derived. An extensive series of simulation studies is presented which indicates that rapid movement of solute through the fractures will not occur unless there are intense episodic infiltration events. Movement of solute in the environs of the repository is enhanced if the properties of the tuff layer at the repository horizon are modified from current best-estimate values. Due to a large advective每dispersive coupling between the matrix and fractures, the matrix acts as a major buffer which inhibits rapid transport along the fractures. Consequently, fast movement of solutes through the fractures to the repository depth can only be explained if the matrix每fracture coupling term is significantly reduced from a value that would be calculated on the basis of data currently available."

A key component of the approach involved ＆mapping the problem＊. Using a systems-based approach, landholders developed four system diagrams broadly describing the ecology of woody weed re-occurrence, control options, property economics and management constraints with diagrams identifying how different factors related to, or influenced, each other. Agency personnel also constructed a system diagram describing institutional and regulatory constraints, and their interactions. Later, all these system diagrams formed the basis for an adaptive management model with capabilities for developing and quantitatively evaluating alternative management strategies relating to woody weeds. This model is called the Woody Weed Planner.The Woody Weed Planner contains mathematical relationships developed through field experimentation over the last 25每50 years covering the ecology of woody weeds, control options and control economics. These relationships enable the user to generate mathematical responses as a result of changing model parameters. A key component of the model is the ability to simulate the effects of alternative management responses given different rainfall scenarios. To enable this to occur, the Planner allows the user to replay historical rainfall patterns and ask the question ※what impact will these have on woody weeds, stocking rates and economic performance on my property?§"

HHT-based nonlinear signal processing method for parametric and non-parametric identification of dynamical systems,"P. Frank Pai, Anthony N. Palazotto, ","International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, Volume 50, Issue 12, December 2008, Pages 1619-1635, ","This paper presents a time每frequency signal processing method based on Hilbert每Huang transform (HHT) and a sliding-window fitting (SWF) technique for parametric and non-parametric identification of nonlinear dynamical systems. The SWF method is developed to reveal the limitations of conventional signal processing methods and to perform further decomposition of signals. Similar to the short-time Fourier transform and wavelet transform, the SWF uses windowed regular harmonics and function orthogonality to extract time-localized regular and/or distorted harmonics. On the other hand, HHT uses the apparent time scales revealed by the signal's local maxima and minima to sequentially sift components of different time scales, starting from high- to low-frequency ones. Because HHT does not use pre-determined basis functions and function orthogonality for component extraction, it provides more accurate time-varying amplitudes and frequencies of extracted components for accurate estimation of system characteristics and nonlinearities. Methods are developed to reduce the end effect caused by Gibbs＊ phenomenon and other mathematical and numerical problems of HHT analysis. For parametric identification of a nonlinear one-degree-of-freedom system, the method processes one free damped transient response and one steady-state response and uses amplitude-dependent dynamic characteristics derived from perturbation analysis to determine the type and order of nonlinearity and system parameters. For non-parametric identification, the method uses the maximum displacement states to determine the displacement每stiffness curve and the maximum velocity states to determine the velocity-damping curve. Moreover, the SWF method and a synchronous detection method are used for further decomposition of components extracted by HHT to improve the accuracy of parametric and non-parametric estimations. Numerical simulations of several nonlinear systems show that the proposed method can provide accurate parametric and non-parametric identifications of different nonlinear dynamical systems."

It was found that when exposed to 5% sodium sulfate solution, both FA and SF can improve concrete＊s resistance to sulfate attack and in comparison SF performed better than FA. Concrete deterioration was attributed to the interaction between freezing-thawing and sulfate attack. As for concrete without any admixture, its resistance against combined freezing-thawing and sulfate attack increased up to 125 freezing-thawing cycles and then decreased. The replacement level of 25% FA and 5每8% SF both by weight led to significant improvements in the resistance of concrete against combined freezing-thawing and sulfate attack. 10% sodium sulfate solutions more obviously improved freezing-thawing resistance of concrete with 25% by weight FA replacing OPC than 5% sodium sulfate solutions, while 5% and 10% sodium sulfate solution had the similar improvements in freezing-thawing resistance of concrete with 8% by weight SF replacing OPC."
Detection and identification of nonlinearities by amplitude and frequency modulation analysis,"P. Frank Pai, Anthony N. Palazotto, ","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, Volume 22, Issue 5, July 2008, Pages 1107-1132, ","This paper presents an amplitude and frequency modulation method (AFMM) for extracting characteristics of nonlinear systems and intermittent transient responses by processing stationary/transient responses using the empirical mode decomposition, Hilbert每Huang transform (HHT), and nonlinear dynamic characteristics derived from perturbation analysis. A sliding-window fitting (SWF) method is derived and used to show the physical implications of the proposed method and other methods for data processing and transformation. Similar to the wavelet transform, the SWF uses windowed regular harmonics and function orthogonality to extract time-localized regular and/or distorted harmonics, and then the amplitude and frequency modulations of the harmonics are used to identify system nonlinearities. On the other hand, the HHT uses the apparent time scales revealed by the signal's local maxima and minima and cubic splines of the extrema to sequentially sift components of different time scales, starting from high-frequency to low-frequency ones. Because HHT does not use predetermined basis functions and function orthogonality for component extraction, it provides more accurate instant amplitudes and frequencies of extracted components for accurate estimation of system characteristics and nonlinearities. Moreover, because the first component extracted by HHT contains all original discontinuities, its time-varying amplitude and frequency are excellent indicators for pinpointing times and locations of impulsive external loads. However, the discontinuity-induced Gibbs＊ phenomenon makes HHT analysis inaccurate around the two data ends. On the other hand, the SWF analysis is not affected by Gibbs＊ phenomenon, but it cannot extract accurate time-varying frequencies and amplitudes because of the use of predetermined basis functions, function orthogonality, and windowed curve fitting for component extraction. Numerical results show that the proposed AFMM can provide accurate estimation of softening and hardening effects, different orders of nonlinearity, linear and nonlinear system parameters, and time instants of intermittent transient responses."
The value of three-dimensional helical computed tomography for the retrograde flexible ureteronephroscopy in the treatment of lower pole calyx stones,"Yan Xu, Jian-Lin Lyu, ","Chronic Diseases and Translational Medicine, Volume 2, Issue 1, March 2016, Pages 42-47, ","The aim of our study was to determine if there is any advantage of three-dimensional helical computed tomography (3D-HCT) over intravenous urogram (IVU) for the retrograde flexible ureteronephroscopy in the treatment of lower pole calyx stones.From June 2012 to January 2014, a total of 52 cases of lower pole renal stones underwent retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) in our center. All patients underwent a preoperative IVU and three-dimensional helical computed tomography urography (3D-CTU) program to define the collecting system anatomy, manly concerning the following lower pole features; infundibu-lopelvic angle (IPA), infundibular length (IL), and infundibular width (IW). The examinations were performed in the same center of reference with a standardized method and with 3D-HCT Siemens Somaton Plus equipment. The measurements were performed by the same researcher, using a ruler and a square.Based on clinical threshold difference of the anatomic factors on an IVU image to compare the difference between an IVU image and a 3D-CT image of 52 patients, the IPA was <30∼ when measured on intravenous pyelography (IVP) for 21 patients. We found that with the IPA of <30∼ measured with IVP only 19% (4/21) were correctly classified in the same size category using 3D-HCT, whereas 81% (17/21) were upgraded to 40每50∼ on 3D-CT. This difference was significant between IVP and 3D-HCT.3D-HCT has advantages over IVU when analyzing the morphometric and the morphological features of kidney lower pole spatial anatomy for the retrograde flexible ureteronephroscopy in the treatment of lower pole calyx stones."

We aimed to characterise the effect of these geo-economic variations in patients enrolled in the Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (LUNG SAFE).LUNG SAFE was done during 4 consecutive weeks in winter, 2014, in a convenience sample of 459 intensive-care units in 50 countries across six continents. Inclusion criteria were admission to a participating intensive-care unit (including transfers) within the enrolment window and receipt of invasive or non-invasive ventilation. One of the trial's secondary aims was to characterise variations in the demographics, management, and outcome of patients with ARDS. We used the 2016 World Bank countries classification to define three major geo-economic groupings, namely European high-income countries (Europe-High), high-income countries in the rest of the world (rWORLD-High), and middle-income countries (Middle). We compared patient outcomes across these three groupings. LUNG SAFE is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02010073.Of the 2813 patients enrolled in LUNG SAFE who fulfilled ARDS criteria on day 1 or 2, 1521 (54%) were recruited from Europe-High, 746 (27%) from rWORLD-High, and 546 (19%) from Middle countries. We noted significant geographical variations in demographics, risk factors for ARDS, and comorbid diseases. The proportion of patients with severe ARDS or with ratios of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (FiO2) less than 150 was significantly lower in rWORLD-High countries than in the two other regions. Use of prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade was significantly more common in Europe-High countries than in the other two regions. Adjusted duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the intensive-care unit were significantly shorter in patients in rWORLD-High countries than in Europe-High or Middle countries. High gross national income per person was associated with increased survival in ARDS; hospital survival was significantly lower in Middle countries than in Europe-High or rWORLD-High countries.Important geo-economic differences exist in the severity, clinician recognition, and management of ARDS, and in patients' outcomes. Income per person and outcomes in ARDS are independently associated.European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, St Michael's Hospital, University of Milan-Bicocca."
Numerical modeling and simulation of a prestressed concrete containment vessel,"Jian-Ying Wu, Ding-Di Hao, Wen-Sheng Li, Xiao-Dan Ren, ","Annals of Nuclear Energy, Volume 121, November 2018, Pages 269-283, ","This work addresses the numerical modeling and simulation of prestressed concrete containment vessels (PCCVs) using the damaged-plasticity model for concrete and accounting for its interactions with the steel materials (i.e., the steel rebars, liner plate and prestressed tendons). Specifically, the 1:4-scale PCCV model tested by the Sandia National Lab (SNL) is considered. For concrete a novel fracture energy based method is employed to produce the data for the softening curve and damage evolution law such that mesh size independent numerical results can be guaranteed. To facilitate the finite element modeling, the interactions between steel and concrete are indirectly modeled by modifying appropriately the stress-strain relations of the steel materials as in Hsu and Mo (2010). The SNL PCCV model is then numerically modeling and symmetrically investigated. The effects of various strategies in modifying the steel stress-strain relations are discussed. It is found that, in addition to the prestressed tendons, the interactions between the liner plate/steel bars and concrete play non-negligible roles in correctly predicting the limit capacity and ultimate failure mode of the PCCV model. The numerical results obtained from the presented method, i.e., the limit capacity, failure mode, deformations and strains around crucial locations, etc., agree well with the experimental data, illustrating its capability in modeling the mechanical behavior of the PCCV like structures."

As endometrial tumor advances, it also elicits chronic inflammation characterized by increased cytokine secretion and immune cells infiltration. The present study was designed to engineer mixed micellar curcumin loaded formulation for investigating survivin down-regulation, its anti-cancer and cytokine modulatory potential against endometrial cancer Ishikawa cells. Flory每Huggins interaction parameter (聿pd) was applied to predict the compatibility between curcumin and surfactant mixture. The developed and characterized formulations were used to comparatively assess hemolysis, cellular uptake, cell-viability, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, rhodamine accumulation and bioavailability. In-vitro cytotoxicity in Vero cells demonstrated no deleterious effects on cell population. We saw better bioavailability, significant rhodamine accumulation, changes in protein expression and modulation in TNF-汐, IL-6 and IL-10 levels. In conclusion, developed formulation warrants exploring the therapeutic interventions for overcoming resistance development in endometrial cancer.Resistance development in endometrial cancer is due to survivin up-regulation and P-gp efflux of anti-cancer drugs. Unfortunately, curcumin and its formulation have been poorly investigated in endometrial cancer. Mixed micelles of curcumin fabricated using smart surfactants overcome the present challenges by down-regulating survivin levels, enhancing apoptosis and decreasing efflux of curcumin. A significant modulation in cytokine level with increased bioavailability helps explore curcumin micelles as a viable therapeutic option in endometrial cancer.Download high-res image (210KB)Download full-size image"

One hundred (22.6%) patients had one or more positive SLNs, and were analyzed to determine factors that predicted additional positive axillary nodes.Results: Of the 100 patients with a positive SLN, 40 patients (40%) had additional metastasis in non-SLNs. The only significant variables that predicted non-SLN metastasis were tumor lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.004), extranodal extension (P <0.001), and increasing size of the metastasis within the SLN (P = 0.011). In analyzing just those patients who had lymphovascular invasion, extranodal extension, and a SLN metastasis >2mm, 92% were found to have additional positive nodes.Conclusions: In patients with invasive breast cancer and a positive sentinel lymph node, lymphovascular invasion, extranodal extension, and increasing size of the metastasis all significantly increase the frequency of additional positive nodes."

Recent data demonstrates how: vitamin B precursors modulate intracellular trafficking of MR1 and impact on MAIT cell development; variation in the MAIT cell antigen receptor sequence impacts MR1-antigen recognition; and most notably, how MR1 can capture chemical identities distinct from riboflavin precursors, including drugs and drug-like molecules.

Reactive transport modeling of thorium in a cloud computing environment,"Xiang Huang, Guoliang Cao, Jie Liu, Henning Prommer, Chunmiao Zheng, ","Journal of Geochemical Exploration, Volume 144, Part A, September 2014, Pages 63-73, ","Despite the long standing interest in modeling the fate and environmental impacts of radionuclides, simulations addressing the fate and transport of rare earth elements (REEs) and thorium (Th) have received comparably little attention. This study presents an architecture that enables reactive transport modeling and parameter sensitivity analysis on cloud computing platforms. We adapted an existing groundwater modeling framework to perform some of the computationally most expensive steps within a cloud environment based on Microsoft Windows Azure. The cloud computing architecture was evaluated and validated through the development of a schematic, cross sectional model along a transect across a tailings impoundment at a REE mine tailings site in northwest China. The model framework employs a suite of flow, solute transport and reactive transport simulation tools, i.e., MODFLOW, MT3DMS, and PHT3D. On the basis of our model simulations, the collection-trench for the impoundment constructed above the ground surface appears to collect a substantial portion of the leachate fluxes, but the remainder will bypass the trench and migrate downstream. Those bypassed leachate fluxes will subsequently interact with downstream fluviolacustrine aquifers and eventually discharge into the Yellow River south of the study site under the idealized simulation environment. Further investigations of the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system and the impoundment dam, and other geochemical characteristics are needed to elucidate the fate and transport of thorium and improve the reliability of the numerical model. Although the discussion and analysis of this study is tailored to thorium reactive transport modeling of a REE tailings impoundment, such a framework can also be applied to deploy different types of scientific modeling applications on Azure Cloud.Download full-size image"
Fully-integrated modelling of surface and subsurface water flow and solute transport: Model overview and application,"Edward A. Sudicky, Joel E. Vanderkwaak, Jon P. Jones, Jon P. Keizer, George B. Matanga, ","Developments in Water Science, Volume 50, 2003, Pages 313-318, ","A physically-based, fully-integrated model has been recently developed that considers water and solute transport on the two-dimensional land surface and three-dimensional dual continua (i.e. porous mediummacropore) subsurface under variably-saturated conditions. The two-dimensional form of the nonlinear diffusion-wave equation, together with Manning's equation to compute overland flow velocities, are employed on the surface, while Richards' equation and Darcy's law are assumed to hold in the subsurface. Two- and three-dimensional forms of the advection-dispersion equation are used to describe solute transport on the surface and within the subsurface, respectively. Linkage between the various continua is through first-order, physically based flux relationships or through pressure head and concentration continuity assumptions. Full coupling of the flow regimes is achieved by solving and assembling one system of discrete algebraic equations such that surface water depths and subsurface pressure heads, as well as water fluxes between continua, are determined simultaneously. Likewise, one system of advective-dispersive transport equations is solved to obtain the solute concentrations in the surface and subsurface flow domains. Robust and efficient discretization and solution techniques are utilized to achieve a high degree of computational efficiency. The model is applied to the Laurel Creek watershed in Southern Ontario, which is about 75 km2 in area and includes both urban and rural land uses. Through past and ongoing field studies, the watershed is resonably well characterized and is being monitored on an ongoing basis. In addition to diverse land use and surface cover and more than 100m of topographic relief, the watershed is underlain by a complex interconnected sequence of sand and gravel aquifers used for water supply that are separated by discontinuous clayey aquitards."

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as selective electron diffraction (SED). The possible magnetic (Fe, Co, Ni) impurities in the BP material were analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Magnetization measurements were performed using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, Quantum Design PPMS-9T). The results indicate that the BP nanosheets sample has a weak ferromagnetic ordering with high magnetization 1.83 emu/g at room temperature. Analysis states the ferromagnetism is intrinsic to the BP samples, ruling out extrinsic ferromagnetism arising from magnetic metal impurities. The combination effects of magnetic moments resulting from defects or vacancies, the formation of edge states and the p orbital spin polarization of the oxygen and phosphorus atoms of the surface PO bonds contribute to the observed ferromagnetism in BP nanosheets sample. The conversion of ferromagnetism of 2D material BP at room temperature will be of great implication for spintronics application in the future."
Nonlinearity identification by time-domain-only signal processing,"P. Frank Pai, Bao-Anh Nguyen, Mannur J. Sundaresan, ","International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics, Volume 54, September 2013, Pages 85-98, ","A conjugate-pair decomposition (CPD) method is proposed for signal decomposition, dynamics characterization, and nonlinearity identification all in the time domain only. CPD uses the empirical mode decomposition method with signal conditioning techniques to decompose a compound signal into well separated intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and then uses a pair of sliding conjugate functions to accurately extract the time-varying frequency and amplitude of each IMF using only three neighboring data points for each time instant. Because the variations of frequencies and amplitudes of IMFs contain system characteristics, they can be used for dynamics characterization and nonlinearity identification of discrete and continuum systems. Several discrete and continuum systems' simulated and experimental responses are used to validate CPD's accuracy and capability for system and nonlinearity identification. Experimental nonlinear free vibration of a horizontally cantilevered steel beam subject to an initial tip displacement is analyzed using CPD, and direct numerical simulations using a fully nonlinear finite-element code are also performed and compared. Both experimental and numerical results show that the first-mode vibration contains a softening cubic nonlinearity, and the shortening-induced longitudinal inertia and nonlinear modal coupling of the first few modes make the effective modal damping of the first mode nonlinear."
"Scheduling for single agile satellite, redundant targets problem using complex networks theory","Xin-Wei Wang, Zhen Chen, Chao Han, ","Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, Volume 83, February 2016, Pages 125-132, ","Scheduling for the Earth observation satellites (EOSs) imaging mission is a complicated combinatorial optimization problem, especially for the agile EOSs (AEOSs). The increasing observation requirements and orbiting satellites have exacerbated the scheduling complexity in recent years. In this paper, the single agile satellite, redundant observation targets scheduling problem is studied. We introduce the theory of complex networks and find similarities between AEOS redundant targets scheduling problem and the node centrality ranking problem. Then we model this problem as a complex network, regarding each node as a possible observation opportunity, and define two factors, node importance factor and target importance factor, to describe the node/target importance. Based on the two factors, we propose a fast approximate scheduling algorithm (FASA) to obtain the effective scheduling results. Simulation results indicate the FASA is quite efficient and with broad suitability. Our work is helpful in the EOSs and AEOSs scheduling problems by using complex network knowledge."
Dye-Independent Methods Reveal Elevated Mitochondrial Mass in Hematopoietic Stem Cells,"Mariana Justino de Almeida, Larry L. Luchsinger, David J. Corrigan, Linda J. Williams, Hans-Willem Snoeck, ","Cell Stem Cell, Volume 21, Issue 6, 7 December 2017, Pages 725-729.e4, ","Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produce most cellular energy through glycolysis rather than through mitochondrial respiration. Consistent with this notion, mitochondrial mass has been reported to be low in HSCs. However, we found that staining with MitoTracker Green, a commonly used dye to measure mitochondrial content, leads to artefactually low fluorescence specifically in HSCs because of dye efflux. Using mtDNA quantification, enumeration of mitochondrial nucleoids, and fluorescence intensity of a genetically encoded mitochondrial reporter, we unequivocally show here that HSCs and multipotential progenitors (MPPs) have higher mitochondrial mass than lineage-committed progenitors and mature cells. Despite similar mitochondrial mass, respiratory capacity of MPPs exceeds that of HSCs. Furthermore, although elevated mitophagy has been invoked to explain low mitochondrial mass in HSCs, we observed that mitochondrial turnover capacity is comparatively low in HSCs. We propose that the role of mitochondria in HSC biology may have to be revisited in light of these findings.Download high-res image (222KB)Download full-size image"

A discussion on China's vehicle fuel policy: Based on the development route optimization of refining industry,"Lingying Pan, Pei Liu, Zheng Li, ","Energy Policy, Volume 114, March 2018, Pages 403-412, ","In recent years, Chinese government has been accelerating the implementation of high-quality standard of petroleum products. National Standard V of gasoline and diesel will be put into effect by 2018. However, as most of the gasoline and diesel are supplied by domestic refineries, whether the domestic refineries are capable to produce National Standard V products remains a question. This paper develops a mix integer programming model for long-term development route of refining industry in China from 2015 to 2050. The model provides optimal route of refinery construction, upgrading and retirement under different scenarios. Three scenarios are designed to discuss the mutual influence between long-term development of refining industry and fuel quality standard implementation. In the three scenarios, the schedule of 100%-National-Standard-V refining capacity target should be realized by 2018, 2030 and 2040 respectively. Based on the modeling results, we conclude that the 100%-National-Standard-V target by 2018 is difficult to realize. Putting off the schedule to 2030 is more practical in consideration of the current situation in China. To realize the 2030 target, extra investment for building new refineries and upgrading existing ones is needed in short term. However, impulse investment will result in over-capacity problem in the future."
A new measurement for structural uncertainty propagation based on pseudo-probability distribution,"Jie Liu, Hao Liu, Chao Jiang, Xu Han, Yi Feng Hu, ","Applied Mathematical Modelling, Volume 63, November 2018, Pages 744-760, ","Uncertainty propagation (UP) offers a powerful tool for describing uncertainties from input parameters to output responses in a system. The existing methods of non-probabilistic UP can only evaluate the upper and lower bounds of structural responses. In this study, a new non-probabilistic UP method is proposed, attempting to provide more detailed quantification of uncertain responses between the lower and upper bounds. A concept of pseudo-probability distribution is proposed under the non-probabilistic UP frame to quantify the possibilities of system responses. The uncertainties of structural parameters are modeled as a multi-dimensional ellipsoid convex set in the proposed UP method. The ellipsoid domain is divided into two parts using the first-order approximation of the system-state function. Then the volume ratio of the divided domain and the whole ellipsoid domain can be used to calculate the pseudo-probability of system responses. The sequential improved Hasofer-Lind-Rackwitz-Fiessler (iHL-RF) algorithm is adopted to effectively obtain the most probable expansive point of system-state function. The proposed UP method can not only provide accurate response bounds, but also objectively quantify the relatively accurate possibilities of each response value. In the numerical examples, the proposed UP method is compared with the Monte Carlo simulation method and traditional non-probabilistic uncertainty propagation method, and the calculated results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed UP method."
"Source contributions to water-soluble organic carbon and water-insoluble organic carbon in PM2.5 during Spring Festival, heating and non-heating seasons","Jie Wen, Guoliang Shi, Yingze Tian, Gang Chen, Yinchang Feng, ","Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, Volume 164, 30 November 2018, Pages 172-180, ","To investigate the influences of anthropogenic activities on carbon aerosols, especially on water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), PM2.5 samples were collected at an urban site in a northern city of China during Spring Festival (SF), heating season (HS), and non-heating season (NHS). Carbonaceous species and ions (Ca2+, SO42-, NO3-, etc.) were analyzed. Mass concentrations of WSOC and WSIC exhibited higher levels in SF and HS, and high WSOC/OC ratios (67.4%) on average were found. Stronger correlations between WSOC and K+, Cl- occurred in SF, which might due to contributions of firework emissions. Six major sources of PM2.5 were quantified by PMF model, which contributed in aerosol mass differently in different periods: biomass & firework burning exhibited higher contribution (11.2%) in SF; crustal dust accounted for 19.4% during NHS; secondary particles contributed most (41.0%) in HS; during SF and HS, coal combustion devoted more to aerosol mass. Contributions to WSOC were in the order of vehicular exhaust (41.0% of WSOC) > coal combustion (29.3%) > secondary formation (17.0%) > biomass & firework burning (12.7%). The 82.0% of WIOC were from coal combustion and the rest were devoted by vehicular exhaust. Obvious peaks of firework burning contributions to WSOC were observed on SF＊s Eve and Lantern Festival. Coal combustion contributed to organic carbons highly in SF and HS. Results implied that anthropogenic activities contributions, like firework burning and coal combustion, significantly influenced the levels of PM2.5 and WSOC."

"A Prospective, Randomized Trial of Clear Liquids Versus Low-Fat Solid Diet as the Initial Meal in Mild Acute Pancreatitis","Brian C. Jacobson, Martha B. Vander Vliet, Michael D. Hughes, Rie Maurer, Peter A. Banks, ","Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Volume 5, Issue 8, August 2007, Pages 946-951, ","Background & Aims: Patients recovering from mild acute pancreatitis typically receive a clear liquid diet (CLD) when ready to initiate oral nutrition. Patient discharge then depends on their successful advancement to solid food. We hypothesized that initiating oral nutrition with a low-fat solid diet (LFSD) after mild pancreatitis would be well tolerated and would result in a shorter length of hospitalization (LOH). Methods: Patients with mild pancreatitis were randomized to a CLD or LFSD when they were ready to resume oral nutrition. Decisions about diet advancement and hospital discharge were at the discretion of the medical team, without input from study team members. Patients were monitored daily for recurrence of pain, need to stop feeding, post-refeeding LOH (primary end point), and for 28 days post-refeeding to capture re-admission rates. Results: We randomized 121 patients: 66 to CLD and 55 to LFSD. The number of patients requiring cessation of feeding because of pain or nausea was similar in both groups (6% for CLD, 11% for LFSD; P = .51). The median LOH after refeeding was identical in both groups (1-day interquartile range, 1每2; P = .77). Patients in the LFSD arm consumed significantly more calories and grams of fat than those in the CLD arm during their first meal and on study day 1. There was no difference in the 28-day re-admission rates between the 2 arms. Conclusions: Initiating oral nutrition after mild acute pancreatitis with an LFSD appeared safe and provided more calories than a CLD, but did not result in a shorter LOH."

Scalable Visualizations of Object-Oriented Systems with Ownership Trees,"TRENT HILL, JAMES NOBLE, JOHN POTTER, ","Journal of Visual Languages & Computing, Volume 13, Issue 3, June 2002, Pages 319-339, ","Executing object-oriented programs have a complex structure consisting of numerous objects connected by interobject references. This structure, called the program's object graph, is hard to understand, and this complicates learning, teaching, debugging and maintaining object-oriented programs. While visualization can be used to display object graphs, the size and complexity of typical object graphs also makes visualization difficult. We have developed ownership trees as a simple yet powerful method of extracting a program's implicit encapsulation structure from its object graph. We have developed a program visualization tool that makes use of ownership trees to display the structure of object-oriented programs. Because ownership trees are independent of scale〞the relationship between a whole object-oriented system and its top-level components is the same as the relationship between a low-level data structure and the objects that implement it〞our software visualization is applicable at all levels of abstraction within a program's design."
The two-warehouse material location selection problem,"Phichet Wutthisirisart, Mustafa Y. Sir, James S. Noble, ","International Journal of Production Economics, Volume 170, Part C, December 2015, Pages 780-789, ","Companies often require additional warehouse space due to increased demand and often the option of building a warehouse is not feasible due to a high investment cost. As a result excess inventory that cannot be stored in owned warehouses is transferred to third-party warehouses for which the company pays rent, as well as incurs labor and transportation costs for storing items and moving items back to the production site. In this situation, the company ends up with two warehouses 每 owned and rented. This research introduces the material location selection problem that allocates materials to these two warehouses while minimizing the total storage and transportation costs. Four material location models/policies, each with different decision restrictions, are proposed to solve the problem from different material handling perspectives. The four models are analyzed and contrasted with each other based on data derived from a real industrial scenario. The case results show a cost savings opportunity between 20每40% due to reassigning materials between the rented and owned warehouses."
"Developmental changes affecting lectin binding in the vomeronasal organ of domestic pigs, Sus scrofa","Junwoo Park, Wonho Lee, Chanwoo Jeong, Hwangryong Kim, Taekyun Shin, ","Acta Histochemica, Volume 114, Issue 1, January 2012, Pages 24-30, ","This study investigated the developmental changes of glycoconjugate patterns in the porcine vomeronasal organs (VNOs) and associated glands (Jacobson's glands) from prenatal (9 weeks of gestation) and postnatal (2 days after birth) to the sexually mature stage (6 months old). The VNO of pigs (Sus scrofa) was examined using the following: Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin isolectin B4 (BSI-B4), Triticum vulgaris agglutinin (WGA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I), and soybean agglutinin (SBA). At the fetal stage, all lectins examined were detected mainly in the free border of the vomeronasal epithelium, but few (WGA and UEA-I) and or absent in the VNO cell bodies. At the postnatal and sexually mature stages, the reactivity of some lectins, including WGA, UEA-I, DBA and SBA, were shown to increase in the VNO sensory epithelium as well as the free border. The increased reactivity of lectins as development progressed was also observed in Jacobson's gland acini. These findings suggest that binding sites of lectins, including those of WGA, UEA-I, DBA, and SBA, increase during development from fetal to postnatal growth, possibly contributing to the increased ability of chemoreception in the pig."
Disparity of reperfusion arrhythmias after reversible myocardial ischemia in open chest and conscious dogs,"Roberto Bolli, Mary Lee Myers, Wei-Xi Zhu, Robert Roberts, ","Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Volume 7, Issue 5, May 1986, Pages 1047-1056, ","Myocardial reperfusion after brief, reversible ischemia is frequently associated with malignant arrhythmias in experimental animals. These observations have been extrapolated to humans despite being restricted to anesthetized, open chest preparations. No data are available regarding the incidence of reperfusion arrhythmias after reversible (< 20 minutes) ischemia in the conscious state. Thus, reperfusion arrhythmias after a 15 minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery were compared in 24 open chest dogs (17 anesthetized with pentobarbital and 7 with chloralose plus urethane) and 25 conscious, unsedated, trained dogs. The incidence of all rhythm disorders (single premature ventricular complexes, pairs, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation) was markedly and significantly lower in conscious than in either pentobarbital- or chloralose-anesthetized dogs. The disparity was not accounted for by differences in coronary collateral flow, coronary reactive hyperemia or occluded bed size. The conscious animals, however, exhibited lower heart rates and arterial pressures during reperfusion than did the open chest dogs, suggesting a lower level of adrenergic stimulation, which might have contributed to the reduced incidence of reperfusion arrhythmias.Coronary reperfusion after 15 minutes of occlusion is unlikely to precipitate ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the conscious, trained dog, even after severe ischemia. The occurrence of these rhythm disorders in anesthetized models may reflect the influence of surgical trauma or excessive adrenergic activity, or both. Reperfusion arrhythmias after reversible ischemia may be considerably less common in the clinical setting than previously postulated on the basis of open chest animal experiments."
Geometrically exact 3D beam element for arbitrary large rigid-elastic deformation analysis of aerospace structures,"Genyong Wu, Xingsuo He, P. Frank Pai, ","Finite Elements in Analysis and Design, Volume 47, Issue 4, April 2011, Pages 402-412, ","This paper presents a geometrically exact beam theory and a corresponding displacement-based finite-element formulation for modeling and analysis of highly flexible beam components of multibody systems undergoing huge static/dynamic rigid-elastic deformations. This beam theory fully accounts for geometric nonlinearities and initial curvatures of beams by using Jaumann strains, concepts of local displacements and orthogonal virtual rotations, and three Euler angles to exactly describe the coordinate transformation between the undeformed and deformed configurations. To demonstrate the accuracy and capability of this nonlinear beam element, nonlinear static/dynamic analyses of three highly flexible beams are performed, including the free falling of a flexible beam after releasing from a statically twisted and bended configuration, the slewing of a flexible horizontal beam with/without a tip mass, and the spinup of a flexible helicopter rotor blade. These numerical results reveal that the proposed nonlinear beam element is accurate and versatile for modeling and analysis of multibody systems with highly flexible beam components."

Inelastic deformation and stiffness degradation of the composite were characterized by the plasticity and damage theories. An innovative plastic potential function containing variable parameters was proposed to consider particularly the anisotropy of plastic deformation in each material direction. Based on the Weibull statistical distribution of the material strength, an exponential damage state function was established to characterize stiffness degradation for the composite in each material direction. Parameters of this constitutive model were determined from experiments data. It can be found that the nonlinear stress-strain curves for the composite under off-axis tensile and shear loadings can be accurately described by the model. The yield and damage surfaces of the composite were also studied. Finally, the constitutive model was validated by analyzing the mechanical behavior of a composite plate containing a center-hole subjected to tensile load."
Ratio-based similarity analysis and consensus building for group decision making with interval reciprocal preference relations,"Zhou-Jing Wang, Jian Lin, ","Applied Soft Computing, Volume 42, May 2016, Pages 260-275, ","Similarity analysis and preference information aggregation are two important issues for consensus building in group decision making with preference relations. Pairwise ratings in an interval reciprocal preference relation (IRPR) are usually regarded as interval-valued And-like representable cross ratios (i.e., interval-valued cross ratios for short) from the multiplicative perspective. In this paper, a ratio-based formula is introduced to measure similarity between a pair of interval-valued cross ratios, and its desirable properties are provided. We put forward ratio-based similarity measurements for IRPRs. An induced interval-valued cross ratio ordered weighted geometric (IIVCROWG) operator with interval additive reciprocity is developed to aggregate interval-valued cross ratio information, and some properties of the IIVCROWG operator are presented. The paper devises an importance degree induced IRPR ordered weighted geometric operator to fuse individual IRPRs into a group IRPR, and discusses the derivation of its associated weights. By employing ratio-based similarity measurements and IIVCROWG-based aggregation operators, a soft consensus model including a generation mechanism of feedback recommendation rules is further proposed to solve group decision making problems with IRPRs. Three numerical examples are examined to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the developed models."

Furthermore, the produced oxide layer on WCC coating was found to be more stable due to the reaction of CoO and WO3. As a result, during oxyacetylene torch ablation test, compared with pure WC coating and WCS coating, WCC coating keeps excellent dimensional stability with the linear ablation rate decreased by 67% and 62%, respectively, showing a significant improvement of the ablation resistance."
Age-Related Changes in Human Lens Crystallins Identified by HPLC and Mass Spectrometry,"ZHIXIANG MA, STACY R. A. HANSON, KIRSTEN J. LAMPI, LARRY L. DAVID, JEAN B. SMITH, ","Experimental Eye Research, Volume 67, Issue 1, July 1998, Pages 21-30, ","Analysis of water-soluble crystallins from human lenses, ages 32 week fetal to 55 years has led to identification of the major modifications of the proteins comprising the lens. These modifications were identified by the masses of the proteins determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry after the proteins were separated by gel filtration and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Examination of all the proteins isolated from the water soluble portion demonstrated that the major age-related modifications causing significant alteration in the molecular weights of the lens crystallins include truncation of the N-termini of 汕B1, 汕A3 and 汕A1, and partial phosphorylation and C-terminal degradation of 汐-crystallins.N-terminal degradation of 汕B1, 汕A3 and 汕A1 was evident in human lenses less than one year old, and the proportion of these truncated proteins became greater with age. Phosphorylation of 汐A- and 汐B-crystallins increased from the fetal to the 3 year old lens, but did not change with further aging. Minor components indicating truncation of the C-termini of 汐-crystallins were found in older lenses. In contrast to 汕B1, 汕A3 and 汕A1, the masses of the major species of 汐A, 汐B, 汕B2, 汕A4, 污S, 污C, and 污D did not change with aging. This suggested that the major modifications to these crystallins are limited to deamidation and possibly intra-molecular disulfide bonds. These data, in conjunction with the data in the accompanying manuscript, established deamidation as a common modification, since deamidation, which causes only a one dalton change in mass, is the only modification that is consistent with the absence of a detectable change in molecular weight and the observed increased acidity demonstrated in the two-dimensional gels of the accompanying paper. Other age related changes included a decrease in 汕B3 (Mr24224), a major component of the fetal lens, which was not detected in lenses older than 3 years, and increases in the ratios of 汐B:汐A and 污S:污C."
The value of exercise testing in patients with coronary artery spasm,"Ramon Castello, Eduardo Alegria, Alvaro Merino, Maria Luisa Fidalgo, Diego Martinez-Caro, ","American Heart Journal, Volume 119, Issue 2, Part 1, February 1990, Pages 259-263, ","To analyze the usefulness of a single exercise test to predict the presence of fixed obstructive coronary artery disease in patients with active coronary spasm, 91 consecutive patients with angiographically proven symptomatic coronary artery spasm who had performed a symptom-limited exercise test within the week before diagnostic coronary angiography were studied. Coronary angiography revealed significant coronary obstructions in 61 patients (67%). According to the type of angina, the prevalence of significant coronary stenosis was 53% for patients with angina at rest, 68% for those with effort angina, and 92% for those with mixed angina. Exercise-induced ST segment elevation was present in eight patients (9%), ST segment depression was seen in 37 patients (41%), and no ST abnormalities in 46 (50%). There was not a significant relationship between the ST segment response to exercise and the clinical variables assessed except for coronary anatomy. Abnormal exercise test results were significantly more frequent in patients with significant coronary obstructions than in those without significant coronary occlusions (62% versus 23%; p<0.01). ST elevation was not useful to predict the presence of fixed coronary lesions. However, ST depression strongly suggested the presence of underlying coronary lesions with a sensitivity of 54%, a specificity of 87%, and a positive predictive value of 89%. Using this criterion, 65% of the patients were correctly classified. The results indicate that despite the functional component of ischemia in patients with coronary spasm, ST segment depression with exercise is still a highly specific sign with a high positive predictive value for the presence of significant coronary artery disease. Thus a single exercise test in these patients might be useful to identify those with underlying fixed coronary obstructions."

Farach-Carson, ","Vitamin D (Third Edition), 2011, Pages 457-467, ","Tight regulation of plasma and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations is essential to ensure proper cellular function and phenotype for essentially all cells in complex tissue. Intracellular Ca2+ levels remain in dynamic balance due to the activity of channels, pumps, and exchangers present in the plasma membrane and within organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and nuclei. Organelles and intracellular Ca2+ binding proteins only transiently buffer cytosolic increases. The majority of intracellular Ca2+ regulation is accomplished by extrusion of Ca2+ into the extracellular space by the concerted efforts of Ca2+-ATPases and Na+/Ca2+ exchangers. Uptake of Ca2+ into the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum is an additional mode of buffering intracellular Ca2+. Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations result from release of Ca2+ from internal stores in the endoplasmic reticulum through leak channels and by extracellular influx of Ca2+ through a variety of membrane channels that include voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs), voltage-insensitive calcium channels (VICCs), mechanosensitive divalent cation channels (MDCCs) and receptor-operated calcium channels (ROCs). Plasma membrane Ca2+ channel activity is modulated by various mechanisms including the influence of calcitropic hormones such as 1,25(OH)2D3, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and by mechanical stimuli. VSCCs are major regulators of Ca2+ permeability in osteoblasts and are the major Ca2+ channels expressed in the plasma membrane of these cells."
On the inverse design of discontinuous abrasive surface to lower friction-induced temperature in grinding: An example of engineered abrasive tools,"Hao Nan Li, Dragos Axinte, ","International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture, Volume 132, September 2018, Pages 50-63, ","In order to lower temperature, abrasive tools with passive-grinding, e.g. textured, areas (PGA) have been suggested. However, most of the reported PGA geometries (e.g. slots, holes) have been determined based on the engineering intuition (i.e. trial and error) rather than in-depth phenomenological analysis. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a method to design the PGA geometry according to the desired temperature, i.e. the inverse design method. In the method, the analytical model of grinding temperature for tools with PGA is established and treated as the primary constraint in the inverse problem, while the models of the ground surface roughness and grinding continuity as the subsidiary constraints. The method accuracy is validated by conducting grinding trials with tools with the calculated PGA geometries and comparing their performances (temperature, roughness and force fluctuation) to the required ones. In comparison with conventional tools, our tools designed by the method have been found effective to reduce harmful, or even destructive, thermal effects on the ground surfaces. This work might lay foundation for designing discontinuous abrasive tools, and future work can be probably extended to the tools or the workpiece with more complex shapes (e.g. ball end/cup tools, and free-form workpiece)."

One-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) is the direct precursor of ethylene synthesized by plants. Bacteria possessing ACC deaminase activity can use ACC as a nitrogen source preventing ethylene production. Several salt-tolerant bacterial strains displaying ACC deaminase activity were isolated from rice fields, and their plant growth-promoting (PGP) properties were determined. Among them, strain P23, identified as an Enterobacter sp. based on phenotypic characteristics, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry data and the 16S rDNA sequence, was selected as the best-performing isolate for several PGP traits, including phosphate solubilization, IAA production, siderophore production, HCN production, etc. Enterobacter sp. P23 was shown to promote rice seedling growth under salt stress, and this effect was correlated with a decrease in antioxidant enzymes and stress-induced ethylene. Isolation of an acdS mutant strain enabled concluding that the reduction in stress-induced ethylene content after inoculation of strain P23 was linked to ACC deaminase activity."

Causton, Christopher F. Higgins, ","Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 221, Issue 1, 5 September 1991, Pages 81-95, ","Two 3∩-5∩ exoribonucleases, polynucleotide phosphorylase and ribonuclease II play a central role in the degradation of bacterial mRNA to ribonucleotides. Sequences with the potential to form stem-loop structures can stabilize upstream mRNA against 3∩-5∩ exoribonucleolytic attack in vivo by blocking the processive activities of these enzymes. For many mRNA species stem-loop structures appear to provide a very efficient block to decay from the 3∩ end, such that the rate-determining step for mRNA decay occurs elsewhere in the transcript. We have examined the stalling of 3∩-5∩ exoribonucleases at stem-loop structures in vitro. Although stem-loop structures alone can impede the progress of both enzymes, the duration of stalling at these structures in vitro is insufficient to account for the increased half-lives that they confer on mRNA in vivo. These data suggest that an additional factor, such as a stem-loop binding protein, is required for stabilization of mRNA by stem-loop structures in vivo. The implications for the regulation of mRNA stability are discussed."

The kCMS query will enable a new set of location-based applications that the traditional skyline queries cannot offer. To answer the kCMS query, we propose two efficient query algorithms, which leverage a suite of techniques including the sorting and threshold mechanisms, reusing technique, and heuristics pruning to incrementally and quickly generate combinations of possible query results.

The survey comprised five sections, including: 1) attitudes towards common ethical situations, 2) responses to specific ethical scenarios, 3) emergency lending, 4) perceived level of difficulty in resolving ethical dilemmas, and 5) demographics.Over 90% of students agreed or strongly agreed that pharmacists have the right to refuse to dispense a medication for clinical reasons, while 45.3% agreed or strongly agreed that pharmacists had the right to refuse to dispense for moral or religious reasons. Greater than 20% of students were undecided about dispensing syringes without a prescription, pseudoephedrine tablets to a frequent purchaser, and lethal doses of narcotics. In eight out of nine cases involving ethical decision-making, over 70% of students perceived the decision to be somewhat problematic.Exploration of student pharmacists＊ perceptions of specific ethical situations assists in identifying areas of uncertainty in decision-making and informing educational interventions that may foster ethical development of future pharmacy professionals."

Modified artificial bee colony algorithm for scheduling optimization for printed circuit board production,"Cheng-Jian Lin, Mei-Ling Huang, ","Journal of Manufacturing Systems, Volume 44, Part 1, July 2017, Pages 1-11, ","The production scheduling of placement machines strongly influences the efficiency of printed circuit board (PCB) production. This study focuses on the scheduling optimization for PCB production, that is, on maximizing throughput and minimizing total assembly time and head moving distance. Three problems〞the automatic nozzle changer (ANC) assignment problem, the nozzle assignment problem, and the component pick-and-place sequence problem〞are investigated using a modified artificial bee colony algorithm (MABCA) to enhance the production efficiency of placement machines.The proposed scheduling optimization algorithm comprises three phases. First, the proportional distribution method is applied to optimize ANC assignment. Second, considering the component height as well as the pick, simultaneous pickup, and component shape restrictions, the MABCA generates the nozzle assignment. Third, under the constraints of place restriction and the predetermined nozzle assignment, the MABCA and the 2-opt algorithm generates the place sequence with the minimal PCB assembly time. Finally, the proposed algorithm is experimentally demonstrated. The average number of pickups in the solutions generated by the proposed method, the onsite engineer, and two related studies are 159.3, 167.2, 208.6, and 210.6, respectively. The proposed approach yields the least PCB assembly time. The average total assembly time (Ttotal) improved between on-site engineer and the proposed MABCA is 4.08%."
Spinal SHP2 Contributes to Exaggerated Incisional Pain in Adult Rats Subjected to Neonatal and Adult Incisions via PI3K,"Xu Ding, Wei Yang, Xiao-Dan Liu, Xi Yang, Jun Tai, ","Neuroscience, Volume 385, 10 August 2018, Pages 102-120, ","Neonatal injury-induced exaggeration of pain hypersensitivity after adult trauma is a significant clinical challenge. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Growing evidence shows that spinal Src homology-2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) contributes to chronic pain in adult rodents. Here we demonstrated that the phosphorylation and expression of SHP2 in synaptosomal fraction of the spinal dorsal horn are elevated in adult rats subjected to neonatal and adult incisions (nIN-IN), and the upregulation of SHP2 is highly correlated with pain hypersensitivity. Intrathecal blockade of SHP2 phosphorylation using a SHP2 protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor NSC-87877, or knockdown of SHP2 by intrathecal delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA), ameliorates mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia in nIN-IN rats. Moreover, the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in the spinal dorsal horn is significantly increased in nIN-IN rats. Intrathecal application of PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 or wortmannin, alleviates pain hypersensitivity in nIN-IN rats. Additionally, intrathecal administration of NSC-87877 or SHP2 siRNA attenuates the upregulation of PI3K. Finally, no alternation of SHP2 phosphorylation in the dorsal root ganglion and dorsal root of nIN-IN rats as well as PI3K expression in the dorsal root of nIN-IN rats intrathecally treated with NSC-87877 or SHP2 siRNA is observed. These results suggest that the phosphorylation and expression of SHP2 in the spinal dorsal horn play vital roles in neonatal incision-induced exaggeration of adult incisional pain via PI3K. Thus, SHP2 and PI3K may serve as potential therapeutic targets for exaggerated incisional pain induced by neonatal and adult injuries.Download high-res image (88KB)Download full-size image"

Four possible pathways for each reaction were explored. The advantageous pathways of the cycloadditions were certified by the free energy barriers and reaction free energies. The structural features which lead to the products with regio- and stereoselectivities were uncovered. The computational results indicated that there are two different mechanisms for these cycloaddition reactions. One is a stepwise mechanism with two transition states along the reaction path while the other is a concerted mechanism with only one transition state. The stepwise mechanism has a much lower barrier. The factors affecting the cycloaddition mechanism have been discussed.Download high-res image (64KB)Download full-size image"
Neurophysiological and morphological investigations of pheromone-sensitive sensilla on the antenna of male Trichoplusia ni,"Alan J. Grant, Robert J. O'Connell, ","Journal of Insect Physiology, Volume 32, Issue 6, 1986, Pages 503-515, ","Single sensillum recordings and scanning electron micrographs from the antenna of male cabbage looper moths, Trichoplusia ni (H邦bner), (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), reveal the existence of 2 classes of pheromone-sensitive sensilla. The sensilla from each class contain 2 receptor neurones easily differentiated from each other according to action potential amplitude. The receptor neurone producing the larger impulse is designated as ※A§ and that producing the smaller as ※B§. The 2 sensilla classes are distinguished by the differential sensitivity and specificity of their receptor neurone's response to pheromone components and by their relative rates of spontaneous activity. The A receptor neurone in high spontaneous activity sensilla (HS) is reliably excited by low doses of (Z)-7,dodecyl acetate (Z7-12:AC); whereas, the companion B receptor neurone is excited by low doses of (Z)-7,dodecenol (Z7-12:OH). The A receptor neurone in the other sensilla class (LS) is unresponsive to Z7-12:AC even when stimulus intensities are increased 10,000-fold. However, its companion B receptor neurone is reliably excited by similarly high doses of this compound. The receptor neurones of these 2 sensilla classes also differ in their spectra of responses to other compounds. Scanning electron microscopic examination of electrophysiologically classified sensilla reveal morphological differences between the 2 sensilla classes including: overall length, degree of taper and density of cuticular pores."

Anhedonia reflects impairment in making relative value judgments between positive and neutral stimuli in schizophrenia,"Gregory P. Strauss, Katherine Frost Visser, William R. Keller, James M. Gold, Robert W. Buchanan, ","Schizophrenia Research, Volume 197, July 2018, Pages 156-161, ","Anhedonia (i.e., diminished capacity to experience pleasure) has traditionally been viewed as a core symptom of schizophrenia (SZ). However, modern laboratory-based studies suggest that this definition may be incorrect, as hedonic capacity may be intact. Alternative conceptualizations have proposed that anhedonia may reflect an impairment in generating mental representations of affective value that are needed to guide decision-making and initiate motivated behavior. The current study evaluated this hypothesis in 42 outpatients with SZ and 19 healthy controls (CN) who completed two tasks: (a) an emotional experience task that required them to indicate how positive, negative, and calm/excited they felt in response to a single emotional or neutral photograph; (b) a relative value judgment task where they selected which of 2 photographs they preferred. Results indicated that SZ and CN reported similar levels of positive emotion and arousal in response to emotional and neutral stimuli; however, SZ reported higher negative affect for neutral and pleasant stimuli than CN. In the relative value judgment task, CN displayed clear preference for stimuli differing in valence; however, SZ showed less distinct preferences for positive over neutral stimuli. Findings suggest that although in-the-moment experiences of positive emotion to singular stimuli may be intact in SZ, the ability to make relative value judgments that are needed to guide decision-making is impaired. Original conceptualizations of anhedonia as a diminished capacity for pleasure in SZ may be inaccurate; anhedonia may more accurately reflect a deficit in relative value judgment that results from impaired value representation."
Continuous Epidural Anesthesia After Ureteroneocystostomy in Children,"Mark P. Cain, Douglas A. Husmann, Robert H. McLaren, Stephen A. Kramer, ","The Journal of Urology, Volume 154, Issue 2, August 1995, Pages 791-793, ","We retrospectively reviewed the records of 101 pediatric patients who underwent uncomplicated ureteral reimplantation and were treated with postoperative epidural catheters for pain management. A total of 50 pediatric patients treated without epidural anesthesia was used as the control group. Length of hospital stay, time to first bowel activity, doses of narcotics, incidence of postoperative fever and evidence of epidural catheter related morbidities were documented. The costs of postoperative epidural anesthesia versus standard analgesics were compared.There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay or return of bowel function between treatment groups. Total doses of narcotics given during the hospital stay were significantly less for the epidural group (p less than 0.05). The children given epidural anesthesia also had a significant increase in the incidence of postoperative fever (p less than 0.05) and 25 percent had catheter related problems that often resulted in early removal of the epidural catheter. The cost of pain management using an epidural catheter was significantly greater than that of the standard narcotic regimen ($708 versus $14, p less than 0.001).Continuous epidural infusion provides satisfactory pain control after ureteroneocystostomy in children without delaying hospital discharge. This technique of pain management is associated with a significant increase in the incidence of postoperative fever and overall cost compared to standard methods of postoperative pain management."
Uric acid activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases and thereafter endothelin-1 expression in rat cardiac fibroblasts,"Tzu-Hurng Cheng, Jia-Wei Lin, Hung-Hsin Chao, Yen-Ling Chen, Ju-Chi Liu, ","International Journal of Cardiology, Volume 139, Issue 1, 18 February 2010, Pages 42-49, ","The association between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular diseases has long been recognized. Elevated levels of uric acid may have a causal role in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. However, the direct effect of uric acid on cardiac cells remains unclear. Therefore, this study was aimed to examine the effect of uric acid in rat cardiac fibroblasts and to identify the putative underlying signaling pathways.Cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts were stimulated with uric acid; cell proliferation and endothelin-1 (ET-1) gene expression were examined. The effect of uric acid on NADPH oxidase activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) phosphorylation were tested to elucidate the intracellular mechanism of uric acid in ET-1 gene expression.Uric acid-increased cell proliferation and ET-1 gene expression. Uric acid also increased NADPH oxidase activity, ROS formation, ERK phosphorylation, and activator protein-1 (AP-1)-mediated reporter activity. Antioxidants suppressed uric acid-induced ET-1 gene expression, and ERK phosphorylation, and AP-1 reporter activities. Mutational analysis of the ET-1 gene promoter showed that AP-1 binding site was an important cis-element in uric acid-induced ET-1 gene expression.These results suggest that uric acid-induced ET-1 gene expression, partially by the activation of ERK pathway via ROS generation in cardiac fibroblasts."
Fabrication and theoretical explanation of the superhydrophobic CuZn coating with dandelion-like CuO microstructure,"Hao Li, Sirong Yu, ","Journal of Alloys and Compounds, Volume 691, 15 January 2017, Pages 195-205, ","In this work, a CuZn coating with dandelion-like CuO microstructure was fabricated on pipeline steel surface by a simple two-step combined method of electrodeposition and chemical oxidation. This coating was then coated with a thin pentadecafluorooctanoic acid to achieve superhydrophobic, with the contact angle of water about 156.81∼ and the sliding angle around 3∼. When a water droplet contacted on the CuZn coating surface, the dandelion-like CuO microstructure was seen as the dual-scale structure that was proposed to be composed of spherical and pillared microstructures. Based on the Wenzel's and Cassie's formulas, the theoretical explanation was used to confirm the Cassie-Cassie wetted state between water droplet and the dandelion-like hierarchical superhydrophobic coating according to the geometric parameters of the surface morphology. Meanwhile, the superhydrophobic CuZn coating had the ability to repel the impinging water droplets and excellent long-term, thermal, solution immersion and chemical stability. Such robust superhydrophobic CuZn coating with hierarchical microstructures was expected to have various potential applications in our daily life."
Probability assessments of identified parameters for stochastic structures using point estimation method,"Jie Liu, Yifeng Hu, Can Xu, Chao Jiang, Xu Han, ","Reliability Engineering & System Safety, Volume 156, December 2016, Pages 51-58, ","In this paper, a kind of inverse problem for assessing the probabilities of identified parameters with uncertainties in structural parameters and limited experimental results is investigated. The point estimation method and maximum entropy principle are adopted to efficiently evaluate the effect of uncertain parameters on the identified parameters. First, the probability distribution function of each uncertain parameter can be approximately represented by several nodes. Thus, the uncertain inverse problem can be transformed into several deterministic inverse problems through multivariate Taylor expansion and point estimation method. Then, to obtain the moments of identified parameters, the deterministic inverse process for each selected node with concentrated probability are conducted by the genetic algorithm. Finally, the probability distribution functions of the identified parameters can be assessed by the obtained moments based on the maximum entropy principle. The proposed method effectively avoids the low efficiency of uncertain inverse problem, which commonly involves a double-loop procedure with uncertainty propagation and inverse calculation. Numerical examples and the engineering application demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method."

"Probing interactions between the coagulants thrombin, Factor XIII, and fibrin(ogen)","Muriel C. Maurer, Toni A. Trumbo, Giulia Isetti, Brian T. Turner, ","Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Volume 445, Issue 1, 1 January 2006, Pages 36-45, ","Thrombin cleaves fibrinopeptides A and B from fibrinogen leading to the formation of a fibrin network that is later covalently crosslinked by Factor XIII (FXIII). Thrombin helps activate FXIII by catalyzing hydrolysis of the FXIII activation peptides (AP). In the current work, the role of exosites in the ternary thrombin每FXIII每fibrin(ogen) complex was further explored. Hydrolysis studies indicate that thrombin predominantly utilizes its active site region to bind extended Factor XIII AP (FXIII AP 33每64 and 28每56) leaving the anion-binding exosites for fibrin(ogen) binding. The presence of fibrin-I leads to improvements in the Km for hydrolysis of FXIII AP (28每41), whereas peptides based on the cardioprotective FXIII V34L sequence exhibit less reliance on this cofactor. Surface plasmon resonance measurements reveal that d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone每thrombin binds to fibrinogen faster than to FXIII a2 and dissociates from fibrinogen more slowly than from FXIII a2. This system of thrombin exosite interactions with differing affinities promotes efficient clot formation."

Implicit ownership types for memory management,"Tian Zhao, Jason Baker, James Hunt, James Noble, Jan Vitek, ","Science of Computer Programming, Volume 71, Issue 3, 1 May 2008, Pages 213-241, ","The Real-time Specification for Java (RTSJ) introduced a range of language features for explicit memory management. While the RTSJ gives programmers fine control over memory use and allows linear allocation and constant-time deallocation, the RTSJ relies upon dynamic runtime checks for safety, making it unsuitable for safety critical applications. We introduce ScopeJ, a statically-typed, multi-threaded, object calculus in which scopes are first class constructs. Scopes reify allocation contexts and provide a safe alternative to automatic memory management. Safety follows from the use of an ownership type system that enforces a topology on run-time patterns of references. ScopeJ＊s type system is novel in that ownership annotations are implicit. This substantially reduces the burden for developers and increases the likelihood of adoption. The notion of implicit ownership is particularly appealing when combined with pluggable type systems, as one can apply different type constraints to different components of an application depending on the requirements without changing the source language. In related work we have demonstrated the usefulness of our approach in the context of highly-responsive systems and stream processing."

One hundred consecutive patients with left ITA grafts were studied prospectively and compared with a consecutive retrospective group of 100 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with saphenous vein grafts only. Preoperative, postoperative day (POD) 2, POD 6, and postoperative week 8 chest roentgenograms were analyzed for atelectasis and effusion. Postoperative left lower lobe atelectasis was common in both groups on both POD 2 (saphenous vein, 43%, versus ITA, 53%; not significant) and POD 6 (saphenous vein, 40%, versus ITA, 41%; not significant). There was a significantly higher incidence of pleural effusion on POD 6 in the ITA group (84% versus 47%; p < 0.05) but most of these were small. There was more chest tube drainage (1,413 versus 1,028 mL; p < 0.01) and a greater need for secondary thoracostomy or thoracentesis (4% versus 0%) in the ITA group. The left pleural space was opened in 67 of the 100 ITA patients but pleurotomy did not appear to influence postoperative morbidity. We conclude that use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary artery bypass grafting results in a small but significant increase in pleuropulmonary morbidity."

Hidden Markov model with auto-correlated observations for remaining useful life prediction and optimal maintenance policy,"Zhen Chen, Yaping Li, Tangbin Xia, Ershun Pan, ","Reliability Engineering & System Safety, In press, corrected proof, Available online 20 September 2017, ","In this paper, a hidden Markov model with auto-correlated observations (HMM-AO) is developed to handle the degradation modeling of manufacturing systems. Unlike the standard hidden Markov models (HMMs), the current observation in the HMM-AO model not only depends on the corresponding hidden system state, but also on the previous observations. A novel algorithm using the expectation maximum is presented to estimate the unknown parameters. Furthermore, missing data and noise that accumulate over time are also considered by modifying the proposed model. Then two remaining useful life prediction methods based on the HMM-AO model are developed. Predictive values of more accuracy can be obtained, since the autocorrelation of observations has been considered and the temporal evolution of degradation processes has been described properly. A case study is illustrated to highlight the advantages of HMM-AO and demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the prediction methods. Furthermore, an improved maintenance policy is developed based on the results of remaining useful life prediction. Finally, a comparison with a conventional condition-based maintenance policy is provided to prove the performance of this proposed policy."

In present study we attempted to evaluate the serological tests vis-a-vis PCR for diagnosis of caprine brucellosis. Commonly used different serological test (viz.; recombinant Omp31 based ELISA (rELISA), dot-ELISA, B. melitensis whole antigen based ELISA (pELISA), SAT, CFT, RBPT and AGPT) were employed for diagnosis of brucellosis in 138 abattoir bound animals having history of abortion. Same animals were subjected to tissue PCR based on 07 different commonly used target genes (viz.; 16s rRNA, 16s-23s rRNA, BCSP-31, L7/L12, Omp2b, Omp31 and BP26) for detection of B. melitensis in goats. Diagnostic efficiencies and logistic analysis of serological assays indicated that rELISA and dot-ELISA combination is the best for detection of anti B. melitensis antibodies in goats. On the other hand, diagnostic efficiencies and logistic analysis of different gene based PCR revealed that for genus based identification of Brucella organism 16s rRNA and 16s-23 rRNA gene is the best target while for species based identification Omp31 and BP26 gene targets are the suitable. Study was also performed on the possible combination and logistic regressions of different gene based PCR and serological assays which shown the maximum probability of 16SrRNA and 16S-23SrRNA gene based PCR and rELISA and Dot-ELISA for serological assays. The sensitivity and specificity of serological and PCR-based methods used was also determined. It was concluded that, in goats, the sensitivity and specificity of most serological and PCR-based methods are not well established and their real value for use with clinical samples and hence diagnosis has not been validated. There is still a great deal of work required for verification, validation, establishment of standards before we establish accurate diagnosis of brucellosis in goats."
Nitrate metabolism of the red tide dinoflagellate Gonyaulax polyedra Stein,"William G.

Less pronounced light-dark variations in nitrate assimilation and a greater stability of the nitrate assimilatory enzymes, together with the ability to migrate into nitrate-rich subsurface waters at night, probably give G. polyedra and other red tide dinoflagellates a competitive advantage over coastal diatoms during the ＆upwelling season＊, when most red tides occur."

Fuzzy Confidence Measures in Midlevel Vision,"JAMES M.

High-level vision systems can utilize measures of confidence in scene component labeling to prioritize investigation, resolve conflict, allocate resources, etc,. if such measures are provided by the midlevel vision subsystem. A methodology based on the theory of fuzzy sets is presented which can be used to produce linguistic, i.e., natural language, confidence measures of object labeling in natural scenes. The linguistic structure models the uncertainty and complexity and allows for easy incorporation of high-level ancillary information, such as weather conditions and sensor motion. The use of the linguistic confidence structure is demonstrated in two applications. The first involves the labeling of objects in multitemporal forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sequences. The second application is in fusion of information from more than one sensor using sensor models. In both cases, new methods for automatically generating the linguistic values from the image data are described.

Nitti, David Ginsberg, Karl-Dietrich Sievert, David Sussman, 191622-096 Investigators, ","The Journal of Urology, Volume 196, Issue 3, September 2016, Pages 791-800, ","These are the final results of the prospective, multicenter, long-term (3.5-year) study of the efficacy/safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for overactive bladder syndrome.Patients who completed either of 2, 24-week phase 3 trials could enter a 3-year extension and continue treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA 100 U as needed to control overactive bladder symptoms. Data were analyzed by the treatment(s) received (up to 6) and in discrete subgroups that received 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 treatments (to evaluate the consistency of the response after repeat treatments in the same patient groups). Assessments included the change from baseline in the number of urinary incontinence episodes per day and the proportion of patients who reported improvement/great improvement in urinary symptoms on the TBS (Treatment Benefit Scale) at week 12 as co-primary end points. Other end points were the change from baseline in I-QOL (Incontinence Quality of Life), the number of urgency and micturition episodes per day; duration of effect; the number of adverse events; and the initiation of intermittent catheterization.Consistent mean reductions in urinary incontinence were observed following continued onabotulinumtoxinA treatment, ranging from 每3.1 to 每3.8 in the overall population and 每2.9 to 每4.5 in the discrete subgroups. Durable improvements were seen in overactive bladder symptoms and quality of life. A high proportion of patients rated their condition as improved/greatly improved. The median duration of effect was 7.6 months. The most common adverse event was urinary tract infection. The rate of de novo catheterization after the first treatment was 4.0% and it ranged from 0.6% to 1.7% after subsequent treatments.Long-term onabotulinumtoxinA treatment consistently decreased overactive bladder symptoms and improved quality of life with no new safety signals."
Double-averaging analysis of turbulent kinetic energy fluxes and budget based on large-eddy simulation,"Xu Han, Guo-jian He, Hong-wei Fang, ","Journal of Hydrodynamics, Ser. B, Volume 29, Issue 4, August 2017, Pages 567-574, ","The turbulent flow over a channel bed roughened by three layers of closely packed spheres with a Reynolds number of Re = 15000 is investigated using the large eddy simulation (LES) and the double-averaging (DA) method. The DA velocity is compared with the results of the corresponding laboratory experiments to validate the LES results. The existence of the types of vortex structures is demonstrated by the Q - criterion above the permeable bed. The turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) fluxes and budget are quantified and discussed. The results show that the TKE fluxes are directed downward and downstream near the virtual bed level. In the TKE budget, the form-induced diffusion rate is significant in the vicinity of the crest bed level, and the TKE production rate and the dissipation rate attain their peaks at the crest bed level and decrease sharply below it."
Separation of transition metals from rare earths by non-aqueous solvent extraction from ethylene glycol solutions using Aliquat 336,"Zheng Li, Xiaohua Li, Stijn Raiguel, Koen Binnemans, ","Separation and Purification Technology, Volume 201, 7 August 2018, Pages 318-326, ","Solvent extraction is a widely used separation technique in extractive metallurgy. A conventional solvent extraction system consists of an aqueous phase and an immiscible organic phase. In this work, we show that replacement of water by a polar organic solvent can lead to superior metal separations. Cobalt(II) and samarium(III) chlorides dissolved in water and ethylene glycol (EG), respectively, with LiCl as chloride source, were extracted by Aliquat 336 diluted in toluene. Both cobalt and samarium were extracted from the aqueous solutions, but cobalt was extracted more efficiently from the ethylene glycol solutions than from the aqueous solutions, whereas samarium was not extracted at all from the ethylene glycol solutions. As a result, cobalt and samarium could be separated completely in a single extraction step from ethylene glycol solutions. The mechanisms of cobalt extraction by Aliquat 336 from the ethylene glycol and aqueous solutions were found to be similar, as validated by slope analysis and UV每VIS absorption spectroscopy. Samarium was extracted from the aqueous solution through the salting-out effect of LiCl. Interestingly, LiCl has a much lower salting-out effect for samarium in ethylene glycol than in water due to the lower dielectric constant of ethylene glycol and the lower solubility of LiCl in ethylene glycol. Consequently, samarium is not salted out from ethylene glycol, leading to a very efficient separation of cobalt and samarium. This separation effect can also be applied to the separation of other transition metal and rare-earth metal pairs, including iron/neodymium and zinc/europium.Download high-res image (107KB)Download full-size image"
"Risk stratification on the basis of Deauville score on PET-CT and the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA after completion of primary treatment for extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type: a multicentre, retrospective analysis","Seok Jin Kim, Joon Young Choi, Seung Hyup Hyun, Chang-Seok Ki, for the Asia Lymphoma Study Group, ","The Lancet Haematology, Volume 2, Issue 2, February 2015, Pages e66-e74, ","Assessment of tumour viability after treatment is essential for prediction of treatment failure in patients with extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL). We aimed to assess the use of the post-treatment Deauville score on PET-CT and Epstein-Barr virus DNA as a predictor of residual tumour, to establish the risk of treatment failure in patients with newly diagnosed ENKTL.In a retrospective analysis of patient data we assessed the prognostic relevance of the Deauville score (five-point scale) on PET-CT and circulating Epstein-Barr virus DNA after completion of treatment in consecutive patients with ENKTL who met eligibility criteria (newly diagnosed and received non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, or both together) diagnosed at the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, South Korea. The primary aim was to assess the association between progression-free survival and risk stratification based on post-treatment Deauville score and Epstein-Barr virus DNA. With an independent cohort from two different hospitals (Hong Kong and Singapore), we validated the prognostic value of our risk model.We included 102 patients diagnosed with ENKTL between Jan 6, 2005, and Nov 18, 2013, in the study cohort, and 38 patients diagnosed with ENKTL between Jan 7, 2009, and June 27, 2013, in the validation cohort. In the study cohort after a median follow-up of 47﹞2 months (IQR 30﹞0每65﹞5), 45 (44%) patients had treatment failure and 33 (32%) had died. Post-treatment Deauville score and Epstein-Barr virus DNA positivity were independently associated with progression-free and overall survival in the multivariable analysis (for post-treatment Deauville score of 3每4, progression-free survival hazard ratio [HR] 3﹞607, 95% CI 1﹞772每7﹞341, univariable p<0﹞0001; for post-treatment Epstein-Barr virus DNA positivity, progression-free survival HR 3﹞595, 95% CI 1﹞598每8﹞089, univariable p<0﹞0001). We stratified patients into three groups based on risk of treatment failure: a low-risk group (post-treatment Epstein-Barr virus negativity and post-treatment Deauville score of 1每2), a high-risk group (post-treatment Epstein-Barr virus negativity with a Deauville score 3每4, or post-treatment Epstein-Barr virus positivity with a Deauville score 1每2), and treatment failure (Deauville score of 5 or post-treatment Epstein-Barr positivity with a Deauville of score 3每4). This risk model showed a significant association with progression-free survival (for low risk vs high risk, HR 7﹞761, 95% CI 2﹞592每23﹞233, p<0﹞0001; for low risk vs failure, HR 18﹞546, 95% CI 5﹞997每57﹞353, p<0﹞0001).

An efficient manifold regularized sparse non-negative matrix factorization model for large-scale recommender systems on GPUs,"Hao Li, Keqin Li, Jiyao An, Weihua Zheng, Kenli Li, ","Information Sciences, In press, corrected proof, Available online 27 July 2018, ","Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) plays an important role in many data mining applications for low-rank representation and analysis. Due to the sparsity that is caused by missing information in many high-dimension scenes, e.g., social networks or recommender systems, NMF cannot mine a more accurate representation from the explicit information. Manifold learning can incorporate the intrinsic geometry of the data, which is combined with a neighborhood with implicit information. Thus, manifold-regularized NMF (MNMF) can realize a more compact representation for the sparse data. However, MNMF suffers from (a) the forming of large-scale Laplacian matrices, (b) frequent large-scale matrix manipulation, and (c) the involved K-nearest neighbor points, which will result in the over-writing problem in parallelization. To address these issues, a single-thread-based MNMF model is proposed on two types of divergence, i.e., Euclidean distance and Kullback每Leibler (KL) divergence, which depends only on the involved feature-tuples＊ multiplication and summation and can avoid large-scale matrix manipulation. Furthermore, this model can remove the dependence among the feature vectors with fine-grain parallelization inherence. On that basis, a CUDA parallelization MNMF (CUMNMF) is presented on GPU computing. From the experimental results, CUMNMF achieves a 20X speedup compared with MNMF, as well as a lower time complexity and space requirement."
How effective are employer return to work programs?,"Christopher F. McLaren, Robert T. Reville, Seth A. Seabury, ","International Review of Law and Economics, Volume 52, October 2017, Pages 58-73, ","Reducing the recovery time for workers who are injured or disabled by a workplace accident is a key policy goal. This has motivated the promotion of employer-based return to work programs, despite a lack of systematic evidence on the effectiveness of such programs. We combine data on duration of time out of work for workers＊ compensation claimants with information on employer return to work programs to estimate the impact of the programs on time out of work. Discrete-time hazard estimates suggest that the workers in a program return approximately 1.4 times sooner compared to workers injured at a firm without a program. The biggest reductions in work-injury absence are experienced by men, likely due to occupational differences, and by workers with a permanent disability. Modifying work equipment is associated with the greatest reductions in injury durations relative to other program components. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that these programs are cost-effective for large, self-insured employers. More work is needed to determine whether these programs could be adopted successfully by smaller firms."

A total of 335 residents from 37 programs were invited to complete an anonymous 57-item questionnaire in May 2007. Data were categorized, and basic statistics including chi-square comparative analyses were performed.A total of 136 (40.60%) residents completed the survey. A ※passion for orthodontics§ emerged as the most important factor (20.29%) influencing the decision to pursue orthodontics as a career, followed by ※intellectual stimulation or challenge§ (18.12%). Most residents decided to become an orthodontist before they were in dental school (44.93%). Most residents (89.05%) plan to engage in private practice, and only 2 intend to pursue primarily an academic career. The average resident debt was $165,226 at the end of their program.The decision to become an orthodontist is often made early in life, before dental school, and a passion for orthodontics is the motivational factor. Residents plan to enter private practice and not pursue a career in academia. The current shortage of academics and orthodontic researchers will not be resolved from the current pool of orthodontic residents. A possible solution to the academic crisis is to change the selection criteria in programs to accept orthodontic residents who develop a passion for orthodontics while in dental school or to recruit primary researchers and teachers to the specialty. Residents plan to practice in an urban setting. Rural and underserviced areas will probably continue to experience shortages of orthodontists in the future."

Computer simulation study of differential capacitance and charging mechanism in graphene supercapacitors: Effects of cyano-group in ionic liquids,"Sungsik Jo, Sang-Won Park, Chanwoo Noh, YounJoon Jung, ","Electrochimica Acta, Volume 284, 10 September 2018, Pages 577-586, ","Molecular dynamics simulation is employed to study graphene supercapacitors. Four different ionic liquids are considered as an electrolyte, each of which is combination of the same cation 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium([emim]+), and different, cyano-containing anions, thiocyanate ([SCN]每), dicyanamide ([N(CN)2]每), tricyanomethanide ([C(CN)3]每), and tetracyanoborate ([B(CN)4]每), respectively. In particular we investigate how electric double layer structure and electrical properties are affected by the structure of cyano containing anions. Cations and anions make alternating structure near charged electrode. Differential capacitances in four ionic liquids are found to have a maximum value at negative potential. The maximum capacitances are comparable to each other, but the corresponding potential shifts to the negative side as more cyano groups are attached to the anion. Starting from the interfacial layer, the effects of the further ionic layers on differential capacitance are systematically investigated. Comparing charges of the electrode and those of ionic layers, we find that differential capacitance behavior mainly stems from the ion exchange between electric double layer and bulk region. The ion exchange behaviors are decomposed into cation and anion contributions. The differential charging mechanisms of the system are strongly dependent on the electric potential. The maximum capacitances are consequence of rapid desorption of respective anions."
Nonlinear vibration characterization by signal decomposition,"P.

Numerical results show that Hilbert每Huang transform can be used for decomposing nonlinear/non-stationary signals in order to reveal and estimate nonlinear effects. Major nonlinear phenomena that can be extracted from transient and/or steady-state dynamic responses include different nonlinearities, softening and hardening effects, intrawave amplitude- and phase-modulation, distorted harmonic responses under a single-frequency harmonic excitation, interwave amplitude- and phase-modulation, and multiple-mode vibrations caused by internal/external resonances. However, the discontinuity-induced Gibbs＊ phenomenon makes Hilbert每Huang transform analysis inaccurate around the two data ends. On the other hand, the sliding-window fitting analysis has no Gibbs＊ phenomenon at the two data ends, but it cannot extract accurate modulation frequencies due to the use of non-orthogonal basis functions in the sliding-window least-squares curve fitting process."

Experimental study of the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of suspended taut steel cables using a 3-D motion analysis system,"Jiazhu Hu, P. Frank Pai, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, Volume 329, Issue 19, 13 September 2010, Pages 3972-3998, ","This paper presents an experimental study of the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of taut steel cables using a 3-D motion analysis system. In the experiment, the taut cables have one end fixed and the other end subject to harmonic vertical excitation. The 3-D motion analysis system can simultaneously record (with high resolution) the instant 3-D coordinates of the multiple markers fixed on a vibrating cable; this distinguishes it from other experimental systems used in vibration studies, in which the vibration of only one single point can be recorded during each individual testing. With the 3-D motion analysis system, this experimental study presents a distinctive interpretation of the dynamic characteristics of taut cables in spatial domain (based on the mode-shape information of the entire cable), in addition to one in time domain (based on real-time traces of one single point). This paper introduces the 3-D motion analysis system and experimental setup, discusses practical experimental procedures, and presents a detailed analysis of three sets of experimental vibration data of three taut steel cables with different small sags. The frequency response curves were obtained for three cables. For one of the three taut cables, more informative vibration data were recorded; this cable was studied in greater detail via modal analysis using a modal decomposition technique and nonlinear time-series analysis."

For comparative purposes, a milled straw lignin from wheat straw was also studied.The pyrolytic patterns were suitable for estimating the extent to which lignin-derived material is present in the hemicellulose preparations, or hemicellulose-derived products contributed to the alkalilignin fractions. The results reflect the different efficiency of the treatments to remove lignin and carbohydrate during alkaline pulping of Gramineae straws. The virtual lack of carbohydrate-derived pyrolysis products was observed only in the alkalilignin preparation obtained with the highest NaOH concentration studied (1 M) at 30∼C for 12 h.The pyrolysis data showed that the guaiacyl fragments were dominant in the lignin associated to hemicellulose fractions, suggesting structural relationships between hemicellulose and lignin through guaiacyl type units. This was complementary to the large amounts of syringyl units that remained in the alkalilignin preparations.Although Py-GC/MS provides markers for the major classes of cell wall components, such as lignin and structural polysaccharides, it does not yield fragments which could be ascribed with certainty to cinnamic acids, which are abundant and play an important role in cereal straws as lignin〞carbohydrate linkages."

The results indicate the intensification of ASWM began to increase with Northern Hemisphere low-latitude solar insolation (LSI) and solar activity during the early Holocene, and gradually decreased during the late Holocene, exhibiting an apparent synchrony with numerous records of ASWM region. Meanwhile, an apparent 1000-a quasi-periodic signal is present in the environment proxies, and it demonstrates that the environmental change in the ASWM region has been driven mainly by LSI and solar activity.Download high-res image (291KB)Download full-size image"

Analytical solution to bending and contact strength of spiral bevel gears in consideration of friction,"Changjiang Zhou, Zuodong Li, Bo Hu, Haifei Zhan, Xu Han, ","International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, Volumes 128每129, August 2017, Pages 475-485, ","Friction is not considered in the calculation of load capacity for spiral bevel gears according to either ISO or AGMA gear standard, and friction effects on the bending, contact and shear of the gears have rarely been discussed. In this regard, the present work establishes analytical solutions to calculate bending and contact strength for spiral bevel gears incorporating friction on the tooth surface, which are verified by ISO gear standard and finite element method (FEM). The bending strength is calculated based on Lewis cantilever beam approximation, utilizing the modified normal force and the friction component. The modified normal force is derived at the highest point of single tooth contact (HPSTC) in the normal equivalent gear. Follow Hertz contact theory, the contact strength is calculated when the modified normal force and the friction component are exerted at the lowest point of single tooth contact (LPSTC) in the normal equivalent gear. The calculated bending and contact stresses agree well with those obtained from the FEM analysis while considering the influence of friction. Both theoretical predictions and FEM analysis have shown that friction has a crucial effect on load capacity of a spiral bevel gear drive, and that it exerts stronger influence on the bending strength (compared with the contact strength). When friction coefficients become larger (with the same input torque), the bending stress considering only the modified normal force decreases at HPSTC, whereas it increases if both the modified normal force and the friction component are included. In comparison, the contact stress will increase at LPSTC under both scenarios. Furthermore, it is illustrated that shear strength check of the tooth is necessary as large friction occurs in the contact zone. This developed analytical solution can be well applied to the determination of load capacity of spiral bevel gears, especially under harsh working conditions or in the demand for higher performance.Download high-res image (275KB)Download full-size image"

Poor drainage will significantly reduce the performance and durability of ballast bed. In this paper, a novel conceptual drainage and water pressure reduction system at the bottom of railway tunnel is proposed. The proposed bottom drainage system includes a transverse catchment system, a longitudinal water conducting system and a bottom-to-up water drainage system. A series numerical analyses were carried out to validate the performance of the proposed drainage system. Results show that the proposed drainage and pressure reduction system can effectively discharge the water at the bottom of the railway tunnel and reduce the water pressure. Factors that influence the performance of the proposed drainage system are also discussed by parametric studies. The permeability of the surrounding rock, the initial support and the secondary lining invert have great influences on the external water pressure. The groundwater level that influences the water pressure reduction effect are also discussed."

Stochastic induction of Theileria annulata merogony in vitro by chloramphenicol,"Jacqueline Schmuckli-Maurer, Brian Shiels, Dirk A. Dobbelaere, ","International Journal for Parasitology, Volume 38, Issue 14, December 2008, Pages 1705-1715, ","Theileria annulata inhabits the cytoplasm of bovine leukocytes where it can be found as a multinucleated schizont. The schizont is the pathogenic stage of the life cycle and by interfering with host signalling pathways, it induces unlimited host cell proliferation and protection against apoptosis. In the infected animal, the schizont differentiates to the merozoite life cycle stage in a process called merogony. This takes place within the host leukocyte, resulting in the production of merozoites that are subsequently released by leukocyte lysis. In established cultures of T. annulata-transformed cells, merogony does not spontaneously occur, but the process can be activated by a shift in temperature. In this study we show that chloramphenicol induces schizont differentiation in proliferating T. annulata-transformed cells. We demonstrate that chloramphenicol-induced merogony is inherently asynchronous and has a quantitative basis. The process is accompanied by the down-regulation of schizont-specific surface proteins, de novo expression of merozoite-specific markers such as Tamr1 and Tams1 and the morphological hallmarks of merogony. Chloramphenicol-induced parasite differentiation was found to be associated with diminished proliferation potential and extensive morphological changes of the host cell, including increased numbers of pseudopodia. Significantly, chloramphenicol treatment can accelerate merogony induced by elevated temperature, supporting postulation that the differentiation event is a stochastic process that can be manipulated to alter the outcome of parasitic infection."
Feature-based Compositing Memory Networks for Aspect-based Sentiment Classification in Social Internet of Things,"Ruixin Ma, Kai Wang, Tie Qiu, Arun Kumar Sangaiah, Hannan Bin Liaqat, ","Future Generation Computer Systems, In press, corrected proof, Available online 7 December 2017, ","Sentiment analysis is an important research field in natural language processing. Aspect-based sentiment classification can efficiently solve fine-grained sentiment recognition, however, its classification accuracy becomes decreasing for large-scale corpus. To solve this problem, we propose a new memory network model, called Feature-based Compositing Memory Networks (FCMN). Differing from typical memory networks, we extract three kinds of features to enrich the word representation of each context word. We design compositing strategies combining feature representations and word embedding to improve the performance of attention mechanism. Experiments on laptops and restaurants datasets in SemEval 2014 show that our approach outperforms the feature-based SVM, TD-LSTM and Deep Memory Networks. Especially, FCMN gets better results with less hops than Deep Memory Networks. Experiments results demonstrate that FCMN can ignore words without sentiment and pay more attention on correct words in a sentence."
Are pheromones their own reward?,"David M. Coppola, Robert J. O'Connell, ","Physiology & Behavior, Volume 44, Issue 6, 1988, Pages 811-816, ","Hamster vaginal discharge (HVD) contains a variety of intersexual pheromones which are powerful promoters of male reproductive behavior. Males avidly investigate and then consume HVD from females or from artificial sources. We measured the reward strength of HVD and other sapid substances with operant techniques. The highest fixed ratio at which males would bar press, the break point, varied with the level of water deprivation and the volume of water reward. Break points for sucrose rewards, in undeprived animals, were higher than for water and varied with concentration. Water, vanillin and HVD solutions were comparable reinforcers irrespective of deprivation level. Sexual experience did not increase bar pressing for HVD rewards. Moreover, naive animals could not be trained to bar press for HVD. These results contrast with other evidence that HVD is highly palatable and challenge the notion that the pheromones present in it are innately rewarding. However, this conclusion may be mitigated by constraints on learning which limit the utility of operant techniques to evaluate the reinforcing properties of HVD."

Thermomechanical finite-element analysis and dynamics characterization of three-plug oscillating heat pipes,"P. Frank Pai, Hao Peng, Hongbin Ma, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 64, September 2013, Pages 623-635, ","Presented here are a nonlinear thermomechanical finite-element model of U-shaped three-plug oscillating heat pipes (OHPs) and numerical methods that can accurately predict the model＊s oscillation frequency and calculate the time-varying spatial distribution of temperature and the global heat transfer efficiency. The model accounts for the influences of nonlinear spring effect of vapor bubbles, mass transferring effect, fluid filling ratio, operating temperature, gravity, pressure loss due to pipe bend, and temperature difference between the evaporator and condenser. Dynamics of OHPs is characterized using a newly developed time每frequency analysis algorithm, and an Euler predictor每corrector method with convergence check is used to solve for the temperature distribution within the fluid plug. Results show that an OHP is a parametrically excited nonlinear thermomechanical system. An explicit formula for accurate prediction of the model＊s oscillation frequency is derived, and it reveals that the oscillation frequency is mainly determined by the fluid plug mass, initial vapor pressure, and the vapor-plug-length/pipe-cross-sectional-area ratio. Parameters that determine the oscillation amplitude include the temperature difference between the evaporator and condenser, heat transfer coefficients, fluid filling ratio, and initial temperature. Moreover, the existence of gravity directing from the evaporator to the condenser increases the oscillation frequency. These results provide better understanding of heat transfer mechanisms of OHPs and can be used to optimize designs of OHPs."

In this work, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of the cutting operations on the surface integrity, and its further influence on the fatigue life. It was confirmed that the fatigue performance of the machined surface was determined by the interactions of the surface integrity characteristics, including the work hardening, surface roughness and residual stress field. The softened layer under the machined surface and the compressive residual stress field were generated under all cutting conditions, resulting in the improved fatigue life when compared to the polished specimens. The plastic deformation and the resulting work hardening on the machined surface were enhanced continuously with an increase in each of the cutting parameters, which could cause significant decrease of the fatigue performance of the workpiece. The influence of surface roughness on the fatigue performance could be overshadowed by other surface integrity characteristics, since its effect was weakened by the curved feed marks generated on the face-milled surfaces. The cutting parameters could influence the fatigue performance of the machined components significantly by changing their surface integrity."

Newbury, ","Gene, Volume 72, Issues 1每2, 10 December 1988, Pages 3-14, ","Repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences are highly conserved inverted repeats present in up to 1000 copies on the Escherichia coli chromosome. We have shown both in vivo and in vitro that REP sequences can stabilize upstream mRNA by blocking the processive action of 3' ↙ 5' exonucleases. In a number of operons, mRNA stabilization by REP sequences plays an important role in the control of gene expression. Furthermore, differential mRNA stability mediated by the REP sequences can be responsible for differential gene expression within polycistronic operons. Despite the key role of REP sequences in mRNA stability and gene expression in a number of operons, several lines of evidence suggest that this is unlikely to be the primary reason for the exceptionally high degree of sequence conservation between REP sequences. Other possible functions for REP sequences are discussed. We propose that REP sequences may be a prokaryotic equivalent of ＆selfish DNA＊ and that gene conversion may play a role in the evolution and maintenance of REP sequences."

Acoustic metamaterial beams based on multi-frequency vibration absorbers,"P. Frank Pai, Hao Peng, Shuyi Jiang, ","International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, Volume 79, February 2014, Pages 195-205, ","Presented here is a new metamaterial beam based on multi-frequency vibration absorbers for broadband vibration absorption. The proposed metamaterial beam consists of a uniform isotropic beam and small two-mass spring-mass-damper subsystems at many locations along the beam to act as multi-frequency vibration absorbers. For an infinite metamaterial beam, governing equations of a unit cell are derived using the extended Hamilton principle. The existence of two stopbands is demonstrated using a model based on averaging material properties over a cell length and a model based on finite element modeling and the Bloch每Floquet theory for periodic structures. For a finite metamaterial beam, because these two idealized models cannot be used for finite beams and/or elastic waves having short wavelengths, a finite-element method is used for detailed modeling and analysis. The concepts of negative effective mass and effective stiffness and how the spring-mass-damper subsystem creates two stopbands are explained in detail. Numerical simulations reveal that the actual working mechanism of the proposed metamaterial beam is based on the concept of conventional mechanical vibration absorbers. For an incoming wave with a frequency in one of the two stopbands, the absorbers are excited to vibrate in their optical modes to create shear forces to straighten the beam and stop the wave propagation. For an incoming wave with a frequency outside of but between the two stopbands, it can be efficiently damped out by the damper with the second mass of each absorber. Hence, the two stopbands are connected into a wide stopband. Numerical examples validate the concept and show that the structure's boundary conditions do not have significant influence on the absorption of high-frequency waves. However, for absorption of low-frequency waves, the structure's boundary conditions and resonance frequencies and the location and spatial distribution of absorbers need to be considered in design, and it is better to use heavier masses for absorbers."

The spatial periodicity of the microstructural evolution and the anti-indentation properties was explored. The results show that the as-deposited part was featured by periodic martensite laths within the block-shaped ferrite matrix in the inner layers, followed by epitaxial ferrite grains containing ultra-fine acicular martensite in the top layer only. A slightly decreased Fe intensity was caused by local elemental segregation during the re-melting process; the homogeneity of Fe and Cr was attributed to similar cooling conditions in the top layer. The martensite size gradually coarsened from the fine grain zone to the coarse grain zone and the shape transformed correspondingly from irregularly short bar-like to orderly long rod-like due to the location-related thermal history. Elongated ferrite grains exhibited a slight fiber texture in the top layer and a random crystallographic orientation in the middle region. The anti-indentation properties evolved periodically due to the periodic microstructural characteristics. The obtained experimental results confirmed higher anti-indentation properties of the as-deposited part following comparison with the as-annealed base metal, while the elastic moduli of samples were not significantly different.Download high-res image (298KB)Download full-size image"

An efficient method to reduce ill-posedness for structural dynamic load identification,"Jie Liu, Xianghua Meng, Dequan Zhang, Chao Jiang, Xu Han, ","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, Volume 95, October 2017, Pages 273-285, ","For the inverse problem of structural dynamic load identification, high system ill-posedness is a main cause leading to instability and low accuracy. In this study, an efficient interpolation-based method is proposed to reduce ill-posedness availably and identify dynamic load stably. The load history is discretized into a series of time elements, and the load profile in each time element is approximated through interpolation functions. Then, in the whole time domain, the dynamic responses under interpolation function loads are calculated through a few finite element analysis and then assembled together to form a global kernel function matrix for load identification. Using singular value decomposition (SVD), the ill-posed degree of the global kernel function matrix can be analyzed. Compared with the conventional Green kernel function method (GKFM), the ill-posedness of global kernel function matrix in the proposed method is significantly reduced. Especially, when the length of time element is selected appropriately, the global kernel function matrix is entirely well-posed and the corresponding dynamic load can be stably identified without any regularization operation. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the correctness of identified load."

In order to enhance the accuracy of damage identification, a damage index is proposed based on the 2D continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Numerical simulations demonstrate that the CWT is more sensitive to damage than gapped smoothing method (GSM), and the proposed method can identify damage quantitatively. Furthermore, a composite plate with cutout was experimentally studied. The damage around the cutout were obviously quantitatively detected by the proposed method with ODSs at high frequencies and are in high agreement with that of ultrasound testing."

Enhancement of performance monitoring of a coal-fired power plant via dynamic data reconciliation,"Sisi Guo, Pei Liu, Zheng Li, ","Energy, Volume 151, 15 May 2018, Pages 203-210, ","Wide-range and frequent operation changes have become a common phenomenon with thermal power plants in the context of fast penetration of intermittent renewable power. Performance monitoring at transient states is more important to the safety and high efficiency of power plants. Data quality is essential for conducting dynamic performance monitoring, and dynamic data reconciliation (DDR) provides great potential to enhance quality of measured data at transient states. In this paper, a moving window based approach to dynamic data reconciliation is proposed for a real coal-fired power plant using high sampling operational data. Firstly, dynamic characteristics of the system are discussed, taking account of the equipment accumulation in DDR problems. Results of case studies indicate that the data accuracy of measured mass flow parameters are enhanced effectively after DDR, and better results are obtained with the increasing time window size. Comparison with steady state data reconciliation approach is also carried out to indicate the enhanced effect of the DDR approach for the performance monitoring of a real power plant."
Cost-Effectiveness of Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation,"Paul S. Chan, Sandeep Vijan, Fred Morady, Hakan Oral, ","Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Volume 47, Issue 12, 20 June 2006, Pages 2513-2520, ","We sought to compare the cost-effectiveness of left atrial catheter ablation (LACA), amiodarone, and rate control therapy in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF).Left atrial catheter ablation has been performed to eliminate AF, but its cost-effectiveness is unknown.We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of LACA in 55- and 65-year-old cohorts with AF at moderate and low stroke risk. Costs, health utilities, and transition probabilities were derived from published literature and Medicare data. We performed primary threshold analyses to determine the minimum level of LACA efficacy and stroke risk reduction needed to make LACA cost-effective at $50,000 and $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) thresholds.In 65-year-old subjects with AF at moderate stroke risk, relative reduction in stroke risk with an 80% LACA efficacy rate for sinus rhythm restoration would need to be ≡42% and ≡11% to yield incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) <$50,000 and $100,000 per QALY, respectively. Higher and lower LACA efficacy rates would require correspondingly lower and higher stroke risk reduction for equivalent ICER thresholds. In the 55-year-old moderate stroke risk cohort, lower LACA efficacy rates or stroke risk reduction would be needed for the same ICER thresholds. In patients at low stroke risk, LACA was unlikely to be cost-effective.The use of LACA may be cost-effective in patients with AF at moderate risk for stroke, but it is not cost-effective in low-risk patients. Our threshold analyses may provide a framework for the design of future clinical trials by providing effect size estimates for LACA efficacy needed."

To determine if plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide are elevated in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and to determine the relationship of atrial natriuretic peptide to symptoms and echocardiographic indices of left ventricular structure and diastolic function in these patients. Design. A prospective study in which atrial natriuretic peptide was measured in peripheral venous plasma in 14 patients (age 44 ㊣ 14 years) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 17 healthy controls. Echocardiography was performed in all cases and 30 controls to examine indices of left heart structure and function. All patients underwent clinical evaluation. Results. The concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide was significantly higher in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than controls, (17.86 ㊣ 8.72 vs. 6.22 ㊣ 3.26 pmol/l, P = 0.0001). Diastolic dysfunction was observed in 11 of 14 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. No correlation was demonstrated between atrial natriuretic peptide levels and the degree of diastolic dysfunction, septal or free wall thickness, left atrial size, degree of mitral regurgitation or New York Heart Association functional class. Conclusions. Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide are elevated in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but do not correlate with symptoms or echocardiographically-derived indices of left ventricular structure or diastolic function."

Then we used hydrothermal method to process the electrodeposited Zn coating for in-situ growth of ZnO nanosheets. After low-energy modification with pentadecafluorooctanoic acid, the Zn coating with ZnO nanosheets on the steel substrate became superhydrophobicity, with water contact angle of 158∼ and the sliding angle of about 6∼. The prepared superhydrophobic Zn coating with ZnO nanosheets exhibited good stability and excellent self-cleaning property.

This study assesses the prevalence of both systolic and diastolic LV dysfunction and other cardiac abnormalities in patients with ankylosing spondylitis who have no clinical cardiac manifestations. Fifty-nine patients (49 men and 10 women, mean age 42 ㊣ 10 years) underwent full clinical examination, electrocardiography, 24-hour Holter monitoring and 2-dimensional, M-mode and Doppler echocardiography. Mean disease duration was 17 ㊣ 9 years (range 1 to 42). Seventeen patients had evidence of noncardiac extraarticular manifestations. Precordial examination was normal in all. An age- and sex-matched control group of 44 healthy subjects was also studied.On echocardiography, abnormal LV diastolic function was detected in 12 patients (20%). Prolonged isovolumic relaxation time, prolonged deceleration time, reduced rate of descent of flow velocity in early diastole (EF slope) and reversal of the early and late peak transmitral diastolic flow velocities (EA ratio) were noted in 9 patients. In 3 patients there was an increased EA ratio, reduced deceleration time and increased EF slope. Mild aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation was seen in 1 and 3 patients, respectively. No abnormalities of left atrial size, LV systolic or diastolic dimensions or wall thicknesses were noted. There was no correlation between the presence of LV diastolic dysfunction and age, disease severity, disease duration, or the presence of extraarticular manifestations. It is concluded that LV diastolic dysfunction occurs frequently in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, even in the absence of clinical cardiac involvement."
Rectal injury occurring at radical retropubic prostatectomy for prostate cancer: etiology and treatment,"Robert H. McLaren, David M.

All but one were detected immediately at the time of surgery and were repaired; a temporary diverting colostomy was established in 6 patients. Follow-up on these patients ranged from nine to one hundred eighty-five months (mean, 68 months). Four patients had fistulas between the rectum and the urinary tract that required additional surgery. Factors that predisposed patients for intraoperative injury to the rectum include a history of previous pelvic radiation therapy, previous rectal surgery, and previous transurethral resection of the prostate (P < 0.01). Higher local tumor stage did not significantly increase the risk of rectal injury at the time of radical retropubic prostatectomy. Preoperative bowel preparation may obviate colostomy; it may still be necessary in high-risk patients with suboptimal local repair."
Evaluation of Transsyndesmotic Fixation and Primary Deltoid Ligament Repair in Ankle Fractures With Suspected Combined Deltoid Ligament Injury,"Kai Wu, Jian Lin, Jianhua Huang, Qiugen Wang, ","The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery, Volume 57, Issue 4, July每August 2018, Pages 694-700, ","The present prospective study examined the utility of the intraoperative tap test/technique for distal tibiofibular syndesmosis in the diagnosis of deltoid ligament rupture and compared the outcomes of transsyndesmotic fixation to deltoid ligament repair with suture anchor. This diagnostic technique was performed in 59 ankle fractures with suspected deltoid ligament injury. The width of the medial clear space of 59 cases was evaluated to assess the sensitivity and specificity. Those with deltoid ligament rupture were randomly assigned to 2 groups and treated with deltoid ligament repair with a suture anchor or with syndesmosis screw fixation. All the patients were assessed with the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scale, short-form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36), and visual analog scale (VAS). The tap test was positive in 53 cases. However, surgical exploration demonstrated that 51 cases (86.4%) had a combined deltoid ligament injury and fracture. The sensitivity and specificity of the tap test was 100.0% and 75.0%, respectively. Finally, 26 cases (96.3%) in the syndesmosis screw group and 22 (91.7%) in the deltoid repair group were followed up. No statistically significant differences were found in the AOFAS ankle-hindfoot scale score, SF-36 score, or VAS score between the 2 groups. The malreduction rate in the syndesmosis screw group was 34.6% and that in the deltoid repair group was 9.09%. The tap test is an intraoperative diagnostic method to use to evaluate for deltoid ligament injury. Deltoid ligament repair with a suture anchor had good functional and radiologic outcomes comparable to those with syndesmotic screw fixation but has a lower malreduction rate. We did not encounter the issue of internal fixation failure or implant removal."

"Nonlinear thermomechanical finite-element modeling, analysis and characterization of multi-turn oscillating heat pipes","Hao Peng, P. Frank Pai, Hongbin Ma, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 69, February 2014, Pages 424-437, ","Oscillating heat pipes (OHPs) are promising heat dissipation devices for modern electronic systems due to their high heat transfer rate, simple construction and low manufacturing cost. Despite the unique features of OHPs, how to initiate and sustain the slug flow within the capillary tube and how different parameters affect the performance of an OHP are not well understood. This paper presents an advanced, fully nonlinear thermomechanical finite-element model that can simulate the parametrically excited oscillation of the liquid slug, the temperature distribution along the two-phase flow and the heat transfer performance of OHPs. The model can account for the influences of nonlinear spring effect of vapor slugs, interphase mass-transferring effect, fluid filling ratio, operating temperatures of the evaporator and condenser, different heating modes (top- or bottom-heating), gravity, bending pressure loss, properties of the working fluid, and different random distributions of initial velocities and lengths of fluid slugs. An Euler predictor每corrector method with convergence check is used to solve for the oscillation of and the temperature distribution within each fluid plug. The dynamics of OHPs is characterized using a newly developed time每frequency analysis technique. Numerical results show that an OHP is a parametrically excited nonlinear thermomechanical system. Latent heat transfer provides the driving force for the oscillation, and sensible heat transfer induced by forced convection contributes more than 80% of the total heat transfer rate. Generally speaking, working fluids with high thermal conductivity, low latent heat, and low viscosity are favorable for efficient heat transfer. These results provide better understanding of heat transfer mechanisms of OHPs and can be used for design optimization of OHPs."

HZ-6d targeted HERC5 to regulate p53 ISGylation in human hepatocellular carcinoma,"Yang Wang, Qi Ding, Tao Xu, Chang-yao Li, Lei Zhang, ","Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, Volume 334, 1 November 2017, Pages 180-191, ","Manipulating the posttranslational modulator of p53 is central in the regulation of its activity and function. ISGylated p53 can be degraded by the 20S proteasome. During this process, HERC5/Ceb1, an IFN-induced HECT-type E3 ligase, mediated p53 ISGylation. In this study, we indicated that HERC5 was over-expressed in both HCC tissue samples and cell lines. Knockdown of HERC5 significantly induced the expression of p53, p21 and Bax/Bcl-2 in HCC cells, resulting in apoptosis augment. Whereas, opposite results were obtained by using HERC5 over-expression. On this basis, we screened a 7, 11-disubstituted quinazoline derivative HZ-6d that could bind to the HERC5 G-rich sequence in vitro. Interestingly, HZ-6d injection effectively delayed the growth of xenografts in nude mice. In vitro, HZ-6d significantly inhibited cell growth, suppressed cell migration, induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Further studies demonstrated the anti-cancer effect of HZ-6d was associated with down-regulation of HERC5 and accumulation of p53. Collectively, we demonstrated that HZ6d is a HERC5 G-quadruplex ligand with anti-tumor properties, an action that may offer an attractive idea for restoration of p53 function in cancers."

The effects of L-type amino acid transporter 1 on milk protein synthesis in mammary glands of dairy cows,"Ye Lin, Xiaoyu Duan, He Lv, Yang Yang, Xiaoming Hou, ","Journal of Dairy Science, Volume 101, Issue 2, February 2018, Pages 1687-1696, ","The mammary gland requires the uptake of AA for milk protein synthesis during lactation. The L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1, encoded by SLC7A5), found in many different types of mammalian cells, is indispensable as a transporter of essential AA to maintain cell growth and protein synthesis. However, the function of LAT1 in regulating milk protein synthesis in the mammary gland of the dairy cow remains largely unknown. For the current study, we characterized the relationship between LAT1 expression and milk protein synthesis in lactating dairy cows and investigated whether the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling controls the expression of LAT1 in their mammary glands. We found that LAT1 and the heavy chain of its chaperone, 4F2, were expressed in mammary tissues of lactating cows, with the expression levels of LAT1 and the 4F2 heavy chain being significantly greater in lactating mammary tissues with high-milk protein content (milk yield, 33.8 ㊣ 2.1 kg/d; milk protein concentration >3%, wt/vol,; n = 3) than in tissues from cows with low-milk protein content (milk yield, 33.7 ㊣ 0.5 kg/d; milk protein concentration <3%, wt/vol; n = 3). Immunofluorescence staining of sectioned mammary tissues from cows with high and low milk protein content showed that LAT1 was located on the whole plasma membrane of alveolar epithelial cells, suggesting that LAT1 provides essential AA to the mammary gland. In cultured mammary epithelial cells from the dairy cows with high-milk protein content, knockdown of LAT1 expression decreased cell viability and 汕-casein expression; in contrast, overexpression of LAT1 had the opposite effect. Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin attenuated the phosphorylation of molecules related to mTORC1 signaling and caused a marked decrease in LAT1 expression in the cultured cells; expression of 汕-casein also decreased significantly. These results suggest that LAT1 is involved in milk protein synthesis in the mammary glands of lactating dairy cows and that the mTORC1 signaling pathway might be a control point for regulation of LAT1 expression, which could ultimately be used to alter milk protein synthesis."

Nuclear Domains in Skeletal Myotubes: The Localization of Transferrin Receptor mRNA Is Independent of Its Half-Life and Restricted by Binding to Ribosomes,"Evelyn Ralston, Robert S. McLaren, Jill A. Horowitz, ","Experimental Cell Research, Volume 236, Issue 2, 1 November 1997, Pages 453-462, ","The retention of mRNAs near the nuclei that synthesize them may be an important feature of the organization of multinucleated skeletal myotubes. Here, we assess the possible role of two factors in this localization. First, we examine the role of mRNA half-life, by studying the distribution of the mRNA for the transferrin receptor (TfR), whose half-life can be manipulated in culture by changing the availability of iron.In situhybridization of myotubes of the mouse muscle cell line C2 shows that TfR mRNA is concentrated in the core of the myotubes. Its distribution around the nuclei is often asymmetric and its concentration changes abruptly. Stable transcripts display the same asymmetric localization as unstable ones, suggesting that half-life does not determine subcellular localization of TfR mRNA. Differential effects of the protein synthesis inhibitors puromycin and cycloheximide suggest that the mRNA is retained in position by its association with ribosomes. We then examine the distribution of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and find it to be broader than the distribution of TfR mRNA. In contrast to TfR mRNA, the mRNA for a secreted immunoglobulin 百 light chain has a more uniform distribution. Taken together, the results suggest that TfR mRNA may associate with RER subdomains by specific targeting."

Online tracking of instantaneous frequency and amplitude of dynamical system response,"P.

Teager每Kaiser algorithm (TKA) is a well-known four-point method for online tracking of frequency and amplitude. Because finite difference is used in TKA, its accuracy is easily destroyed by measurement and/or signal-processing noise. Moreover, because TKA assumes the processed signal to be a pure harmonic, any moving average in the signal can destroy the accuracy of TKA. On the other hand, because SWT uses a constant and a pair of windowed regular harmonics to fit the data and estimate the instantaneous frequency and amplitude, the influence of any moving average is eliminated. Moreover, noise filtering is an implicit capability of SWT when more than three data points are used, and this capability increases with the number of processed data points. To compare the accuracy of SWT and TKA, Hilbert每Huang transform is used to extract accurate time-varying frequencies and amplitudes by processing the whole data set without assuming the signal to be harmonic. Frequency and amplitude trackings of different amplitude- and frequency-modulated signals, vibrato in music, and nonlinear stationary and non-stationary dynamic signals are studied. Results show that SWT is more accurate, robust, and versatile than TKA for online tracking of frequency and amplitude."
A marginal analysis guided technology evaluation and selection,"Kim Hua Tan, James Noble, Yuji Sato, Ying Kei Tse, ","International Journal of Production Economics, Volume 131, Issue 1, May 2011, Pages 15-21, ","Making decisions on strategic investments, such as early stage manufacturing technology (MT), is a complicated task. Early stage technologies are usually costly, and surrounded by uncertainty. The potential benefits are often hard to quantify prior to implementation. Thus, how could managers make good decisions in a high-risk, technically complex business when the information they need to make those decisions comes largely from the project champions who are competing against one another for resources? Traditionally, in this problem domain, decisions are made based upon gut-feeling and past experience, sometimes with the support of some multi-criteria decision-support tools. The criteria evaluation process is very subjective and relies heavily on managers＊ experience, knowledge, as well as intuition. Thus, the evaluation approach is often not effectively carried out as there is lack of visibility and traceability in the decision making process. The impact of this scenario is that managers are not confident that resources are being optimised and applied to a mixed portfolio of projects to maximise benefits. This paper proposes a marginal analysis directed branch and bound approach for evaluating and selecting early stage manufacturing technology (MT) projects. A case study is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed approach. Implications of the proposed approach to practitioners and academia are discussed and future research outlined."
Influence of welding sequence on welding deformation and residual stress of a stiffened plate structure,"Zhen Chen, Zhechao Chen, R. Ajit Shenoi, ","Ocean Engineering, Volume 106, 15 September 2015, Pages 271-280, ","An important consideration in the safe and efficient manufacture and operation of marine structures is the possible distortion, and consequential induced residual stress, owing to welding. This paper deals with welding simulation of a stiffened plate structure with longitudinal and transverse stiffeners using a thermal elasto-plastic FE method. Shell elements with section integration features are adopted to model the plate and stiffeners and solid elements to model the local detail of weld line region. Linear constraint equations are established between degrees of freedom of the shell and solid elements. Welding parameters of heat input, welding speed and welding sequence are considered in the analysis. A typical fillet-welded joint is studied and the thermal and mechanical results are compared with experimental values. Six welding sequences are simulated. The results demonstrate the specific influences of the different welding parameters on residual distortion and stress in a stiffened plate structure."
Impact of soil moisture on the long-term energy performance of an earth-air heat exchanger system,"Jian Lin, Hossein Nowamooz, Sandrine Braymand, Patrice Wolff, Christophe Fond, ","Renewable Energy, In press, corrected proof, Available online 2 July 2018, ","The soil moisture contents affect significantly the soil thermal properties and consequently the thermal efficiency of shallow geothermal systems. This effect becomes more complex to be evaluated for an Earth-Air Heat Exchanger (EAHE) because of its non-stable energy performance due to a large fluctuation of the temperature of air. In this study, the impact of soil moisture content and soil thermal properties has been investigated on the long-term energy performance of an instrumented EAHE site. First, a full-scale experimental EAHE site in University of Strasbourg as well as its measured data are presented. The thermal properties of different soil layers present in the site were experimentally and theoretically characterized with different soil moisture contents. Based on these results, an analytical solution was proposed to simulate the soil temperature of the field and the output air temperature of the EAHE. A computer program based on this analytical solution was developed to assess the performance of the system for a period of three years. The numerical calculation was validated for an average saturation condition by comparing simulation results with measured data. Different soil saturation conditions were also used in the numerical simulation to consider the effect of soil moisture on the system performance. The results show that if the turbulent flow of the circulating air is fully developed, the difference of the exchanged energy could reach more than 40%."
Long transient phenomenon in nonlinear structural vibration,"P. Frank Pai, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, Volume 321, Issues 1每2, 20 March 2009, Pages 305-318, ","The long transient phenomenon in nonlinear structural vibrations is examined in detail by using a signal decomposition and processing method based on the empirical mode decomposition, Hilbert每Huang transform (HHT), and nonlinear dynamic characteristics derived from perturbation analysis. A sliding-window fitting (SWF) technique is derived to show the physical implication of Hilbert每Huang transform and other time每frequency decomposition methods. The SWF uses windowed regular harmonics and function orthogonality to simultaneously extract time-localized regular and/or distorted harmonics. Because of the use of pre-determined basis functions, function orthogonality, and windowed curve fitting for component extraction, it cannot extract accurate time-varying frequencies and amplitudes of harmonics distorted by nonlinearities. On the other hand, the HHT uses the apparent time scales revealed by the signal's local maxima and minima to sequentially sift distorted harmonics of different time scales, starting from high-frequency to low-frequency ones. Because Hilbert每Huang transform does not use predetermined basis functions and function orthogonality for component extraction, it provides more accurate signal decomposition and instant amplitudes and frequencies of extracted distorted harmonics. Numerical results show that the proposed HHT-based signal decomposition and processing method can accurately decompose nonlinear nonstationary signals and extract accurate intrawave amplitude and phase modulations, distorted harmonic response under a single-frequency harmonic excitation, and different types and orders of nonlinearities. Using this signal processing method, the long transient phenomenon in nonlinear vibrations is found to be caused by nonlinearities, coupling of transient and forced vibrations, and/or modal coupling of multiple modes."
28: Nutritional Needs and Support for the Burned Patient,"Joshua S. Carson, Houman Khosrozadeh, William B. Norbury, David N. Herndon, ","Total Burn Care (Fifth Edition), 2018, Pages 287-300.e2, ","Burns involving more than 20% of the total body surface area represent a massive metabolic injury. This metabolic response to massive burns creates an immediate, intense, and persistent strain on the patient's nutritional status. The systemic response to burn injury alters essentially all aspects of energy-substrate metabolism. Given the immense metabolic challenges created by burn injury, optimizing nutritional support is essential to improving outcomes in this patient population. Total calories provided should be based on ongoing assessment of energy expenditure, ideally using indirect calorimetry. Providing calories in excess of the patient's needs (i.e., overfeeding) is counterproductive. Enteral nutrition is the first line of nutritional support in the burn patient, and enteral feeding should be administered as soon as possible. Accurate serial assessment of nutritional status and body composition is central to identifying patient needs, trajectory, and efficacy of care. Changes in lean body mass and body composition represent the ultimate reflection of cumulative nutritional status, and evolving applications of imaging technology have made routine serial evaluation of lean body mass feasible. The physiologic response to massive thermal injury represents an enormous nutritional insult. The consequences of this intense acute malnutrition include compromises in immune function, wound healing, and mobility〞all major drivers of morbidity and mortality in thermal trauma. As such, thoughtful and comprehensive nutritional support based on continuous assessment is essential."

Semantic-free scaling of odor quality,"David A. Stevens, Robert J. O'Connell, ","Physiology & Behavior, Volume 60, Issue 1, July 1996, Pages 211-215, ","The validity of the odor quality reports given by naive human subjects is often questionable. On the one hand, social conventions can influence the labeling of odorants, especially those that have putrid or uncommon odor qualities, and on the other, semantic differences exist for odor descriptors among individuals. We are interested in the individual differences in the quality reports elicited by two nominally putrid odorants, androstenone (AND) and pemenone (PEM). Here we sought to establish empirical support for the individual differences previously obtained in studies of their odor quality, using a nonverbal, semantic-free method of classification. Undergraduate volunteers sniffed a moderate concentration (390 米M) of PEM, rated its intensity, and provided a verbal odor descriptor. The subjects were then classified as PEM osmic (n = 42) if the quality report was putrid (rancid, urinous, sweaty), allosmic (n = 23), if the quality was nonputrid, and anosmic (n = 39) if no odor was detected. The subjects then sorted 15 odorants matched for intensity, five selected from each of three nominal odor quality types, into as many odor groups as they wished, as long as each group contained all of the compounds with similar odors. The number of times each odorant was paired with another was used as data for an independent multidimensional scaling with ALSCAL, for each class of subject. Three-dimensional solutions showed that this nonverbal, semantic-free scaling method produced odor classifications consistent with those found when each class of subject reported odor qualities from a defined list of quality descriptors. Cluster analysis of the MDS coordinates revealed that these solutions also retained the individual odor quality differences thought to be characteristic of osmic, allosmic and anosmic subjects."

Effects of bend-twist coupling on flutter limits of composite wind turbine blades,"Xiandong Zhou, Kefu Huang, Zheng Li, ","Composite Structures, Volume 192, 15 May 2018, Pages 317-326, ","The effects of bend-twist coupling on the flutter limits of large composite wind turbine blades are investigated in this work. A mixed, geometrically exact, and nonlinear finite element for anisotropic beams is developed based on Hellinger-Reissner variational principle. The nonlinear beam model is combined with Blade Element Momentum method and an unsteady dynamic stall model to perform flutter analysis of composite blades. A 5-MW composite wind turbine blade with shallow-angled skins is studied, where unbalanced laminates (i.e. ply angle and ply thickness unbalances) are implemented to introduce the bend-twist coupling in the blade through material anisotropy. The results show that with bend-twist coupling due to geometrical nonlinearities, the predicted flutter limits are around 23% lower than the same predicted in linear flutter analysis. The unbalanced skin laminates show no significant influence on the flutter limits of the blade in nonlinear flutter analysis."

Ribosome Association Contributes to Restricting mRNAs to the Cell Body of Hippocampal Neurons,"Zhuomei Lu, Robert S. McLaren, Christine A. Winters, Evelyn Ralston, ","Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience, Volume 12, Issue 6, December 1998, Pages 363-375, ","In neurons, mRNAs are differentially sorted to axons, dendrites, and the cell body. Recently, regions of certain mRNAs have been identified that target those mRNAs for translocation to the processes. However, the mechanism by which many, if not most mRNAs are retained in the cell body is not understood. Total inhibition of translation, by puromycin or cycloheximide, results in the mislocalization of cell body mRNAs to dendrites. We have examined the effect of translational inhibitors on the localization of ferritin mRNA, the translation of which can also be inhibited specifically by reducing iron levels. Using nonisotopicin situhybridization, ferritin mRNA is found restricted to the cell body of cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Following treatment with either puromycin or cycloheximide, it migrates into dendrites. Control experiments reveal that the drugs affect neither the viability of the neuronal cultures, nor the steady-state level of ferritin mRNA. When transcription and protein synthesis are inhibited simultaneously, ferritin mRNA is found in the dendrites of puromycin, but not of cycloheximide-treated neurons. However, the localization of ferritin mRNA is unaffected by changes in iron concentration that regulate its translation rate specifically. We propose a model whereby cell body-restricted mRNAs are maintained in that location by association with ribosomes and with another cell component, which traps mRNAs when they are freed of ribosome association. The release of all mRNA species, as happens after total protein synthesis inhibition, floods the system and allows cell body mRNAs to diffuse into dendrites. In contrast, the partial release of the single ferritin mRNA species does not saturate the trapping system and the mRNA is retained in the cell body."

Long-duration metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasties with low wear of the articulating surfaces,"Thomas P. Schmalzried, Paul C. Peters, Brian T. Maurer, Charles R. Bragdon, William H. Harris, ","The Journal of Arthroplasty, Volume 11, Issue 3, April 1996, Pages 322-331, ","The 20-year performance of metal-on-metal hip articulations has not been reported. Five McKee〞Farrar total hip prostheses and one Sivash prosthesis were obtained at revision surgery after a mean implantation time of 21.3 years. A radiographic, histologic, implant, and wear analysis was performed on these total hip implants with cobalt〞chrome metal-on-metal articulations. All cases were associated with femoral component loosening, but the bearing surfaces performed remarkably well. The worst case estimate of combined femoral and acetabular linear wear was 4.2 米m per year, about 25 times less than that typically seen with polyethylene. Metal particles and foreign-body inflammation were seen in all cases, but the volume of reactive tissue was small compared with what is generally seen at revision of hips with a polyethylene acetabular bearing. This may be due to a reduced particle burden or a decreased inflammatory reaction to particulate metal, or both. In addition to articular wear, other sources of metal particles included femoral neck impingement on the acetabular rim, stem burnishing, and corrosion. Prosthetic hip reconstructions can fail for many reasons, including suboptimal femoral stem and/or acetabular cup design and/or fixation. By today's standards, the McKee〞Farrar and Sivash stem and acetabular component designs are suboptimal; however, after more than 20 years of use, the metal-on-metal bearing surfaces in these cases demonstrated low wear and do not appear to be the cause of failure. Recent advances in total hip arthroplasty, which include improved implant design, materials, manufacturing, and fixation, combined with a better understanding of the mechanisms of implant loosening and failure, suggest that the cobalt〞chrome metal-on-metal bearing be reexamined as an alternative to polyethylene when exceptional durability is required."
Investigation of the relationship between infrared structure and pyrolysis reactivity of coals with different ranks,"Xing Xie, Yan Zhao, Penghua Qiu, Dan Lin, Jiangtao Pei, ","Fuel, Volume 216, 15 March 2018, Pages 521-530, ","The chemical structures of six coal samples with different ranks were semi-quantitatively characterized by a series of original infrared structural parameters, and the pyrolysis reactivity of the samples were quantitatively characterized by a comprehensive devolatilization index. A correlation was established between the infrared structural parameters and pyrolysis reactivity. The results show that the infrared structural parameter method presented in this paper can reveal the distribution characteristic of chemical bonds in coal effectively. The total content of oxygen-containing functional groups, CH groups and the inorganic mineral can be satisfactorily characterized by infrared structural parameter, Ia3, Ib4 and Id3 respectively. The length of aliphatic side chains or bridge bonds undergoes a Stable-Increased-Decreased process. Good positive correlation was established between the comprehensive infrared structural parameter S and the pyrolysis reactivity, which was proved effective to predict the pyrolysis reactivity of coal over various ranks."
Optogenetic Editing Reveals the Hierarchical Organization of Learned Action Sequences,"Claire E. Geddes, Hao Li, Xin Jin, ","Cell, Volume 174, Issue 1, 28 June 2018, Pages 32-43.e15, ","The organization of action into sequences underlies complex behaviors that are essential for organismal survival and reproduction. Despite extensive studies of innate sequences in relation to central pattern generators, how learned action sequences are controlled and whether they are organized as a chain or a hierarchy remain largely unknown. By training mice to perform heterogeneous action sequences, we demonstrate that striatal direct and indirect pathways preferentially encode different behavioral levels of sequence structure. State-dependent closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of the striatal direct pathway can selectively insert a single action element into the sequence without disrupting the overall sequence length. Optogenetic manipulation of the striatal indirect pathway completely removes the ongoing subsequence while leaving the following subsequence to be executed with the appropriate timing and length. These results suggest that learned action sequences are not organized in a serial but rather a hierarchical structure that is distinctly controlled by basal ganglia pathways.Download high-res image (110KB)Download full-size image"

None of the remaining measures in a battery of standard cognitive indices, including Stanford-Binet MA, was associated with reading achievement. The results of cross-lagged correlation analysis of data from one of the two samples suggested that individual differences in time to access name codes for visual stimuli predict, but are not a consequence of, individual differences in reading achievement. The results of the cross-lagged analysis for the second sample were inconclusive. As a whole, the results are consistent with findings from other populations indicating that both short term memory span and efficiency of retrieval from long term memory are related to reading ability. The results also indicate, however, that the relationship between retrieval efficiency and reading achievement in precocious readers cannot be described by extrapolation of threshold estimates from the performance of older, unselected groups of readers."
Exclusion requirements and potential concurrency for composite objects,"Abdelsalam Shanneb, John Potter, James Noble, ","Science of Computer Programming, Volume 58, Issue 3, December 2005, Pages 344-365, ","Concurrent object-oriented systems must prevent the interference that may arise when multiple threads simultaneously access shared components. We present a simple approach for implementing flexible locking strategies in an object-oriented system, in which the components themselves may be composite objects. We express exclusion requirements as sets of conflict pairs on component interfaces. Given knowledge of the dependency between the interface of a composite object and its internal components, we show how external exclusion requirements can be calculated from internal requirements, and further, how any potential concurrent activity outside an object can be projected into potential concurrency for the internal components.With our approach we can defer the distribution of locks in the system until deployment: the placement of locks and choice of lock type for a component can depend on its operating environment. A Galois connection between the outward mapping of exclusion requirements, and the inward mapping of potential concurrency, limits how many locks are worth considering. In this paper we only deal with exclusion control, including mutexes, read每write locks and read每write sets, and do not cover state-dependent locking or transaction-based approaches."

Superadiabatic radiant porous burner with preheater and radiation corridors,"Vahid Vandadi, Chanwoo Park, Massoud Kaviany, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 64, September 2013, Pages 680-688, ","The current efficiency of monolithic (including two-layer) radiant porous burners is less than 25% and here we introduce a novel structure for effective preheating and radiation routing to increase the efficiency. This recovers the flue gas heat to increase the inlet air temperature and raises the flame temperature locally above the adiabatic temperature (superadiabatic flame) for the fuel-lean conditions. The heat from the superadiabatic region is then extracted and conducted through embedded, high-thermal conductivity radiation corridors and is radiated, at a higher temperature than the flue gas, to the target. The analyses of local thermal non-equilibrium among the gas phase, two-layer porous solid, preheating heat exchanger, and radiant corridor are presented for the zeroth-order reaction of premixed methane/air.

Instantaneous frequency of an arbitrary signal,"P. Frank Pai, ","International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, Volume 52, Issue 12, December 2010, Pages 1682-1693, ","This paper defines the non-negative pointwise instantaneous frequency (pIF) and pointwise instantaneous amplitude (pIA) of an arbitrary time signal to be the circular frequency and radius of curvature of the signal＊s instantaneous trajectory on the complex plane consisting of the signal and its conjugate part from the Hilbert transform. One analytical and three computational methods are derived to prove and validate this concept. The analytical method is derived based on the definition of pIF and circle fitting. A five-point frequency tracking method is developed to eliminate the incapability of the original four-point Teager每Kaiser algorithm (TKA) for obtaining pIF of signals with moving averages. A three-point conjugate-pair decomposition (CPD) method is derived based on circle fitting using a pair of conjugate harmonic functions for frequency tracking. Moreover, the Hilbert每Huang transform (HHT) uses the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to sift a signal＊s instantaneous dynamic component from its sectional moving average (sMA) as the first intrinsic mode function, and then Hilbert transform is used to compute the first IMF＊s frequency and amplitude as the sectional instantaneous frequency (sIF) and sectional instantaneous amplitude (sIA). Because finite difference is used in the five-point TKA, its accuracy is easily destroyed by noise. On the other hand, because CPD uses a constant and a pair of windowed regular harmonics to fit data points and estimate pIF and pIA, noise filtering is an implicit capability of CPD and its accuracy increases with the number of processed data points. Numerical simulations confirm that pIF and pIA are non-negative and physically meaningful and can be used for frequency tracking and accurate characterization of complex signals. However, sIF and sIA from HHT are more useful for system identification because the IMFs sifted by EMD often correspond to actual vibration modes."

Five MRA sequences were obtained in an hour-long examination optimized for aortoiliac, splanchnic, and renal artery imaging at 1.5 T in a body coil. Four of the sequences were performed during or after infusion of gadolinium to improve image quality.Results: MRA correctly defined the maximum aneurysm diameter, as well as its proximal and distal extent in all patients. MRA detected 33 of 35 significant stenoses among 153 splanchnic, renal, or iliac branches examined (sensitivity = 94% and specificity = 98%). MRA did not resolve the degree of aortic branch stenotic disease sufficiently to precisely grade its severity. MRA did not reliably define the status of the inferior mesenteric artery, lumbar arteries or internal iliac arteries. One ruptured AAA and one inflammatory AAA were correctly diagnosed by MRA. No patient had a contrast reaction or contrast-induced renal toxicity related to administration of gadolinium.Conclusion: Gadolinium-enhanced MRA of AAA provides appropriate, essential anatomic information for aortic reconstructive surgery in a 1-hour examination devoid of contrast-related renal toxicity or catheterization-related complications attending conventional arteriography.

A minor (10%) reduction in specialty training would slow specialty growth over the next decade, followed by a slight reduction in supply. Services provided chiefly involve ambulatory reproductive health care, pregnancy, and surgical correction of conditions specific to the female genitourinary system. Even though the proportion of deliveries performed by midwives has increased and family practitioners have maintained their share, obstetrician-gynecologists provide the vast majority of obstetric care and virtually all services for perinatal complications. Generalist services represent relatively minor aspects of their practices. Care of the aged female population is highly fragmented among specialties; more than 50% of all aged Medicare beneficiaries who saw an obstetrician-gynecologist at least once failed to receive a majority of services from any one physician specialty.Conclusion: On the basis of trends in patient demographics and care patterns, obstetrician-gynecologists must resolve whether to provide more generalist office-based care, especially to the rapidly growing older female population, or to invest more intensively in surgical specialty care. The specialty＊s unique contributions to women＊s health should influence this decision."
Effect of pCPA on nicotine-induced analgesia,"Jo E. Cooley, Gregory A. Villarosa, Thomas W. Lombardo, Robert A. Moss, Susan Sult, ","Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior, Volume 36, Issue 2, June 1990, Pages 413-415, ","This study investigated the effect of para-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), on nicotine-induced analgesia. pCPA reduces physiological levels of 5-HT, a neurotransmitter that has been linked to pain. The effects of naloxone HCl and mecamylamine HCl on this analgesia were also assessed. Subjects were 24 albino rats. Each group of eight rats was injected subcutaneously (SC) with nicotine sulphate, followed by an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of one of the potential antagonists. Behavioral analgesia was assessed using the tail-flick test. Data analysis revealed that pCPA did not affect nicotine-induced analgesia. Consistent with past research, naloxone also had no effect, and mecamylamine effectively eliminated this analgesia. The results are interpreted in light of current knowledge of this behavioral analgesia and pain perception, in general."
An extended edge-based smoothed discrete shear gap method for free vibration analysis of cracked Reissner每Mindlin plate,"Gang Yang, Dean Hu, Xu Han, Guowei Ma, ","Applied Mathematical Modelling, Volume 51, November 2017, Pages 477-504, ","An extended edge-based smoothed discrete shear gap method (XES-DSG3) is proposed for free vibration analysis of cracked Reissner每Mindlin plate by implementing the edge-based strain smoothing operation into the discrete shear gap-based extended finiteelement method (XFEM-DSG3). In present method, the strain smoothing operation is implemented into the bending strain gradient matrices, in which the enriched functions are included. Then, the derivatives of element shape functions and derivatives of crack-tip singular enriched functions are not required in the computation. The calculation of element matrices is performed over the smoothing domains which are associated with edges of elements. The transverse shear locking of Reissner每Mindlin plate can be avoided by using the integration of discrete shear gap (DSG) method. Several numerical examples are investigated to illustrate the accuracy of XES-DSG3 for the free vibration analysis of cracked Reissner每Mindlin plate. Moreover, numerical results show that the present method is insensitive to mesh distortion and it is more stable than the pervious XFEM-DSG3."
Shape from fractal geometry,"Susan S. Chen, James M. Keller, Richard M. Crownover, ","Artificial Intelligence, Volume 43, Issue 2, May 1990, Pages 199-218, ","A novel method for the recovery of a planar surface orientation from its image using fractal measures is presented. A fractal-related feature, the average Holder constant, is defined in the two-dimensional topological space. It is proven that the average Holder constant is scale-sensitive and the distance ratio from any two points on the fractal surface to the viewer can be calculated from their average Holder constants. By incorporating the distance ratio into the surface-vanishing line formula in the geometric model, a method for inferring planar surface shape is derived. The novelty of this method is that the fractal-related feature is used as a direct input in the shape recovery process. Experimental results showing the validity of applying this method to artificially rotated textured images and images of naturally textured surfaces are presented."
Fetal exposure to an intra-amniotic inflammation and the development of cerebral palsy at the age of three years,"Bo Hyun Yoon, Roberto Romero, Joong Shin Park, Chong Jai Kim, Tai Ryoon Han, ","American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Volume 182, Issue 3, March 2000, Pages 675-681, ","Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether fetal exposure to intra-amniotic inflammation and a systemic fetal inflammatory response (funisitis) are associated with the development of cerebral palsy at the age of 3 years. Study Design: This cohort study included 123 preterm singleton newborns (gestational age at birth, ≒35 weeks) born to mothers who underwent amniocentesis and were followed up for ≡3 years. The presence of intra-amniotic inflammation was determined by elevated amniotic fluid concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins 6 and 8 and by amniotic fluid white blood cell count. Cytokine concentrations were measured with sensitive and specific immunoassays. Funisitis was diagnosed in the presence of neutrophil infiltration into the umbilical vessel walls or Wharton jelly. Cerebral palsy was diagnosed by neurologic examination at the age of 3 years. Results: Newborns with subsequent development of cerebral palsy had a higher rate of funisitis and were born to mothers with higher median concentrations of interleukins 6 and 8 and higher white blood cell counts in the amniotic fluid compared with newborns without subsequent development of cerebral palsy (funisitis: 75% [9/12] vs 23% [24/105]; interleukin 6: median, 18.9 ng/mL; range, 0.02-92.5 ng/mL; vs median, 1.0 ng/mL; range, 0.01-115.2 ng/mL; interleukin 8: median, 13.0 ng/mL; range, 0.1-294.5 ng/mL; vs median, 1.2 ng/mL; range, 0.05-285.0 ng/mL; white blood cell count: median, 198 cells/mm3; range, 0->1000 cells/mm3; vs median, 3 cells/mm3; range, 0-19,764 cells/mm3; P <.01 for each). After adjustment for the gestational age at birth, the presence of funisitis and elevated concentrations of interleukins 6 and 8 in amniotic fluid significantly increased the odds of development of cerebral palsy (funisitis: odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-24.5; interleukin 6: odds ratio, 6.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-33.0; interleukin 8: odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-30.7; P <.05 for each). Conclusion: Antenatal exposure to intra-amniotic inflammation and evidence of a systemic fetal inflammatory response (funisitis) are strong and independent risk factors for the subsequent development of cerebral palsy at the age of 3 years.

Firstly, initial judgment is tried by onsite maintainer; otherwise rule-based fuzzy semantic inference is proposed on the designed IETM platform for rapid diagnosis using portable maintenance aid (PMA). For condition monitoring subsystems, signals can be collected and download to ground station via PMA for enhanced diagnosis using advanced classifiers and data fusion techniques. The combined diagnostic strategies are employed to trigger maintenance guidance and relevant works such as spare parts management etc. The proposed scheme was evaluated by two experiments of fault diagnosis for electric multiple units (EMU) trains. Experiment results show that intelligent, convenient, accurate and flexible diagnosis advantages can be obtained, which are benefit to maintenance reality."
Time每frequency characterization of nonlinear normal modes and challenges in nonlinearity identification of dynamical systems,"P. Frank Pai, ","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, Volume 25, Issue 7, October 2011, Pages 2358-2374, ","Presented here is a new time每frequency signal processing methodology based on Hilbert每Huang transform (HHT) and a new conjugate-pair decomposition (CPD) method for characterization of nonlinear normal modes and parametric identification of nonlinear multiple-degree-of-freedom dynamical systems. Different from short-time Fourier transform and wavelet transform, HHT uses the apparent time scales revealed by the signal's local maxima and minima to sequentially sift components of different time scales. Because HHT does not use pre-determined basis functions and function orthogonality for component extraction, it provides more accurate time-varying amplitudes and frequencies of extracted components for accurate estimation of system characteristics and nonlinearities. CPD uses adaptive local harmonics and function orthogonality to extract and track time-localized nonlinearity-distorted harmonics without the end effect that destroys the accuracy of HHT at the two data ends. For parametric identification, the method only needs to process one steady-state response (a free undamped modal vibration or a steady-state response to a harmonic excitation) and uses amplitude-dependent dynamic characteristics derived from perturbation analysis to determine the type and order of nonlinearity and system parameters. A nonlinear two-degree-of-freedom system is used to illustrate the concepts and characterization of nonlinear normal modes, vibration localization, and nonlinear modal coupling. Numerical simulations show that the proposed method can provide accurate time每frequency characterization of nonlinear normal modes and parametric identification of nonlinear dynamical systems. Moreover, results show that nonlinear modal coupling makes it impossible to decompose a general nonlinear response of a highly nonlinear system into nonlinear normal modes even if nonlinear normal modes exist in the system."

Late Pleistocene loess-like deposits in the coastal area of south China,"Jing Wang, Zhen Chen, Quanzhou Gao, Rodney Grapes, Guoneng Chen, ","CATENA, Volume 167, August 2018, Pages 305-318, ","A layer of yellow silt with thickness from tens of centimeters to a few meters is widely distributed on low hills and terraces in the coastal area of south China. The yellow silt has different sedimentological characteristics from other common types of Quaternary sediments and the bedrock weathering material in the area. Five representative sections were studied using scanning electron microscopy, grain size analysis, diffuse reflection spectroscopy, geochemical analysis and optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating to reveal the sedimentary characteristics, deposition environment, origin and age of the yellow silt. Subrounded-subangular quartz grains showed typical aeolian impact pits, such as dish-like and crescent pits, and chemical precipitation and corrosion on grain surfaces. The grain size composition, grain size parameters and unimodal frequency distribution curves of the yellow silt were similar in all sections examined and consistent with those of north and central China loess. The iron mineral content of the yellow silt was dominated by hematite, indicating a similar sedimentary environment to that of typical Chinese loess. The major oxide composition of the yellow silt with respect to normalized upper continental crust (UCC) distribution patterns was close to that of the UCC and similar to north China loess and other aeolian deposits in China. However, the data suggested that the yellow silt in the coastal area of south China had suffered strong weathering after deposition. The OSL ages of the yellow silt indicated a deposition age of late Pleistocene. The results of the various analytical methods all showed an origin correlation and regular transition of loess deposits from northwest to southeast China. Hence, it was concluded that the yellow silt widely distributed in the coastal area of south China is a loess-like deposit formed during the late Pleistocene. It probably mostly originated from northwest inland China and constitutes the south extension of other loess in China."

A backtracking search hyper-heuristic for the distributed assembly flow-shop scheduling problem,"Jian Lin, Zhou-Jing Wang, Xiaodong Li, ","Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, Volume 36, October 2017, Pages 124-135, ","Distributed assembly permutation flow-shop scheduling problem (DAPFSP) is recognized as an important class of problems in modern supply chains and manufacturing systems. In this paper, a backtracking search hyper-heuristic (BS-HH) algorithm is proposed to solve the DAPFSP.

Additionally, an efficient solution encoding and decoding scheme is proposed to generate a feasible schedule. The effectiveness of the BS-HH is evaluated on two typical benchmark sets and the computational results indicate the superiority of the proposed BS-HH scheme over the state-of-the-art algorithms."

Cetuximab therapy in head and neck cancer: Immune modulation with interleukin-12 and other natural killer cell每activating cytokines,"Eric Luedke, Alena Cristina Jaime-Ramirez, Neela Bhave, Julie Roda, William E. Carson, ","Surgery, Volume 152, Issue 3, September 2012, Pages 431-440, ","Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Greater than 90% of SCCHN of the oropharynx overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or HER1). Cetuximab (Erbitux-TM) is a humanized anti-HER1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to HER1 overexpressing tumor cells. Cetuximab has a direct effect on HER1-positive cancer cells, but it also can activate immune cells that bear receptors for the Fc (constant portion) of IgG such as natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells have an activating Fc receptor for IgG (Fc污RIIIa), which mediates Ab dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and enhances production of interferon-污 (IFN-污) in response to Ab-coated targets. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a cytokine produced by antigen-presenting cells that stimulates IFN-污 production from NK cells. We hypothesized that IL-12 would enhance the anti-tumor activity of cetuximab by activating the FcR effector mechanisms of NK cells.Expression of HER1 was measured on human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive (UD-SCC2, UM-SCC47) and HPV-negative (Cal27, UM-SCC74B) SCCHN cell lines by immunoblot analysis and flow cytometry. NK cells from normal donors were treated overnight with IL-2 (100 U), IL-12, IL-15, or IL-21 (all 10 ng/mL) and tested for ADCC versus cetuximab-coated cancer cells in a 4 hr 51Cr assay. Release of cytokines by NK cells in response to cetuximab-coated cells was measured by ELISA. Phosphorylation of the ERK transcription factor in NK cells was measured by flow cytometry. The efficacy of combination therapy with cetuximab plus IL-12 was evaluated in a murine tumor model of head and neck cancer.All cell lines showed >99% expression of HER1 by flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis except UM-SCC74B (73%). Normal NK cells mediated 49.4% lysis of cetuximab-coated SCCHN cell lines as compared to 7.6% lysis of cells treated with control IgG (P = .0002). NK cell lysis of cetuximab-coated SCCHN cells was markedly enhanced by 12 hr pre-treatment of NK cells with IL-12 (71.6% lysis, P = .005 vs cetuximab alone). As a control, IL-12-activated NK cells were tested against IgG-treated cells. ADCC under these conditions was just 21.7%. Similar levels of lysis were noted for both HPV-positive and HPV-negative and cell lines. Other NK cell activating factors such as IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21 were also able to enhance NK cell ADCC. The stimulus of IL-12 and cetuximab-coated tumor cells induced the synergistic production of nanogram levels of IFN-污 (>6-fold increase over controls) (P < .001). A similar effect was seen for NK cell production of the chemokines RANTES, MIP-1汐, and IL-8. Phosphorylation of ERK (which is critical for FcR-mediated ADCC and cytokine production) was enhanced in NK cells exposed to IL-12 and IgG as compared to control conditions. The combination of cetuximab plus IL-12 resulted in a reduction in tumor burden when compared to either agent alone in a murine xenograft model of SCCHN.Cytokine stimulation of NK cells in the presence of cetuximab-coated head and neck cancer cells leads to enhanced NK cell mediated ADCC and cytokine secretion independent of tumor cell HPV-status. Cytokine administration could be a useful adjuvant in the cetuximab treatment of HER1-positive head and neck cancer."
Feeding by penaeid prawns: the role of the anterior mouthparts,"Marina J. Hunt, Heather Winsor, C. G. Alexander, ","Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, Volume 160, Issue 1, 23 September 1992, Pages 33-46, ","Penaeid prawns can feed micro- and macrophagously. During ingestion food secured by the pereiopods and maxillipeds III and II is manoeuvered into the oesophagus by the co-ordinated action of maxillipeds I, maxillae II and I, the paragnaths, mandibles and labrum. Prey items >5.00 mm2 are pushed directly between the mandibles by the strongly hooked setae on the basipodites of maxillae I, while particulate food (8每20 米m in diameter) is pushed between the bases of the paragnaths by specialised brush like setae on the coxopodites of maxillae I. In both processes, all materials transferred to the mouth is entangled in secretions from the rosette glands of the paragnaths, resulting in a coherent bolus of material which is passed into the oesophagus by the posterior feeding process of the labrum. Direct examination of these processes and statistical analysis of their movements shows a strong correlation between movements of maxillae I, the paragnaths and labrum. Mandibular movements however, appear independent of these, suggesting that although penaeid prawns prefer to feed macrophagously they can efficiently ingest particulate food without the need of mandibular occlusion and undue energy expenditure."
Chapter 10. Agents Affecting Gastrointestinal Functions,"William A. Bolhofer, Henry I. Jacoby, ","Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, Volume 2, 1967, Pages 91-101, ","Study of chemical substances that inhibit gastric secretion are concerned mainly with gastrin and its synthetic derivatives, secretin, histamine, 2-deoxyglucose, and insulin. Although stimulation of secretion is not a major objective of medicinal chemistry, knowledge of the mode of action of stimulators and physiological conditions inducing secretion could be of value in the design of inhibitors. This chapter includes appropriate papers on secretion stimulation and mechanism. The patterns of electrolyte and acid secretion resulting from gastrin stimulation in man are found to be very similar to the patterns following histamine stimulation. Secretion of intrinsic factor in man is stimulated by gastrin II. The stimulation of gastric secretion by insulin and 2-deoxyglucose and the mechanism of their action have received increased attention. In pylorus-ligated rats, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) (600 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously evoked maximum stimulation. By the same route of administration in chronic fistula rats, the gastric response is all or none and the threshold dose is approximately 50 m/kg. Atropine abolished the gastric response to 2DG in these rats. The stimulatory effect of 2DG on dogs with gastric fistulas is completely eliminated by vagotomy. However, 2DG and insulin, both stimulated secretion in a Heidenhain (denervated) pouch in dogs also having an open gastric fistula (innervated). Inhibition of secretion in a Heidenhain pouch by insulin may be because of liberation of glucagon."

Neural network implementation of fuzzy logic,"James M. Keller, Ronald R. Yager, Hossein Tahani, ","Fuzzy Sets and Systems, Volume 45, Issue 1, 10 January 1992, Pages 1-12, ","Fuzzy logic has gained increased attention as a methodology for managing uncertainty in a rule-based structure. In a fuzzy logic inference system, more rules can fire at any given time than in a crisp expert system. Since the propositions are modelled as possibility distributions, there is a considerable computation load on the inference engine. In this paper, a neural network structure is proposed as a means of performing fuzzy logic inference. Three variations of the network are described, but in each case, the knowledge of the rule (i.e., the antecedent and consequent clauses) are explicitly encoded in the weights of the net. The theoretical properties of this structure are developed. In fact, the network reduces to crisp modus ponens when the inputs are crisp sets. Also, under suitable conditions the degree of specificity of the consequences of the inference is a monotone function of the degree of specificity of the input. Several simulation studies are included to illustrate the performance of the fuzzy logic inference networks."

"Ascorbic acid production in root, nodule and Enterobacter spp. (Gammaproteobacteria) isolated from root nodule of the legume Abrus precatorius L.","Pallab Kumar Ghosh, Tarun Kumar De, Tushar Kanti Maiti, ","Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology, Volume 4, Issue 2, April 2015, Pages 127-134, ","l-ascorbic acid is an antioxidant and plays a significant role to protect against activated form of O2 for N2 fixation in root nodules of legume plants. The root nodules of Abrus precatorius L. is found to contain higher amount of ascorbic acid, ascorbate peroxidase (EC1.11.1.11) and glucose than non-nodulated roots that are beneficial for nodule function. Two ascorbic acid producing symbiotic bacterial strains (A3CK and A7CK) were isolated from nodules of this plant and identified as Enterobacter spp. (Gammaproteobacteria) based on phenotypic characteristics and 16S rDNA sequence based molecular phylogenetic approach. The host may contribute part of nodular ascorbic acid and another part might be produced by Enterobacter spp., which plays important roles particularly facilitating root infection for nodulation, N2 fixation and delay nodule senescence. The host plant may induce the symbiont to produce ascorbic acid when necessary, which was confirmed by the ascorbic acid production ability of the symbionts in culture. The production of ascorbic acid by the symbiont increased largely when the Yeast Extract Mannitol medium was supplemented with fructose and ammonium sulfate in culture as carbon and nitrogen source. The symbionts also have some plant growth promoting traits viz. IAA production, N2 fixation, ACC deaminase activity etc. Few legume plants are reported where Gammaproteobacteria are found in root nodules. A. precatorius is another legume plant reported here where Gammaproteobacteria are found in root nodule and they possess the ability to produce ascorbic acid with some other PGPR traits beneficial for nodule function and plant growth promotion."

Frick, ","Journal of Surgical Education, Volume 75, Issue 4, July每August 2018, Pages 901-906, ","To evaluate the distribution of conditions presented at a case conference to assess resident educational exposure to acute pediatric orthopedic conditions.Retrospective review of emergency department and inpatient consultations presented at a daily pediatric orthopedic case conference over a 3-year period. Consultations were divided into 3-month resident rotation blocks for analysis.Tertiary children＊s hospital in the southern United States which host residents from 2 orthopedic surgery residency programs.The case conference is attended by pediatric orthopedic surgeons, 1 pediatric orthopedic fellow, and 4 PGY III/IV residents.A total of 1762 consultations were presented at the conference. The consultations were obtained for traumatic injuries, 86.5% (1524/1762); infections, 7.7% (136/1762); and congenital/other problems, 5.8% (102/1762). The 3 most common consultations per rotation were fractures: both-bone forearm (mean, 46.1; range: 24-64), supracondylar humerus (mean, 23.8; range: 17-31), and distal radius (mean, 13.8; range: 7-33). Less common consultations per rotation were septic arthritis (mean, 1.6; range: 0-5), child abuse (mean, 1.3; range: 0-5), Monteggia fracture (mean, 0.3; range: 0-1), compartment syndrome (mean, 0.2; range: 0-1) and patella sleeve fracture (mean, 0.1; range: 0-1).There was a large disparity between conditions in the number of times presented and reviewed within a 3-month rotation at the daily case conference, with some important conditions not being discussed at all in each rotation. This finding documents a disadvantage of case conferences based on limiting discussion to current patients, and highlights an opportunity for educational improvement."
Photocatalytic performance of different exposed crystal facets of BiOCl,"Hao Li, Lizhi Zhang, ","Current Opinion in Green and Sustainable Chemistry, Volume 6, August 2017, Pages 48-56, ","Bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) is a typical V每VI每VII ternary oxide material of low toxicity and high earth abundance nature. The past ten years have witnessed tremendous efforts in utilizing BiOCl as a versatile catalysts for photocatalytic applications, including pollutant removal, water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation and organic transformation. Remarkably, photocatalytic performance of BiOCl shows high dependency on its exposed crystal facets. In this brief review, we highlight the recent progress on the photocatalysis of different exposed crystal facets of BiOCl, focusing on the facet-dependent internal electric field manipulation, sensitization, carbon doping, and plasmonic hot carriers utilization. Understanding of the facet-dependent photocatalysis of BiOCl will offer new guidelines for the rational design of novel catalysts."
Video game values: Human每computer interaction and games,"Pippin Barr, James Noble, Robert Biddle, ","Interacting with Computers, Volume 19, Issue 2, March 2007, Pages 180-195, ","Current human每computer interaction (HCI) research into video games rarely considers how they are different from other forms of software. This leads to research that, while useful concerning standard issues of interface design, does not address the nature of video games as games specifically. Unlike most software, video games are not made to support external, user-defined tasks, but instead define their own activities for players to engage in. We argue that video games contain systems of values which players perceive and adopt, and which shape the play of the game. A focus on video game values promotes a holistic view of video games as software, media, and as games specifically, which leads to a genuine video game HCI."

Geometrically exact beam theory without Euler angles,"P. Frank Pai, ","International Journal of Solids and Structures, Volume 48, Issue 21, 15 October 2011, Pages 3075-3090, ","In modeling highly flexible beams undergoing arbitrary rigid每elastic deformations, difficulties exist in describing large rotations using rotational variables, including three Euler angles, two Euler angles, one principal rotation angle plus three direction cosines of the principal rotation axis, four Euler parameters, three Rodrigues parameters, and three modified Rodrigues parameters. The main problem is that such rotational variables are either sequence-dependent and/or spatially discontinuous because they are not mechanics-based variables. Hence, they are not appropriate for use as nodal degrees of freedom in total-Lagrangian finite-element modeling. Moreover, it is difficult to apply boundary conditions on such discontinuous and/or sequence-dependent rotational variables. This paper presents a new geometrically exact beam theory that uses no rotation variables and has no singular points in the spatial domain. The theory fully accounts for geometric nonlinearities and initial curvatures by using Jaumann strains, exact coordinate transformations, and orthogonal virtual rotations. The derivations are presented in detail, fully nonlinear governing equations and boundary conditions are presented, a finite element formulation is included, and the corresponding governing equations for numerically exact analysis using a multiple shooting method is also derived. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the problems of using rotational variables and to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed geometrically exact displacement-based beam theory."

Anisotropy of nickel-based superalloy K418 fabricated by selective laser melting,"Zhen Chen, Shenggui Chen, Zhengying Wei, Lijuan Zhang, Yu Xiang, ","Progress in Natural Science: Materials International, Volume 28, Issue 4, August 2018, Pages 496-504, ","Selective laser melting (SLM) is a promising additive manufacturing (AM) technology for fabricating the near net-shaped parts by selectively melting and solidifying a thin powder layer with a high-intensity laser beam according to the CAD data for arbitrary components. In this work, Ni-based superalloy K418 samples were fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). To evaluate the anisotropic mechanical behavior of the SLM processed K418 samples with layer-by-layer melting, the samples were manufactured parallel (transverse specimens) and vertical (longitudinal specimens) to the building direction on the substrate. The microstructural anisotropy analysis was performed by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis was used to identify their crystallographic preferred orientation (texture) and to correlate the anisotropy of the mechanical strength with the texture of the material. The results showed that the transverse specimens had slightly higher yield strength, but much significantly higher ductility than that of the transverse specimens with the elongated columnar grains along the building direction."

Migration has a striking gender differentiated impact, with the increase in work time being greater for elderly women and girls than elderly men and boys."
"Adequacy of TRMM satellite rainfall data in driving the SWAT modeling of Tiaoxi catchment (Taihu lake basin, China)","Dan Li, George Christakos, Xinxin Ding, Jiaping Wu, ","Journal of Hydrology, Volume 556, January 2018, Pages 1139-1152, ","Spatial rainfall data is an essential input to Distributed Hydrological Models (DHM), and a significant contributor to hydrological model uncertainty. Model uncertainty is higher when rain gauges are sparse, as is often the case in practice. Currently, satellite-based precipitation products increasingly provide an alternative means to ground-based rainfall estimates, in which case a rigorous product assessment is required before implementation. Accordingly, the twofold objective of this work paper was the real-world assessment of both (a) the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall product using gauge data, and (b) the TRMM product＊s role in forcing data for hydrologic simulations in the area of the Tiaoxi catchment (Taihu lake basin, China). The TRMM rainfall products used in this study are the Version-7 real-time 3B42RT and the post-real-time 3B42. It was found that the TRMM rainfall data showed a superior performance at the monthly and annual scales, fitting well with surface observation-based frequency rainfall distributions. The Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient of Efficiency (NSCE) and the relative bias ratio (BIAS) were used to evaluate hydrologic model performance. The satisfactory performance of the monthly runoff simulations in the Tiaoxi study supports the view that the implementation of real-time 3B42RT allows considerable room for improvement. At the same time, post-real-time 3B42 can be a valuable tool of hydrologic modeling, water balance analysis, and basin water resource management, especially in developing countries or at remote locations in which rainfall gauges are scarce."

However, studies are rare on the combined impact of RHR and obesity on prehypertension and hypertension. This study aimed to investigate the association between RHR and hypertension with different waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) in Chinese.The population-based cross-sectional study was conducted during 2013-2015 in Henan province, China, and 15,536 participants ≡ 15 years were included. RHR was classified according to sex-specific quartiles. The cut-off value of WHtR was 0.5 in both sexes. Multi-linear and multi-logistic regression model were used to evaluate the association of RHR, WHtR with prehypertension and hypertension.In both sexes, higher RHR was associated with higher blood pressure and lower pulse pressure. Compared with the lowest RHR quartile, participants in the highest RHR quartile had an increased risk of prehypertension (OR:1.40, 95%CI:1.18-1.65; OR:1.27, 95%CI:1.09-1.48) and hypertension (OR:1.75, 95%CI:1.43-2.15; OR:1.36, 95%CI:1.13-1.63) for male and female respectively, after fully adjusting the data. In addition, adjusted ORs for prehypertension and hypertension of participants with high WHtR and high RHR were 2.91(95%CI:2.38-3.55) and 6.28(4.96-7.97) for male and were 2.45(2.05-2.93) and 4.63(3.66-5.85) for female respectively, compared with the normal WHtR and normal RHR.In conclusion, elevated RHR was significantly associated with the risk of prehypertension and hypertension in Chinese and WHtR as a measure of abdominal obesity further increased this association."

All patients were treated to a dose of 81 Gy prescribed to the planning target volume. Prostate specific antigen relapse was defined according to the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology consensus and Houston definitions (absolute nadir plus 2 ng/ml dated at the call). Median followup was 7 years (range 5 to 9).The 8-year actuarial PSA relapse-free survival rates for patients in favorable, intermediate and unfavorable risk groups according to the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology definition were 85%, 76% and 72%, respectively (p <0.025). The 8-year actuarial prostate specific antigen relapse-free survival rates for patients in favorable, intermediate and unfavorable risk groups according to the Houston definition were 89%, 78% and 67%, respectively (p = 0.0004). The 8-year actuarial likelihood of grade 2 rectal bleeding was 1.6%. Three patients (0.1%) experienced grade 3 rectal toxicity requiring either 1 or more transfusions or a laser cauterization procedure. No grade 4 rectal complications have been observed. The 8-year likelihood of late grade 2 and 3 (urethral strictures) urinary toxicities were 9% and 3%, respectively. Among patients who were potent before intensity modulated radiation therapy, erectile dysfunction developed in 49%. The cause specific survival outcomes for favorable, intermediate and unfavorable risk cases were 100%, 96% and 84%, respectively.These long-term results confirm our previous observations regarding the safety of high dose intensity modulated radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer. Despite the application of high radiation doses, the incidence of rectal bleeding at 8 years was less than 2%. Despite the increased conformality of the dose distribution associated with intensity modulated radiation therapy, excellent long-term tumor control outcomes were achieved."

We develop a theory underlying three measures of similarity that can be used to find groups of similar ellipsoids in p-space. Clusters of ellipsoids are suggested by dark blocks along the diagonal of a reordered dissimilarity image (RDI). The RDI is built with the recursive iVAT algorithm using any of the three (dis) similarity measures as input and performs two functions: (i) it is used to visually assess and estimate the number of possible clusters in the data; and (ii) it offers a means for comparing the three similarity measures. Finally, we apply the single linkage and CLODD clustering algorithms to three two-dimensional data sets using each of the three dissimilarity matrices as input. Two data sets are synthetic, and the third is a set of real WSN data that has one known second order node anomaly. We conclude that focal distance is the best measure of elliptical similarity, iVAT images are a reliable basis for estimating cluster structures in sets of ellipsoids, and single linkage can successfully extract the indicated clusters."

Initially, SiO2@GO@CF was successfully prepared and characterizated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourie Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). Thrombin aptamer (T-Apt) as an identification element and simulated enzyme - hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme (HG-DNAzyme) as a signal-amplified material, were applied in the CL aptasensor. Then, the immobilization properties of SiO2@GO@CF and adsorption properties of T-Apt/SiO2@GO@CF were studied. Lastly, HG-DNAzyme/T-Apt/SiO2@GO@CF was applied in construction of the CL aptasensor. When THR existed, HG-DNAzyme was desorbed from the surface of T-Apt/SiO2@GO@CF and catalyzed the CL system of luminol-H2O2. Under optimized CL conditions, THR was measured with the linear concentration range of 1.5℅10-14 to 2.5℅10-11 mol/L and the detection limit of 6.3℅10-15 mol/L (3汛). The proposed CL aptasensor was used to the determination of THR in human serum samples and recoveries ranged from 99.0% to 102.4%. Those satisfactory results illustrated the CL aptasensor could achieve highly sensitive and selective detection of THR and revealed potential application in practical samples.Download high-res image (278KB)Download full-size image"
Renal Cell Carcinoma in an End-stage Kidney: Evaluation with Spectral Doppler Ultrasound,"Ho Yun Lee, Seung Hyup Kim, Sung Il Jung, Sung Il Hwang, Hak Jong Lee, ","Journal of Medical Ultrasound, Volume 12, Issue 3, 2004, Pages 91-94, ","The major reason for clinical concern in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the increased incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Ultrasound (US) has been the imaging procedure of choice in patients with impaired renal function. However, the small kidneys of ESRD are often difficult to image with US. We present spectral Doppler US findings in a case of RCC associated with ESRD and suggest the use of spectral Doppler US in the detection and differential diagnosis of RCC associated with ESRD. In our case, the Doppler US spectrum in the RCC showed high peak systolic velocity and low resistance, which was quite different from the high-resistance spectrum in other parts of the kidney. High peak systolic velocity in renal malignancies is probably due to intratumoral arteriovenous shunting. Abnormal blood vessels formed by an angiogenic factor secreted in malignant lesions lack the normal requisite of smooth muscle cells within their walls. Consequently, resistance to flow is decreased and diastolic flow is increased, resulting in a low-resistance flow pattern. Hence, spectral Doppler US can be used in the evaluation of kidneys with ESRD, especially when RCC is suspected."

The present work was undertaken to shed some light on IAA metabolism in roots, nodules and non-rhizobial bacteria in nodule of Abrus precatorius L. Three IAA producing bacterial strains (A3CK, A7CK and A27CK) were isolated from the root nodule of legume A. precatorius L. and identified as Enterobacter spp. (Gammaproteobacteria) based on biochemical characteristics and 16S rDNA sequence homology. The root nodules of this plant contain higher amount of tryptophan, IAA and total phenol than the non-nodulated roots; but IAA metabolizing enzymes IAA oxidase, IAA peroxidase (E.C. 1.11.1.7) and polyphenol oxidase (E.C. 1.14.18.1) content were reversed. The Enterobacter spp. were found to produce copious amount of IAA in tryptophan supplemented YEM medium. The IAA production was enhanced with the optimization of the suitable carbon as mannitol, nitrogen as L-asparagine and vitamin as biotin sources in culture medium. The IAA production was also found to be stimulated by protocatechuic acid and ferulic acid in culture medium for A3CK and A7CK strain, respectively, but inhibited by rest of the phenolics tested. The presence of PGPR traits including ACC deaminase (E.C. 4.1.99.4) activity might be essential for plant microbe interaction, nodule function and plant growth promotion."

Methods: In a randomized, controlled study, 98 patients (mean age, 70.8 ㊣ 10.5 years) admitted to hospital with left ventricular failure (New York Heart Association Class IV) were assigned to routine care (RC, n = 47) or MDC (n = 51). All patients received the same components of inpatient, optimal medical care of HF: specialist-led inpatient care; titration to maximum tolerated dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor before discharge; attainment of predetermined discharge criteria (weight stable, off all intravenous therapy, and no change in oral regimen for 2 days). Only those in the MDC group received inpatient and outpatient education and close telephone and clinic follow-up. The primary study endpoint was rehospitalization or death for a HF-related issue at 3 months. Main findings: At 3 months, four people had events in the MDC group (7.8% rate over 3 months) compared with 12 people (25.5% rate over 3 months) in the RC group (P = 0.04). Conclusion: These data demonstrate for the first time the intrinsic benefit of MDC in the setting of protocol-driven, optimal medical management of HF. Moreover, the event rate of 7.8% at 3 months, as the lowest reported rate for such a high-risk group, underlines the value of this approach to the management of heart failure."

Integrating our proteomic measurements with the genomic data yielded a number of insights into disease, such as how different copy-number alternations influence the proteome, the proteins associated with chromosomal instability, the sets of signaling pathways that diverse genome rearrangements converge on, and the ones most associated with short overall survival. Specific protein acetylations associated with homologous recombination deficiency suggest a potential means for stratifying patients for therapy.

The decision to become an orthodontist was made by 42% of respondents while they were in dental school; 33% had decided after completing dental school, and 24% had already decided before starting their dental school studies. Most residents (82%) planned to work in a private practice environment. Only 2 (4.5%) indicated that they will most likely practice primarily in an academic setting. Eighty percent said that they will use self-ligating brackets in private practice, and almost 80% said they will use Invisalign (Align Technology, Santa Clara, Calif). A total of 55% indicated that orthodontic residents should be required to undertake research leading to a masters of science degree as part of their orthodontic program. A total of 77% thought that a 24- to 30-month program was too short to adequately prepare them for private practice.Intellectual stimulation was the major attraction of most applicants to orthodontic programs, and the decision to become an orthodontist was normally made during dental school or even earlier. Most residents intended to enter an urban or suburban private practice after graduation, with few considering academic career choices. Modern techniques such as self-ligating brackets and Invisalign are expected to be popular among future orthodontists in Canada."
"Influences of solution subcooling, wall superheat and porous-layer coating on heat transfer in a horizontal-tube, falling-film heat exchanger","Nicholas Bogan, Chanwoo Park, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 68, January 2014, Pages 141-150, ","An experimental study was conducted to investigate the effects of solution subcooling and wall superheat on both sensible and evaporative heat transfer in a falling-film heat exchanger using both plain and porous-layer coated tubes. By varying the subcooling and wall superheat, it was seen that the portions of sensible and evaporative heat transfers could be controlled. Since the falling-film heat exchanger is limited by the coupled relationship between flooding of the upstream tubes and partial dry-out of the bottommost tubes, the ability to control this evaporation-to-sensible heat transfer ratio is important in system optimization. It was shown that sensible heat transfer can be promoted for the upstream tubes while evaporation heat transfer can be promoted for the downstream tubes. Since sensible heat transfer is enhanced by higher solution Reynolds number and therefore larger film thickness, flooding of the upstream tube rows is no longer detrimental."

A review of nuclear batteries,"Mark A. Prelas, Charles L. Weaver, Matthew L. Watermann, Eric D. Lukosi, Denis A. Wisniewski, ","Progress in Nuclear Energy, Volume 75, August 2014, Pages 117-148, ","This paper reviews recent efforts in the literature to miniaturize nuclear battery systems. The potential of a nuclear battery for longer shelf-life and higher energy density when compared with other modes of energy storage make them an attractive alternative to investigate. The performance of nuclear batteries is a function of the radioisotope(s), radiation transport properties and energy conversion transducers. The energy conversion mechanisms vary significantly between different nuclear battery types, where the radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, is typically considered a performance standard for all nuclear battery types. The energy conversion efficiency of non-thermal-type nuclear batteries requires that the two governing scale lengths of the system, the range of ionizing radiation and the size of the transducer, be well-matched. Natural mismatches between these two properties have been the limiting factor in the energy conversion efficiency of small-scale nuclear batteries. Power density is also a critical performance factor and is determined by the interface of the radioisotope to the transducer. Solid radioisotopes are typically coated on the transducer, forcing the cell power density to scale with the surface area (limiting power density). Methods which embed isotopes within the transducer allow the power density to scale with cell volume (maximizing power density). Other issues that are examined include the limitations of shelf-life due to radiation damage in the transducers and the supply of radioisotopes to sustain a commercial enterprise. This review of recent theoretical and experimental literature indicates that the physics of nuclear batteries do not currently support the objectives of miniaturization, high efficiency and high power density. Instead, the physics imply that nuclear batteries will be of moderate size and limited power density. The supply of radioisotopes is limited and cannot support large scale commercialization. Niche applications for nuclear batteries exist, and advances in materials science may enable the development of high-efficiency solid-state nuclear batteries in the near term."
Computational Modeling of HHH Therapy and Impact of Blood Pressure and Hematocrit,"Joe Sam Robinson, M. Sami Walid, Sinjae Hyun, Robert O'Connell, Brandi Bohleber, ","World Neurosurgery, Volume 74, Issues 2每3, August每September 2010, Pages 294-296, ","After an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral microcirculatory changes occur as a result cerebral vasospasm. The objective of this study is to investigate, with a computational model, how various degrees of vasospasm are influenced by increasing the mean blood pressure and decreasing the blood viscosity.Using ANSYS CFX software, a computational model was constructed to simulate steady-state fully developed laminar blood flow through a rigid wall system consisting of the internal carotid artery (ICA), anterior cerebral artery, posterior cerebral artery, and middle cerebral artery (MCA). The MCA was selected for the site of a single acute vasospasm. Five severities of vasospasm were studied: 3 mm (normal), 2.5, 2, 1.5, and 1 mm. The ICA was assumed to have a constant inlet flow rate of 315 mL/min. The anterior cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery were assumed to have constant outlet flow rates of 105 mL/min and 30 mL/min, respectively. The MCA was assumed to have a constant outlet pressure of 92 mL/min. Two different hematocrits, 45% and 32%, were simulated using the models.For a hematocrit of 45, the mean ICA inlet pressure required to pump blood through the system was 104 mm Hg for the 3-mm diameter MCA and 105, 108, 116, and 158 mm Hg for vasospasm diameters of 2.5, 2, 1.5, and 1 mm, respectively. For a hematocrit of 32, the mean ICA inlet pressure required was 102, 103, 105, 113, and 152 mm Hg, respectively.The MCA required a large increase in mean ICA inlet pressure for vasospasm diameters less than 1.5 mm, which suggests that for vasospasms more than 50% diameter reduction, the blood pressure must be increased dramatically. Decreasing the hematocrit had minimal impact on blood flow in a constricted vessel."
Dimensionality Reduction Based on Neighborhood Preserving and Marginal Discriminant Embedding,"Yuan-Dong Lan, Huifang Deng, Tao Chen, ","Procedia Engineering, Volume 29, 2012, Pages 494-498, ","Data with high dimensionality often occurs, which will produce large time and energy overheads when directly used in classification tasks. So, as one of the most important fields in machine learning, dimensionality reduction has been paid more and more attention and has achieved a prodigious progress in the theory and algorithm research. Linear Graph embedding (LGE) model is an efficient tool for dimensionality reduction. According to the problems of supervised dimensionality reduction with Non-Gaussian data distributions and at the same time consider neighborhood preserving relations among samples, a novel subspace learning method, neighborhood preserving and marginal discriminant embedding (NP-MDE), is proposed based on LGE and marginal Fisher analysis in this paper. NP-MDE could minimize the within-class scatter and meanwhile maximize the margin among different classes. Moreover, the neighborhood structure with each class is preserved. Experiments on Yale face image data sets show that after dimensionality reduction using NP-MDE, the average classification accuracy is very good."
Rainbow-Seq: Combining Cell Lineage Tracing with Single-Cell RNA Sequencing in Preimplantation Embryos,"Fernando H. Biase, Qiuyang Wu, Riccardo Calandrelli, Marcelo Rivas-Astroza, Sheng Zhong, ","iScience, Volume 7, 28 September 2018, Pages 16-29, ","We developed the Rainbow-seq technology to trace cell division history and reveal single-cell transcriptomes. With distinct fluorescent protein genes as lineage markers, Rainbow-seq enables each single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiment to simultaneously decode the lineage marker genes and read single-cell transcriptomes. We triggered lineage tracking in each blastomere at the 2-cell stage, observed microscopically inequivalent contributions of the progeny to the two embryonic poles at the blastocyst stage, and analyzed every single cell at either 4- or 8-cell stage with deep paired-end sequencing of full-length transcripts. Although lineage difference was not marked unequivocally at a single-gene level, it became clear when the transcriptome was analyzed as a whole. Moreover, several groups of novel transcript isoforms with embedded repeat sequences exhibited lineage difference, suggesting a possible link between DNA demethylation and cell fate decision. Rainbow-seq bridged a critical gap between division history and single-cell RNA-seq assays.Download high-res image (196KB)Download full-size image"
Tailoring microstructural features of wire arc additive manufacturing 2Cr13 part via varying inter-layer dwelling time,"Jinguo Ge, Jian Lin, Hanguang Fu, Yongping Lei, Rongshi Xiao, ","Materials Letters, Volume 232, 1 December 2018, Pages 11-13, ","The phase constitution, the microstructural growth behavior, and the anti-indentation performance of 2Cr13 thin-wall part were successfully tailored through inter-layer dwelling time alteration using cold metal transfer (CMT) technology. The short inter-layer dwelling time induced the presence of a low amount of 污-Fe phase, as well as extremely elongated ferrite grains containing ultrafine needle-shaped martensite throughout the entire part. This finally led to a narrow fluctuation in microhardness. The long dwelling time contributed to the 汐-Fe phase formation only and a periodic microhardness trendline, which was related to a periodic microstructure featured by martensite laths within the block-shaped ferrite matrix. This method, in an intentional manner, could be adopted to manufacture a particular component with local properties that are altered with location through a single material deposition."
Modeling and image motion analysis of parallel complementary compressive sensing imaging system,"Yun-Hui Li, Xiao-Dong Wang, Zhi Wang, Dan Liu, Ye Ding, ","Optics Communications, Volume 423, 15 September 2018, Pages 100-110, ","Based on the theory of compressive sensing, a parallel complementary compressive sensing imaging system is proposed, and the mathematical model of block parallel processing is established. Parametric analysis shows that the quality of the restored image increases with the increase of observed compression ratio and the decrease of the number of blocks, which is in conflict with total amount of data and time-consuming of algorithm, and needs to be considered comprehensively. According to the demand of space remote sensing system applied in push-broom mode, the image motion model of the system is established. The results show that the image motion has a severe effect on the quality of restored image, and increasingly responsive with the decrease of the number of blocks. when the orbital image motion parameter is constant, improving the frame rate of the detector and increasing the pixel size can obtain a smaller image motion ratio, thereby enhancing the image quality. But the application scope of the system for push-broom imaging is somewhat limited for its significantly degrade under low image motion ratio."
Elemental stoichiometry indicates predominant influence of potassium and phosphorus limitation on arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in acidic soil at high altitude,"Mohammad Haneef Khan, Mukesh K. Meghvansi, Rajeev Gupta, Vijay Veer, ","Journal of Plant Physiology, Volume 189, 15 September 2015, Pages 105-112, ","The functioning of high-altitude agro-ecosystems is constrained by the harsh environmental conditions, such as low temperatures, acidic soil, and low nutrient supply. It is therefore imperative to investigate the site-specific ecological stoichiometry with respect to AM symbiosis in order to maximize the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) benefits for the plants in such ecosystems. Here, we assess the elemental stoichiometry of four Capsicum genotypes grown on acidic soil at high altitude in Arunachal Pradesh, India. Further, we try to identify the predominant resource limitations influencing the symbioses of different Capsicum genotypes with the AM fungi. Foliar and soil elemental stoichiometric relations of Capsicum genotypes were evaluated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization and occurrence under field conditions. AM fungal diversity in rhizosphere, was estimated through PCR-DGGE profiling. Results demonstrated that the symbiotic interaction of various Capsicum genotypes with the AM fungi in acidic soil was not prominent in the study site as evident from the low range of root colonization (21每43.67%). In addition, despite the rich availability of carbon in plant leaves as well as in soil, the carbon-for-phosphorus trade between AMF and plants appeared to be limited. Our results provide strong evidences of predominant influence of the potassium-limitation, in addition to phosphorus-limitation, on AM symbiosis with Capsicum in acidic soil at high altitude. We also conclude that the potassium should be considered in addition to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in further studies investigating the stoichiometric relationships with the AMF symbioses in high altitude agro-ecosystems."

Familial dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosis is commonly overlooked at the time of transplant listing,"Sara B. Seidelmann, Olga Laur, John Hwa, Eugene Depasquale, Daniel Jacoby, ","The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation, Volume 35, Issue 4, April 2016, Pages 474-480, ","The prevalence and clinical characteristics of familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDCM) among patients with end stage heart failure (ESHF) has yet to be elucidated. We sought to determine the prevalence of FDCM in ESHF in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry and compare this with center specific data from a large tertiary teaching hospital. Patients with a banked UNOS diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) whose care originated at our center then underwent detailed pedigree analysis in order to determine the true prevalence of FDCM.A total of 16,091 patients with DCM from all centers were identified in the UNOS registry of whom 492 carried the diagnosis of FDCM (3.1%). Patients with the diagnosis of FDCM tended to be younger (42 versus 49 years old in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM), p=0.001), were less likely to have diabetes (7.8% versus 16.5% in IDCM, p<0.0001), had slightly lower creatinine (1.2 versus 1.4 in IDCM, p=0.0001) and were more likely to have a panel reactive antibody level ≡ 20% (62.1% versus 44.7% in IDCM, p<0.0001). Consecutive living adult patients with ESHF were identified from the UNOS registry that had been treated at the Yale Center for Advanced Heart Failure (YCAHF). After excluding all diagnoses that did not include any form of non-ischemic DCM, 73 patients met the inclusion criteria. Center-specific UNOS data showed pre-pedigree analysis diagnosis of FDCM in 4.12% of patients (3 out of 73), consistent with that found in the UNOS database for all centers. However, after detailed family history and pedigree analysis, 19 (26%) of 73 patients were found to have FDCM, while the remaining 54 were found to have IDCM. Echocardiographic findings including mitral regurgitation, mitral valve annulus and left ventricular end diastolic dimension were not significantly different between groups when adjusting for multiple testing.The diagnosis of FDCM was missed in the majority of patients with end stage heart failure enrolled in the UNOS database, as sampled from a large, tertiary care teaching hospital in the United States. Echocardiographic findings are unlikely to aid in the differentiation between DCM and FDCM. Detailed pedigree analysis can successfully identify undiagnosed FDCM and should be encouraged prior to transplant listing as it has important implications for early detection and treatment of disease in family members."

Phase congruency melt pool edge extraction for laser additive manufacturing,"Lijun Song, Fanghua Wang, Simeng Li, Xu Han, ","Journal of Materials Processing Technology, Volume 250, December 2017, Pages 261-269, ","Melt pool geometry, as one of the most important built attributes that reflect the stability of an additive manufacturing process, has been widely used for process monitoring and process control. Currently, intensity-based gray-level image processing is generally used to extract the melt pool boundaries. However, selection of proper threshold is challenging due to the intensity-related noise and disturbance from blurred areas, flares and speckles. This paper presents a phase congruency melt pool edge extraction approach that performs well for phase-invariant but intensity-variant image boundary extraction. The results show that the phase congruency edge extraction approach can not only robustly handle disturbances from blurred areas, flares, black areas and incandescent droplets, but also obtain more accurate melt pool geometries. A real-time melt pool monitoring system is developed to monitor a geometrically dependent and time varying melt pool evolution during an additive manufacturing process."

During the 1-h access SHR females consumed more ethanol than all other groups. In Experiment 2, the same procedure was used to compare SD groups prenatally exposed to nicotine, with controls. Nicotine-exposed females consumed more ethanol during 1-h access than both nicotine-exposed and control males; but after using water intake as a covariate, the differences were not significant.

Increasing the oil content and the speed of mixing of the emulsion resulted in an increased emulsion stability.Fresh water and synthetic formation water were used to study the effect of aqueous phase salinity on the stability and viscosity of the emulsion. Surfactant dissolved in synthetic formation water was utilized to find out the possibility of injecting the surfactant into a well bore to effect emulsification in the pump or tubing for the production of heavy crude oils as oil-in-water emulsion.The effective viscosity of a viscous Egyptian crude oil (Geisum crude oil) decreased when it was emulsified with water in the presence of a nonionic surfactant in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion. It was possible to form stable emulsions with synthetic formation water characterized by a low dynamic shear viscosity.

Development of a framework for identifying and measuring collective control as a social determinant of health: findings from an evaluation of a natural policy experiment in empowerment,"Ruth Ponsford, Michelle Collins, Matt Egan, Sue Lewis, Jennie Popay, ","The Lancet, Volume 386, Supplement 2, 13 November 2015, Page s64, ","Interventions to develop community-level empowerment and participation are advocated within public health strategies that emphasise the importance of control as a social determinant of health. Approaches to defining and measuring collective control, however, are limited. We developed and applied a contextually specific framework for identifying the emergence of collective control in the early stage of a UK area-based community empowerment initiative.Existing conceptualisations of collective control were used as a basis for development of a logic model, and then framework, for identifying emergent markers of control at the level of intracapability, intercapability, and extra group action. The concepts of power within, power to, and power with were used as overarching categories under which markers of collective control capability and action were identified. The framework was applied to qualitative data generated by our team for this primary analysis from in-depth case studies carried out in ten intervention neighbourhoods in England. Data included contextual area information, 150 interviews, ethnographic observation, participatory group exercises, and the review of 30 local intervention plans. Data were coded in NVivo (version 10) with a predefined thematic framework. Narrative memos were developed and compared and contrasted within and across sites. Ethics approval for the study was awarded by Lancaster University on behalf of Liverpool and Lancaster Universities Collaboration for Public Health Research, and by each individual research institution.Application of the framework showed that collective control manifested in different ways and to varying degrees across field sites. We observed the emergence of new forms of group organising and decision making; the development of collective efficacy and linkages with other organisations; and the beginnings of community action taking place. The emergence of collective control was shaped by existing relationships between residents and histories with local organisations, as well as through features of the intervention itself, such as the provision of tailored support from national organisations. The processes of developing collective control for those involved were unstable, subject to struggle, and part of a continuing, dynamic, nonlinear process.The conceptual framework helped identify shifts in collective control capability emergent within and between community groups leading to group action, as a result of the introduction of the intervention. These shifts were nevertheless precarious and temporal, suggesting a need for approaches that capture complex collective empowerment processes in flux.This research was supported by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) School for Public Health Research."

3-Dimensional numerical simulation of superadiabatic radiant porous burner with enhanced heat recirculation,"Vahid Vandadi, Chanwoo Park, ","Energy, Volume 115, Part 1, 15 November 2016, Pages 896-903, ","A two-layer porous (fine and coarse) burner consisting of radiation corridors (finned rods) and an external preheater is numerically analyzed. The porous burner holds the flame and heats the finned rods effectively conducting heat to radiating disks downstream, while the sensible energy of the flue gas is recovered before exiting the burner by a preheater carrying a secondary air that mixes upstream with the fuel and primary air. Combination of inherent internal heat recirculation in the porous burner, external heat recovery and effective radiating pathways using the finned rods causes the exiting flue gas having a temperature lower than the radiating disks. The synchronized heat recirculation and preheating extend the lean flammability limit to 0.2 equivalence ratio and allow the radiating disk temperature higher than the exiting flue gas. The thermal nonequilibria (internal heat recirculation, local superadiabatic combustion and external preheating) and effective heat routing using radiation corridors are responsible for this reversed temperature leading to such a record thermal efficiency as high as 50%."
Improved cardiac function after prolonged hypothermic ischemia with the Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor HOE 694,"Mary Lee Myers, Morris Karmazyn, ","The Annals of Thoracic Surgery, Volume 61, Issue 5, May 1996, Pages 1400-1406, ","Na+/H+ exchange represents an important mechanism for pH regulation in the cardiac cell that, however, may paradoxically mediate tissue damage in the reperfused myocardium. We investigated whether inhibition of the exchanger can protect the heart against damage after prolonged hypothermic storage with the use of the selective inhibitor 3-methylsulfonyl-4-piperidinobenzoyl-guanidine methanesulfonate (HOE 694).After equilibration, isolated rabbit hearts were arrested with a 3 minute infusion of modified St. Thomas' cardioplegic solution and subsequently maintained in ischemic arrest at 4∼C for 12 hours before reperfusion at 37∼C for 60 minutes. Left ventricular function and creatine kinase release were measured at intervals throughout reperfusion. High-energy phosphate and adenine nucleotide content were determined in hearts before cardioplegia, at the end of the 12-hour storage period, and at the end of reperfusion. HOE 694 (1 米mol/L) was administered either with cardioplegia and throughout reperfusion (study 1) or selectively with either cardioplegia or reperfusion only (study 2).In study 1, systolic function in untreated hearts recovered to less than 40% of preischemic values and was associated with a greater than 1,000% percent sustained elevation in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. In contrast, systolic recovery in HOE 694-treated hearts was significantly accelerated and improved to approximately 80%, whereas left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased to only 300% of baseline. Significant protection also occurred in those hearts in which HOE 694 was administered only at reperfusion while the drug was less effective if given only during cardioplegia. Creatine kinase release was not significantly affected except in study 2, where it was significantly lower after 60 minutes of reperfusion in hearts where HOE 694 was added at the time of reperfusion. Tissue metabolite content was not affected by drug treatment.This study shows a marked protective effect of the Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor HOE 694 in rabbit hearts subjected to 12 hours of hypothermic ischemia and strongly suggests that antiport inhibitors could play an effective role in myocardial preservation."
Crystal Structures of Lipoglycopeptide Antibiotic Deacetylases: Implications for the Biosynthesis of A40926 and Teicoplanin,"Yaozhong Zou, Joseph S. Brunzelle, Satish K. Nair, ","Chemistry & Biology, Volume 15, Issue 6, 23 June 2008, Pages 533-545, ","The lipoglycopeptide antibiotics teicoplanin and A40926 have proven efficacy against Gram-positive pathogens. These drugs are distinguished from glycopeptide antibiotics by N-linked long chain acyl-D-glucosamine decorations that contribute to antibacterial efficacy. During the biosynthesis of lipoglycopeptides, tailoring glycosyltransferases attach an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine to the aglycone, and this N-acetyl-glucosaminyl pseudoaglycone is deacetylated prior to long chain hydrocarbon attachment. Here we present several high-resolution crystal structures of the pseudoaglycone deacetylases from the biosynthetic pathways of teicoplanin and A40926. The cocrystal structure of the teicoplanin pseudoaglycone deacetylase with a fatty acid product provides further insights into the roles of active-site residues, and suggests mechanistic similarities with structurally distinct zinc deacetylases, such as peptidoglycan deacetylase and LpxC. A unique, structurally mobile capping lid, located at the apex of these pseudoaglycone deacetylases, likely serves as a determinant of substrate specificity."
Analytical solutions of superadiabatic filtration combustion,"Vahid Vandadi, Chanwoo Park, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 117, February 2018, Pages 740-747, ","Analytical solutions for superadiabatic filtration combustion of lean methane-air mixtures in a monolithic porous burner are sought. The one-dimensional, local volume-averaged equations of energy and species conservation that assume a non-thermal equilibrium (i.e., the two-medium treatment), are converted by a coordinate transformation using a combustion wave speed and solved to obtain close-form solutions. A parametric examination varying inlet gas velocity, fuel equivalence ratio, porosity, and thermal conductivity and diffusivity of the solid phase of the porous burner proves the validity of the analytical solutions which are in an excellent agreement with the numerical benchmark. The analytical solutions depict the key features of the filtration combustion such as non-thermal equilibrium between the solid and gas phases, superadiabatic flame temperature, and internal heat recirculation between solid and gas phases of the porous burner."
Theoretical aspects of diamond films and laser action,"Heinrich Hora, Mark A.

With the condition that the material has to be a direct band semiconductor, the results of Picket and Mehl (SPIE, 877 (1988) 64) are used for calculations at very high stresses, allowing the laser wavelength to be shifted even further into the UV. In the present case, this stress is produced by crystal defects, and is similar to the stress produced in silicon after strong ion implantation. By comparison with other e-beam excited lasers, the UV diamond laser should achieve a high efficiency of up to 35%."

This unified framework allows us to examine how the various modes of inductive inference can be combined and how their relative weights change endogenously. For example, we establish conditions under which an agent who does not know the structure of the data generating process will decrease, over the course of her reasoning, the weight of credence put on Bayesian vs. non-Bayesian reasoning. We illustrate circumstances under which probabilistic models are used until an unexpected outcome occurs, whereupon the agent resorts to more basic reasoning techniques, such as case-based and rule-based reasoning, until enough data are gathered to formulate a new probabilistic model."
Gene expression profiling of brain metastatic cell from triple negative breast cancer: Understanding the molecular events,"Li Zhou, Hong-Fang Gao, Ding-Sheng Liu, Jin-Yi Feng, Wei Xia, ","Gene, Volume 640, 15 January 2018, Pages 21-27, ","Brain metastatic triple negative breast cancer (BM-TNBC) is afflicted with unfavorable prognosis. However, the molecular events underlying BM-TNBC remain largely unknown. In the present study, we conducted gene expression microarray analysis using the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and its brain metastatic derivative (MDA-MB-231Brm). Results of microarray analysis showed that a total of 4296 genes were differentially expressed, of which 2433 genes were up-regulated and 1863 genes were down-regulated. Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG pathway and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses indicated differentially expressed genes functionally categorized as genes of signal transduction, multicellular organismal development, ion transport, nervous system development, plasma membrane, extracellular region, calcium ion binding, GTP binding neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. The validity of the microarray results was verified by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of twelve representative genes. The present findings revealed molecular basis and events associated with brain metastasis in TNBC, which will potentially contribute to the understanding of underlying mechanism and develop therapeutic targets."
A polysulfone-based anion exchange membrane for phosphoric acid concentration and purification by electro-electrodialysis,"Xiaoling Duan, Cunwen Wang, Tielin Wang, Xiaolin Xie, Yunsheng Ye, ","Journal of Membrane Science, Volume 552, 15 April 2018, Pages 86-94, ","A series of quaternary ammonium polysulfone (QAPSU) anion exchange membranes used the chlorotrimethylsilane instead of toxic chloromethyl methyl ether and quaternized-functionalized by trimethylamine ethanol solution were prepared.

When being applied in electro-electrodialysis (EED) for purifying phosphoric acid solution, the QAPSU membranes exhibit high purification efficiency, especially all the metal ions (Fe, Mg, Ca) removal rates reach over 60%, which suggests that the QAPSU membranes have a high potential for EED application."

Motion-driven flow in an unusual piscine nasal region,"Mawuli P. K. Agbesi, Heather S. Borsuk, Jeremy N. Hunt, James S. Maclaine, Jonathan P. L. Cox, ","Zoology, Volume 119, Issue 6, December 2016, Pages 500-510, ","Fishes have several means of moving water to effect odorant transport to their olfactory epithelium (＆olfactory flow＊). Here we show that olfactory flow in the adult garpike Belone belone (Belonidae, Teleostei), a fish with an unusual nasal region, can be generated by its motion relative to water (swimming, or an external current, or both). We also show how the unusual features of the garpike＊s nasal region influence olfactory flow. These features comprise a triangular nasal cavity in which the olfactory epithelium is exposed to the external environment, a papilla situated within the nasal cavity, and an elongated ventral apex. To perform our investigation we first generated life-like plastic models of garpike heads from X-ray scans of preserved specimens. We then suspended these models in a flume and flowed water over them to simulate swimming. By directing filaments of dye at the static models, we were able to visualise flow in the nasal regions at physiologically relevant Reynolds numbers (700每2,000). We found that flow of water over the heads did cause circulation in the nasal cavity. Vortices may assist in this circulation. The pattern of olfactory flow was influenced by morphological variations and the asymmetry of the nasal region. The unusual features of the nasal region may improve odorant sampling in the garpike, by dispersing flow over the olfactory epithelium and by creating favourable conditions for odorant transport (e.g. steep velocity gradients). Unexpectedly, we found that the mouth and the base of the garpike＊s jaws may assist the sampling process. Thus, despite its apparent simplicity, the garpike＊s nasal region is likely to act as an effective trap for odorant molecules."
Hydrodynamic behavior of silicon particles with a wide size distribution in a draft tube spout-fluid bed,"Yuemei Zhang, Guoqiang Huang, Guoliang Su, ","Chemical Engineering Journal, Volume 328, 15 November 2017, Pages 645-653, ","An experimental study on the hydrodynamic behavior of silicon particles with a wide size distribution in a draft tube spout-fluid bed was performed in a 182 diameter cylindrical column with a flat gas distributor. Effects of spouting and fluidizing gas velocity, static bed height, entrainment zone height and draft tube diameter on the maximum spouting pressure drop, minimum stable spouting velocity and solids circulation rate were investigated. The results show that the maximum spouting pressure drop increases with static bed height, entrainment zone height, draft tube diameter and fluidizing gas velocity. The minimum spouting velocity increases with entrainment zone height, while it decreases with static bed height, draft tube diameter and fluidizing gas velocity. Two correlations on the maximum pressure drop and minimum spouting velocity are proposed respectively based on the experimental data, which are in good agreement with the present experiments. In addition, the solids circulation rate increases with static bed height, draft tube diameter, fluidizing and spouting gas velocity. It also increases with entrainment zone height at a lower fluidizing gas velocity, however it decreases with entrainment zone height at a higher fluidizing gas velocity."
Synthesis and mechanistic studies of a mitomycin dimer containing an eight-membered cyclic disulfide,"Hyun Jung Park, Jae Jin Kim, Hyoung Rae Kim, Eun Kyung Lee, Sang Hyup Lee, ","Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, Volume 19, Issue 13, 1 July 2011, Pages 4004-4013, ","Dimeric DNA alkylating agents have drawn significant interest because these compounds are expected to provide at least two reactive sites and as a result, generate enhanced levels of DNA interstrand cross-link (DNA ISC) adducts compared to their monomeric agents. We report the synthesis and mechanistic studies of a novel mitomycin dimer, 7-N,7∩-N∩-(1∪,2∪-dithiocanyl-3∪,8∪-dimethylenyl)bismitomycin C (8) connected by an eight-membered cyclic disulfide. Mitomycins require prior activation (i.e., transformation to a good electrophile) for DNA adduction and therefore, 8 was aimed to undergo facile nucleophilic activation and produce enhanced levels of DNA ISC. At the core of this function lies a cyclic disulfide in 8. It was expected that disulfide cleavage by an appropriate nucleophile would successively produce two thiols that may trigger activation of two mitomycin rings in a dimer through intramolecular cyclization to quinine rings. Compound 8 was synthesized from mitomycin A (1) and the key intermediate, cyclic disulfide (11), along with the reference diol mitomycin 7-N,7∩-N∩-(2∪,7∪-dihydroxy-1∪,8∪-octanediyl)bismitomycin C (23) which does not contain the disulfide unit. We found that 8 underwent significantly enhanced nucleophilic activation in the presence of Et3P compared with 23, and that the disulfide unit in 8 played a key role for the nucleophilic activation. Based on these findings, we proposed a mechanism for nucleophilic activation of 8. We further demonstrated that 8 generated much higher levels of DNA ISC (94%) compared with 23 (4%) and 2 (3%) in the presence of Et3P (and l-DTT) leading to the conclusion that 8 is more efficient for DNA ISC processes than 23 and 2 due to the role of disulfide unit.A mitomycin dimer containing an eight-membered cyclic disulfide underwent fast activation and was found to be highly efficient in generating DNA interstrand cross-link (ISC) adducts under nucleophilic activation conditions."

However, little is known regarding patient knowledge of these associations. We evaluated awareness of smoking as a risk factor for genitourinary disease and identified variables associated with awareness.We performed a cross-sectional study in a convenience sample of 535 patients who presented to a urology clinic at a major public hospital between 2009 and 2011. Patient demographics and knowledge were captured in a self-reported questionnaire evaluating awareness of smoking as a risk factor for bladder, kidney and lung cancer, and erectile dysfunction. Factors associated with the awareness of smoking and genitourinary disease were identified by multivariable logistic regression.Urology patients generally had low overall awareness of smoking related genitourinary disease. Only 33.5%, 25.2% and 24.2% of patients identified smoking as a risk factor for kidney cancer, bladder cancer and erectile dysfunction, respectively, compared to 94.0% who identified it as a risk factor for lung cancer. Patients from ethnic minorities and current smokers consistently showed a more pronounced lack of awareness of the link between smoking and these diseases. Generally Hispanic and black patients were 2 to 3 times more likely than white patients to be unaware of the association of smoking with the diseases (p = 0.0019 to 0.059). Smokers were twice as likely as nonsmokers to be unaware of the link of smoking with kidney and bladder cancer (p = 0.025 and 0.0509, respectively).Our study highlights the need for increased awareness of smoking related genitourinary diseases, especially among minority patients and smokers.

Approximation techniques for dynamic real-time optimization (DRTO) of distributed MPC systems,"Hao Li, Christopher L. E. Swartz, ","Computers & Chemical Engineering, In press, corrected proof, Available online 6 August 2018, ","A dynamic real-time optimization (DRTO) strategy has recently been proposed for coordination of distributed MPC systems. The scheme utilizes a prediction model that accounts for the impact of the distributed controllers on the plant response. Two techniques are presented for approximating the closed-loop prediction within the DRTO formulation - a hybrid closed-loop and an input clipping formulation. The hybrid formulation generates closed-loop predictions for a limited number of time intervals along the DRTO prediction horizon, followed by an open-loop optimal control formulation for the rest of the horizon. The input clipping formulation utilizes an unconstrained MPC optimization formulation for each distributed MPC, coupled with an input saturation mechanism. The performance of the approximation techniques is evaluated through application to case studies based on linear and nonlinear dynamic plant models respectively. The approximation techniques are demonstrated to be more computationally efficient than the rigorous counterpart without significant loss in performance."

A management algorithm employing neurologic assessment, somatosensory evoked potential monitoring, arterial pressure augmentation, and cerebrospinal fluid drainage evolved to decrease the risk of postoperative paraplegia.Patients in thoracic aortic aneurysm stent trials from 1999 to 2004 were analyzed for paraplegic complications. Lower extremity strength was assessed after anesthesia and in the intensive care unit. A loss of lower extremity somatosensory evoked potential or lower extremity strength was treated emergently to maintain a mean arterial pressure 90 mmHg or greater and a cerebrospinal fluid pressure 10 mm Hg or less.Seventy-five patients (male = 49, female = 26, age = 75 ㊣ 7.4 years) had descending thoracic aortic aneurysms repaired with endovascular stenting. Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid drainage (n = 23) and somatosensory evoked potential monitoring (n = 15) were performed selectively in patients with significant aneurysm extent or with prior abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (n = 17). Spinal cord ischemia occurred in 5 patients (6.6%); two had lower extremity somatosensory evoked potential loss after stent deployment and 4 developed delayed-onset paraplegia. Two had full recovery in response to arterial pressure augmentation alone. Two had full recovery and one had near-complete recovery in response to arterial pressure augmentation and cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Spinal cord ischemia was associated with retroperitoneal bleed (n = 1), prior abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (n = 2), iliac artery injury (n = 1), and atheroembolism (n = 1).Early detection and intervention to augment spinal cord perfusion pressure was effective for decreasing the magnitude of injury or preventing permanent paraplegia from spinal cord ischemia after endovascular stent repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. Routine somatosensory evoked potential monitoring, serial neurologic assessment, arterial pressure augmentation, and cerebrospinal fluid drainage may benefit patients at risk for paraplegia."

Blackwell, ","Cell Chemical Biology, In press, corrected proof, Available online 19 July 2018, ","Chemical strategies to block quorum sensing (QS) could provide a route to attenuate virulence in bacterial pathogens. Considerable research has focused on this approach in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which uses the LuxR-type receptor LasR to regulate much of its QS network. Non-native ligands that antagonize LasR have been developed, yet we have little understanding of the mode by which these compounds interact with LasR and alter its function, as the receptor is unstable in their presence. Herein, we report an approach to circumvent this challenge through the study of a series of synthetic LasR agonists with varying levels of potency. Structural investigations of these ligands with the LasR ligand-binding domain reveal that certain agonists can enforce a conformation that deviates from that observed for other, often more potent agonists. These results, when combined with cell-based and biophysical analyses, suggest a functional model for LasR that could guide future ligand design.Download high-res image (117KB)Download full-size image"

Problems in geometrically exact modeling of highly flexible beams,"P. Frank Pai, ","Thin-Walled Structures, Volume 76, March 2014, Pages 65-76, ","Because the deformed beam geometry often is the most important information for applications of highly flexible beams, a geometrically exact beam theory needs to be displacement-based in order to directly and exactly describe any greatly deformed geometry. Main challenges in geometrically exact beam modeling are how to describe a beam's large reference-line deformation and cross-sectional rotations without singularity and how to derive objective directional strains in terms of global displacements and rotations that contain elastic deformation and rigid-body movement. By comparing with a geometrically exact displacement-based beam theory this paper shows that theoretical and numerical problems of other geometrically nonlinear beam theories are mainly caused by: (1) use of independent variables to account for bending-shear rotations, (2) use of problematic energy-based Green每Lagrange strains in order to have objective strain measures, and/or (3) use of strain-based formulations in order not to use problematic Green每Lagrange strains. The theoretical problems include inconsistent governing equations from energy- and momentum-based formulations, inexistence of material property matrices for the chosen strain and stress measures, and non-directional stresses.

Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) supports NADPH oxidase1 (Nox1)-based superoxide generation and cell migration,"Jaeyul Kwon, Aibing Wang, Devin J. Burke, Howard E. Boudreau, Thomas L. Leto, ","Free Radical Biology and Medicine, Volume 96, July 2016, Pages 99-115, ","Nox1 is an abundant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in colon epithelium recently shown to function in wound healing and epithelial homeostasis. We identified Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) as a novel binding partner of Nox activator 1 (Noxa1) in yeast two-hybrid screening experiments using the Noxa1 SH3 domain as bait. Prdx6 is a unique member of the Prdx antioxidant enzyme family exhibiting both glutathione peroxidase and phospholipase A2 activities. We confirmed this interaction in cells overexpressing both proteins, showing Prdx6 binds to and stabilizes wild type Noxa1, but not the SH3 domain mutant form, Noxa1 W436R. We demonstrated in several cell models that Prdx6 knockdown suppresses Nox1 activity, whereas enhanced Prdx6 expression supports higher Nox1-derived superoxide production. Both peroxidase- and lipase-deficient mutant forms of Prdx6 (Prdx6 C47S and S32A, respectively) failed to bind to or stabilize Nox1 components or support Nox1-mediated superoxide generation. Furthermore, the transition-state substrate analogue inhibitor of Prdx6 phospholipase A2 activity (MJ-33) was shown to suppress Nox1 activity, suggesting Nox1 activity is regulated by the phospholipase activity of Prdx6. Finally, wild type Prdx6, but not lipase or peroxidase mutant forms, supports Nox1-mediated cell migration in the HCT-116 colon epithelial cell model of wound closure. These findings highlight a novel pathway in which this antioxidant enzyme positively regulates an oxidant-generating system to support cell migration and wound healing.Download high-res image (253KB)Download full-size image"
Comparative genomics analysis of Clostridium difficile epidemic strain DH/NAP11/106,"Larry K. Kociolek, Dale N. Gerding, David W. Hecht, Egon A. Ozer, ","Microbes and Infection, Volume 20, Issue 4, April 2018, Pages 245-253, ","Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 106 (also identified as restriction endonuclease analysis [REA] group DH) recently emerged as the most common strain causing C. difficile infection (CDI) among US adults. We previously identified this strain predominating our pediatric cohort. Pediatric clinical CDI isolates previously characterized by REA underwent antibiotic resistance testing and whole genome sequencing. Of 134 isolates collected from children, 31 (23%) were REA group DH. We performed a comparative genomics analysis to identify DH-associated accessory genes. We identified five DH-associated genes that are associated with virulence in other bacterial species but not previously known to contribute to CDI. These genes are associated with intestinal mucosal adhesion (collagen-binding surface protein), sporulation (sporulation integral membrane protein YtvI), and protection from oxidative stress and foreign DNA (DNA phosphorothioation-dependent restriction proteins, sulfurtransferase, and DNA sulfur modification proteins). The association of these genes was validated in a cohort of 623 publicly available C. difficile sequences, 10 (1.6%) of which were monophyletic to REA group DH through in silico multilocus sequence typing and core genome phylogenetic analysis. Further investigation is required to determine the contribution of these genes to the emergence and virulence of this epidemic strain."
Size dependent thermal conductivity of Si nanosystems based on phonon gas dynamics,"Yuan Dong, Bing-Yang Cao, Zeng-Yuan Guo, ","Physica E: Low-dimensional Systems and Nanostructures, Volume 56, February 2014, Pages 256-262, ","The silicon nanosystems have shown a great potential for high efficient energy conversion devices due to the strong size effect on thermal conductivity. An accurate and convenient prediction model for such size effect is highly desired. In this paper a macroscopic heat conduction model for nano-systems is presented based on the phonon gas dynamics, in which heat conduction is regarded as phonon gas flow in a porous medium. The resistant term in the momentum equation of the phonon gas flow consists of two parts. One is the Darcy's term, representing the volume resistance and another is the Brinkman term, representing the surface resistance. The latter is usually negligible compared with the former for the medium at the normal scale, while the relative importance of the Brinkman term increases and consequently, the thermal conductivity decreases with size reduction. The effective phonon gas viscosity is extracted from the experiments and found to be proportional to the system size in nanoscale based on the rarefied gas dynamics. In this way an explicit expression for the size dependent thermal conductivity of silicon nanosystems is obtained, which agrees well with the experimental results for both nano-wires and films.Download full-size image"

Finally, we find the discrete-time models of the first-order, second-order and third-order systems from their continuous-time models and vice-versa and find the mapping relationship between the coefficients of discrete-time models and the continuous-time models using the bilinear transform. An example is provided to demonstrate the proposed model transform methods."

The effects of CpG ODNs and IFN-汐 were evaluated in murine models of melanoma in wild-type, IFN-污每deficient, and STAT1-deficient mice. Negative controls in all experiments included treatment with control ODN or phosphate-buffered saline.Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with a combination of CpG ODNs and IFN-汐 resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity, activation of natural killer cells, IFN-汐每induced STAT1 phosphorylation, and transcription levels of ISG-15. These immunostimulatory effects of CpG ODNs were associated with increased expression of STAT1 and STAT2 proteins. Administration of CpG ODNs plus IFN-汐 elicited superior antitumor activity in a murine model of B16 melanoma compared with either agent alone. The antitumor properties of CpG ODNs were dependent on STAT1-mediated signal transduction within the host but independent of endogenously produced IFN-污.CpG ODNs represent potent immune stimulants that elicit antitumor effects through STAT1-mediated signal transduction."

This was the objective of the present studyIn this prospective cohort study, 5333 non-abstaining individuals (2539 women) from the UK-wide Health and Lifestyle Survey (aged 42.9 years at study induction) completed the CAGE questionnaire of alcohol problems and participated in a medical examination in 1984/1985; they were then followed up for mortality experience until 2005.Alcohol problems at baseline were less common in women (2.4%) than in men (7.8%). A total of 21 years of follow-up gave rise to 1201 deaths. Elevated rates of mortality were evident in persons reporting symptoms of alcohol problems in comparison to those who did not. In gender-stratified analyses, alcohol problems were more strongly associated with mortality risk in women (age-adjusted hazards ratio: 2.25; 95% confidence interval: 1.22每4.12) than in men (1.49; 1.12每1.99), although this effect modification was not statistically significant (P value for interaction=0.125). Controlling for a range of covariates〞including socioeconomic position, co-morbidity (somatic and psychiatric), and alcohol intake〞had essentially no impact on these associations.The CAGE questionnaire may have some utility in routine health assessments in the general population."

Fouling and rejection behavior of carbon nanotube membranes,"Seung-Min Park, Jungwoo Jung, Sangho Lee, Youngbin Baek, Yong Hyup Kim, ","Desalination, Volume 343, 16 June 2014, Pages 180-186, ","In recent years, there has been a growing interest in nanostructure membranes made of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VA-CNT) due to their potential of high water permeability. Nevertheless, membrane fouling is one of the most critical issues in these VA-CNT membranes. Accordingly, this study mainly focused on understanding of membrane fouling of VA-CNT membranes, which were prepared by thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. Surface modification by graft-polymerization of methacrylic acid (MA) was attempted to not only retard membrane fouling but also improve solute rejection. The resistance-in-series model was applied to characterize the properties of fouling layers. BSA (bovine serum albumin) was used as the model foulant. Results indicated that the VA-CNT membranes had higher fouling propensity than polymeric membranes. After surface modification, however, irreversible fouling was significantly reduced in the VA-CNT membranes, which was attributed to an increase in hydrophilicity and surface charge. The rejection of BSA by VA-CNT membrane also increased after surface modification, suggesting that the surface charge played an important role in the rejection of charged molecules."
Linguistic summarization of video for fall detection using voxel person and fuzzy logic,"Derek Anderson, Robert H. Luke, James M.

The first level infers the states of the person at each image. The second level operates on linguistic summarizations of voxel person＊s states and inference regarding activity is performed. The rules used for fall detection were designed under the supervision of nurses to ensure that they reflect the manner in which elders perform these activities. The proposed framework is extremely flexible. Rules can be modified, added, or removed, allowing for per-resident customization based on knowledge about their cognitive and physical ability."
Antiviral protection against enterovirus 71 mediated by autophagy induction following FLICE-inhibitory protein inactivation,"Minah Won, Eun Jung Jun, Maria Khim, Sang Hyup Hong, Heuiran Lee, ","Virus Research, Volume 169, Issue 1, October 2012, Pages 316-320, ","Even with the recent awareness of enterovirus 71 (EV71) as a major public health issue, there are no preventive or therapeutic agents that are effective against EV71 infection. Although FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) has been identified as a factor that modulates virus pathogenesis, there are no reports regarding its effects on EV71 infection. The aim of the present study was to identify whether FLIP influences EV71 pathogenesis and to understand the underlying mechanisms. Virus replication was markedly reduced in MRC5 cells preincubated with anti-FLIP peptides, and infected cells were rescued from the cytopathic effects of the virus. The anti-FLIP peptides induced autophagy by disrupting intrinsic FLIP functions. The antiviral activity of these peptides was reduced when autophagy was inhibited by treatment with siRNA targeted to beclin-1. Thus, the present study provides evidence that anti-FLIP peptides induce autophagy by inactivating cFLIP, and that this is associated with antiviral effects against EV71."

There was no correlation between potency of NMT inhibition and potency of 汐2 receptor antagonism (as measured by inhibition of tritiated clonidine binding) among NMT inhibitors representing several chemical classes or among members of a single class of compounds, l-aminoindans. In addition, several potent 汐2 blocking drugs were essentially inactive as NMT inhibitors. These findings indicate that NMT inhibition and 汐2 blockade are dissociable activities. Future development of NMT inhibitors should include this dissociation as a goal to increase the usefulness of NMT inhibitors as pharmacologic tools."

ABO isoimmunization: the use of the specific Coombs and heat elution tests in the detection of hemolytic disease,"Sol Haberman, C. James Krafft, Percy E. Luecke, Richard O. Peach, ","The Journal of Pediatrics, Volume 56, Issue 4, April 1960, Pages 471-477, ","A method of early recognition and identification of ABO erythroblastosis is presented. This involves the use of a potent antihuman globulin serum which has been pretested for its ability to detect adsorbed antibodies of the gamma and nongamma globulin varieties. When a positive Coombs test is found on a sample of blood from the umbilical cord, the infant's cells are treated by the heat elution method for the removal of adsorbed antibodies. The eluates thus obtained are tested against a panel of cells containing known antigens, and the specific antibodies are identified. With this early information, the physician is forewarned of the possible development of clinical disease. In our series, which includes over 316 cases of ABO isoimmunization detected by this approach, it was found that the incidence of ABO isoimmunization approximates that of Rh-Hr incompatibilities. The occurrence of clinical disease in the ABO group was much less frequent, however.Of the 3,921 heterospecific pregnancies to the ABO system, 316 infants showed positive direct Coombs tests. When heat elution tests were done on blood taken from the infant's umbilical cord, 183 or 57.91 per cent were specific for the A antigen, 28 or 8.86 per cent agglutinated only B erythrocytes, and 105 or 33.22 per cent reacted with both A and B red blood cells and appeared to be the anti-C of Wiener."

Obstacle avoidance in path planning using intersection constraint search,"Bassam Hussien, Robert W. McLaren, ","Automation in Construction, Volume 1, Issue 3, December 1992, Pages 285-295, ","An important problem in robotics is to determine an obstacle avoidance control strategy which transfers the system along a collision free path among obstacles in the work space. Most algorithms which have been developed to solve this problem are based on a mapping of the given problem into a finite state which always resulted in a problem which can be solved by a computer, but has high computational complexity. Certain previously developed algorithms worked with continuous problem space, these algorithms were referred to as continuum algorithms and were relatively unsophisticated when compared to the continuous algorithms. This observation has served as a motivation for the research reported in this paper, in which it is desired to provide continuous space algorithms with a more rigorous theoretical base. The main result of this work is the development of a real-valued function, 次, which characterizes the proximal relationship of two non-point convex bodies. This function is different from similar functions reported on elsewhere in that it also provides useful information when the sets (bodies) under consideration intersect. In this paper, the need for such a function is established, and certain computationally useful properties of the developed function are demonstrated."
Bending and compressive properties of cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels made from Canadian hemlock,"Minjuan He, Xiaofeng Sun, Zheng Li, ","Construction and Building Materials, Volume 185, 10 October 2018, Pages 175-183, ","Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is an innovative engineering wood panel product made from gluing layers of solid-sawn lumber at perpendicular angles. Owing to the excellent structural rigidity in both orthogonal directions, CLT becomes a preferred construction material for shear walls, floor diaphragms, and roof assemblies. CLT is normally made of Spruce-pine-fir (SPF) lumber or Douglas fir-Larch lumber. Recently, attempts have been made to manufacture CLT with Canadian hemlock. This paper investigates the out-of-plane bending properties and compressive properties of CLT panels made from Canadian hemlock. The mechanical properties of the CLT panels in the major/minor strength directions were obtained through experimental tests, and numerical models were developed to predict bending stiffness and ultimate load resisting capacity of the CLT panels. Moreover, theoretical bending stiffness of the CLT panels was calculated according to the equations provided in different code provisions, and the calculated values were compared with the experimental data. Results show that CLT panels made from Canadian hemlock perform as well as those made from other common used lumber species (i.e. SPF or Douglas fir), and the bending stiffness and ultimate load resisting capacity of the CLT panels can be predicted by the developed numerical models. In addition, in the major strength direction, the global bending stiffness of the panels can be predicted using the theoretical bending stiffness. In the minor strength direction, the local bending stiffness of the panels can be predicted using the theoretical bending stiffness calculated according to the Shear Analogy theory. The results presented in this paper can provide fundamental basis for supporting the potential engineering application of CLT panel products made from Canadian hemlock."

The different methods that are used to prove delays, as explained in industry standards and handbooks, are theoretical and could be applied in the small simple projects with few numbers of activities but the same methods cannot easily be applied on mega/complex projects. Proving delays in mega/complex projects, whose schedules contain thousands of activities with many interfaces and lot of causes for delay and disruption is a complicated process and involves lots of details. When any degree of complexity in the project is examined, it becomes more difficult for the project team to record the delays and disruption events properly because they are always busy dealing with the site issues and other project pressures. In order for the contractors to be successful, a time extension claim or disruption claims should adequately establish causation and liability and assist in demonstrating the extend of time-related damages experienced as a direct result of the delay events relied upon. The process of recording the delays and disruption is a dynamic process and needs continuous involvement from the planning team with the support from all other departments."

Attenuation coefficient estimation using experimental diffraction corrections with multiple interface reflections,"Terence P. Lerch, Raina Cepel, Steven P. Neal, ","Ultrasonics, Volume 44, Issue 1, January 2006, Pages 83-92, ","The ultrasonic attenuation coefficient of a fluid or solid is an acoustic parameter routinely estimated for the purpose of materials characterization and defect/disease detection. This paper describes a broadband attenuation coefficient estimation technique that combines two established estimation approaches. The key elements of these two approaches are: (1) the use of magnitude spectrum ratios of front surface, first back surface, and second back surface reflections from interfaces of materials with plate-like geometries, and (2) the use of an experimental diffraction correction approach to avoid diffraction losses. The combined estimation approach simplifies the attenuation coefficient estimation process by eliminating the need to explicitly make diffraction corrections or calculate reflection/transmission coefficients. The approach yields estimates of the attenuation coefficient, reflection coefficient, and material density. Models, experimental procedures, and signal analysis procedures, which support implementation of the approach, are presented. Attenuation coefficient and reflection coefficient estimates are presented for water and solid samples with estimates based on measurements made with multiple transducers."

Risk factors identified for stroke included prior stroke (odds ratio [OR] 9.4, confidence interval [CI] 2.3 to 38.1, p = 0.002) and extent A or C coverage (OR 5.5, CI 1.7每12.5, p = 0.001). The stroke rate in patients with both prior stroke and extent A or C coverage was 27.7%. Severe atheromatous disease involving the aortic arch by computed tomographic scan was strongly associated with perioperative stroke (OR = 14.8, CI 1.7 to 675.6, p = 0.0016). Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated mobile atheroma in two patients with stroke.Stroke after TEVAR was associated with a high mortality. The TEVAR of the proximal descending aorta (extent A or C) in patients with a history of stroke had the highest perioperative stroke rate. These risk factors, together with high grade aortic atheroma of the aortic arch, predicted a high probability for cerebral embolization and can be used to identify patients at high risk for stroke as a consequence of TEVAR."
Shell side CFD analysis of a small shell-and-tube heat exchanger,"Ender Ozden, Ilker Tari, ","Energy Conversion and Management, Volume 51, Issue 5, May 2010, Pages 1004-1014, ","The shell side design of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger; in particular the baffle spacing, baffle cut and shell diameter dependencies of the heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop are investigated by numerically modeling a small heat exchanger. The flow and temperature fields inside the shell are resolved using a commercial CFD package. A set of CFD simulations is performed for a single shell and single tube pass heat exchanger with a variable number of baffles and turbulent flow. The results are observed to be sensitive to the turbulence model selection. The best turbulence model among the ones considered is determined by comparing the CFD results of heat transfer coefficient, outlet temperature and pressure drop with the Bell每Delaware method results. For two baffle cut values, the effect of the baffle spacing to shell diameter ratio on the heat exchanger performance is investigated by varying flow rate."
"Clinical and Laboratory Perspectives of Improved Orthodontic Bonding to Normal, Hypoplastic, and Fluorosed Enamel","William A. Wiltshire, James Noble, ","Seminars in Orthodontics, Volume 16, Issue 1, March 2010, Pages 55-65, ","Success in fixed orthodontic treatment is highly dependent on the maintenance of the bond between orthodontic attachments, and etched enamel for the duration of treatment. Bracket debonding can significantly increase treatment time, operator time, material costs, and patient discomfort. It is therefore essential for the orthodontist to be able to obtain reliable bonding to enamel at the initial bonding appointment. At times, the orthodontist may need to bond to compromised enamel surfaces with the standard acid-etch protocol. The advent of adhesion promoters has provided orthodontists the possibility to potentially increase the bond strength of orthodontic attachments to these compromised enamel surfaces. The current paper presents a summary of investigations of bond strengths of orthodontic attachments to normal, hypoplastic, and fluorosed enamel as well as recent advances in biomaterials technology and their impact on adhesivity."

PEM fuel cell degradation effects on the performance of a stand-alone solar energy system,"Ender Ozden, Ilker Tari, ","International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, Volume 42, Issue 18, 4 May 2017, Pages 13217-13225, ","After comparing fresh and degraded performances of Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) based components of a hydrogen cycle with the help of computational fluid dynamics simulations, recently established stand-alone solar energy system producing hydrogen for energy storage is investigated focusing on the effects of degradation of fuel cells on the overall performance of the system. A complete model of the system has been developed using TRNSYS, and a degraded PEM Fuel Cell Subsystem has been incorporated into the model. Then, the effects of the PEM fuel cell degradation on the overall performance of the energy system are estimated. After reviewing the simulation results, the model shows that the PEM Fuel Cell degradation has a substantial impact on the overall system performance causing a system down time of approximately one month in a typical simulation year. Consequently, the stand-alone system is not capable of operating continuously for a complete year when the PEM fuel cells are degraded. Furthermore, an economic analysis is performed for a project lifetime of 25 years and the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCE) value of the degraded system is found to be 0.08 $/kWh higher than the newly established system. Nevertheless, LCE calculations that are repeated for declining PV panel costs show that the considered hybrid system may be an economically competitive alternative to conventional diesel generators, even when the degradation of PEM based components and their regular maintenance are considered."
A coaxial optrode as multifunction write-read probe for optogenetic studies in non-human primates,"Ilker Ozden, Jing Wang, Yao Lu, Travis May, Arto V. Nurmikko, ","Journal of Neuroscience Methods, Volume 219, Issue 1, 30 September 2013, Pages 142-154, ","Advances in optogenetics have led to first reports of expression of light-gated ion-channels in non-human primates (NHPs). However, a major obstacle preventing effective application of optogenetics in NHPs and translation to optogenetic therapeutics is the absence of compatible multifunction optoelectronic probes for (1) precision light delivery, (2) low-interference electrophysiology, (3) protein fluorescence detection, and (4) repeated insertion with minimal brain trauma.Here we describe a novel brain probe device, a ※coaxial optrode§, designed to minimize brain tissue damage while microfabricated to perform simultaneous electrophysiology, light delivery and fluorescence measurements in the NHP brain. The device consists of a tapered, gold-coated optical fiber inserted in a polyamide tube. A portion of the gold coating is exposed at the fiber tip to allow electrophysiological recordings in addition to light delivery/collection at the tip.Coaxial optrode performance was demonstrated by experiments in rodents and NHPs, and characterized by computational models. The device mapped opsin expression in the brain and achieved precisely targeted optical stimulation and electrophysiology with minimal cortical damage.Overall, combined electrical, optical and mechanical features of the coaxial optrode allowed a performance for NHP studies which was not possible with previously existing devices.Coaxial optrode is currently being used in two NHP laboratories as a major tool to study brain function by inducing light modulated neural activity and behavior. By virtue of its design, the coaxial optrode can be extended for use as a chronic implant and multisite neural stimulation/recording."
"High-fidelity sectional analysis of warping functions, stiffness values and wave properties of beams","P. Frank Pai, ","Engineering Structures, Volume 67, 15 May 2014, Pages 77-95, ","A systematic formulation for geometrically exact deformation analysis and 2D cross-sectional analysis for obtaining structural stiffness values and warping functions of general isotropic/anisotropic beams is presented here. The formulation is developed using easy-to-understand mathematics and new concepts of local displacements, orthogonal virtual rotations and Jaumann stress and strain measures, and provides straightforward explanations for and clear insight into the physical meanings of all structural terms. The derived beam theory accounts for initial curvatures, geometric non-linearities, in-plane and out-of-plane warpings, elastic couplings, and 3D stresses. For sectional analysis, the six constraints for preventing rigid-body motions and singularity in analysis are obtained naturally and uniquely in this formulation. Central solutions from sectional analysis of different beam cross-sections are presented to reveal the problems of other methods in the literature, especially the popular but erroneous method using flexural deformation to derive shear stiffness values and shear correction factors instead of the correct method using pure shearing. Decaying boundary solutions from sectional analysis are not well examined and understood in the literature, and non-decaying boundary solutions have never been studied at all. This paper presents methods to use decaying boundary solutions for analysis of problems involving warping restraints, free edges, and local self-balanced load distributions. Furthermore, the influences of different dynamic warpings on different wave speeds are also demonstrated."
Tackling the uncertainty of spatial regulations in China: An institutional analysis of the ※multi-plan combination§,"Jiayu Wu, Yan Song, Jian Lin, Qingsong He, ","Habitat International, Volume 78, August 2018, Pages 1-12, ","To overcome the problems caused by the uncertainty of spatial regulations, a series of reforms have been proposed in China, although they are considered insufficient. In our study, we first analyse the inherent logic behind the spatial regulations in China from the perspective of two models (※interest politics§ to ※legal order§) and the context of the turn between these two models. The endogeneity and credibility thesis is adopted to explain why spatial regulation reforms that attempt to shift spatial regulation from ※interest politics§ to ※legal order§ are partial failures. This paper focuses on a case study of a ""multi-plan combination"" and argues that ""multi-plan combinations"" are spatial regulation reforms that changed ※interest politics§ in the current planning system to the ※legal order§ through uniform spatial regulation rules. The ""multi-plan combination"" reforms are not successful as the reform of ※multi-plan combinations§, which are dominated by the Chinese central government and designed exogenously without endogeneity within governments and among the social public.

Joint Adaptive Median Binary Patterns for texture classification,"Adel Hafiane, Kannappan Palaniappan, Guna Seetharaman, ","Pattern Recognition, Volume 48, Issue 8, August 2015, Pages 2609-2620, ","This paper addresses the challenging problem of the recognition and classification of textured surfaces given a single instance acquired under unknown pose, scale and illumination conditions. We propose a novel texture descriptor, the Adaptive Median Binary Pattern (AMBP) based on an adaptive analysis window of local patterns. The principal idea of the AMBP is to convert a small local image patch to a binary pattern using adaptive threshold selection that switches between the central pixel value as used in the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and the median as in Median Binary Pattern (MBP), but within a variable sized analysis window depending on the local microstructure of the texture. The variability of the local adaptive window is included as joint information to increase the discriminative properties. A new multiscale scheme is also proposed in this paper to handle the texture resolution problem. AMBP is evaluated in relation to other recent binary pattern techniques and many other texture analysis methods on three large texture corpora with and without noise added, CUReT, Outex_TC00012 and KTH_TIPS2. Generally, the proposed method performs better than the best state-of-the-art techniques in the noiseless case and significantly outperforms all of them in the presence of impulse noise."
Recent progress in surface coating of layered LiNixCoyMnzO2 for lithium-ion batteries,"Zhen Chen, Dongliang Chao, Jianyi Lin, Zexiang Shen, ","Materials Research Bulletin, Volume 96, Part 4, December 2017, Pages 491-502, ","Layered LiNixCoyMnzO2 exhibits high capacity and energy density with low cost for lithium-ion batteries. However, the poor rate capability and strong capacity fading with prolonged cycles, which are mainly attributed to undesired side reactions at the interface between electrode and electrolyte, plague its practical applications. Surface coating is a facile and feasible strategy to address these problems. An ideal coating layer can prohibit these side reactions via acting like a physical protection barrier to avoid the direct contact with reactive electrolyte, leading to suppressed transition metals＊ dissolution, oxygen loss, phase transformation and safety issues. The ionic/electronic conductivity, structural and thermal stability can be manipulated by careful selection of coating materials.

Effects of roughness and permeability on solute transfer at the sediment water interface,"Xu Han, Hongwei Fang, Guojian He, Danny Reible, ","Water Research, Volume 129, 1 February 2018, Pages 39-50, ","Understanding the mechanisms of solute transfer across the sediment-water interface plays a crucial role in water quality prediction and management. In this study, different arranged particles are used to form typical rough and permeable beds. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to model the solute transfer from the overlying water to sediment beds. Three rough wall turbulence regimes, i.e., smooth, transitional and rough regime, are separately considered and the effects of bed roughness on solute transfer are quantitatively analyzed. Results show that the classic laws related to Schmidt numbers can well reflect the solute transfer under the smooth regime with small roughness Reynolds numbers. Under the transitional regime, the solute transfer coefficient (KL+) is enhanced and the effect of Schmidt number is weakened by increasing roughness Reynolds number. Under the rough regime, the solute transfer is suppressed by the transition layer (Brinkman layer) and controlled by the bed permeability. Moreover, it is found that water depth, friction velocity and bed permeability can be used to estimate the solute transfer velocity (KL) under the completely rough regime.Download high-res image (234KB)Download full-size image"

Generalized Choquet fuzzy integral fusion,"Sansanee Auephanwiriyakul, James M Keller, Paul D Gader, ","Information Fusion, Volume 3, Issue 1, March 2002, Pages 69-85, ","Sensor fusion plays an important role in many application domains. No single source of information (decision or feature) can provide the absolute solution when detection and recognition problems become more complex and computationally expensive (e.g., in land mine detection). However, complementary information can be derived from multiple sources. In this paper, we build a decision-based fusion system based on the uncertainty approach utilizing an extension of the Choquet fuzzy integral (generalized Choquet fuzzy integral, GCFI). The difference between the standard Choquet fuzzy integral and the GCFI is that the GCFI integrates vectors of fuzzy numbers instead of vectors of numeric membership values. The system is applied to a land mine detection problem. The fuzzy vectors represent uncertainty in both the confidence and location estimates of several detection algorithm outputs. The results show a huge improvement in the probability of detection and a reduction in the false alarm rate over the best algorithm and two numeric fusion schemes, i.e., the average confidence and a decision level fusion with the numeric Choquet fuzzy integral. The GCFI obtains 100% probability of detection at 0.02 false alarm rate per square meter on a large test set, whereas the best detection algorithm and the average confidence achieve only 91% and 96% probability of detection at that rate. Additionally, at 0.02 false alarm rate, decision level fusion with the numeric Choquet fuzzy integral reaches only 87% probability of detection."

Different effects of monoamine oxidase inhibition on MPTP depletion of heart and brain catecholamines in mice,"Ray W. Fuller, Susan K. Hemrick-Luecke, M. Victoria Kindt, Richard E. Heikkila, ","Life Sciences, Volume 42, Issue 3, 1988, Pages 263-271, ","Pargyline, an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B), did not prevent the depletion of heart norepinephrine 24 hr after a single dose of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) in mice. In mice killed 24 hr after the last of 4 daily doses of MPTP, the depletion of dopamine in the striatum and of norepinephrine in the frontal cortex was completely prevented by pargyline, but the depletion of heart norepinephrine was not prevented. These results with pargyline are the same as results obtained earlier with deprenyl, another selective inhibitor of MAO-B. The doses of pargyline and of deprenyl that were used resulted in almost complete inhibition of MAO-B activity (phenylethylamine as substrate) in brain, heart and liver of mice. Deprenyl did not inhibit MAO-A activity (serotonin as substrate) in brain, but pargyline caused some inhibition of MAO-A in brain. In heart and liver, serotonin was oxidized only at about 110 the rate of phenylethylamine oxidation, suggesting that MAO-B predominates in these tissues. Both pargyline and deprenyl caused some inhibition of serotonin deamination in heart and liver, suggesting that the oxidation may have been due partly to MAO-B. Experiments with selective MAO inhibitors invitro showed that only about 20% of the oxidation of serotonin was occuring via MAO-B in heart and liver. The invitro oxidation of MPTP by MAO in mouse brain, heart and liver was almost completely inhibited by pretreatment with either pargyline or deprenyl. Neither pargyline nor deprenyl had any significant effect on the concentrations of MPTP in brain or heart one-half hr after injection of MPTP into mice. The concentrations of the metabolite, MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium), were markedly reduced in brain and in heart by pretreatment with either pargyline or deprenyl. The data suggest that MPP+ formation, which is necessary for the depletion of brain catecholamines after MPTP injection, may not be necessary for depletion of norepinephrine in heart. Since the oxidation of MPTP invitro was inhibited more by pargyline or deprenyl pretreatment than was the appearance of MPP+ invivo, the possibility exists that some MPP+ formation might occur by an enzyme other than MAO."

Assessment of miscible light-hydrocarbon-injection recovery efficiency in Bakken shale formation using wireline-log-derived indices,"Hao Li, Siddharth Misra, ","Marine and Petroleum Geology, Volume 89, Part 3, January 2018, Pages 585-593, ","High original oil-in-place estimates accompanied by low primary recovery potential of organic-rich shale formations make them suitable candidates for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects. The organic-rich shale formation under investigation in this paper is the Bakken shale formation that exhibits significant variations in lithology, rock texture, clay content, porosity, and total organic carbon (TOC). Three wireline-log-derived EOR-efficiency indices are generated across the 200-feet-thick Upper, Middle, and Lower Bakken formations to identify flow units suitable for EOR using light, miscible hydrocarbon injection.R-index is one of the three EOR-efficiency indices. R-index is calculated using kerogen content, water saturation, permeability, principal pore throat diameter, and porosity. Microscopic Displacement (MD) Index computes the microscopic displacement efficiency for the miscible gas injection. An important step in computing MD-index is to decompose NMR T2 distribution at each depth using factor analysis to compute the free oil, movable water, and bound fluid volumes. Moreover, the MD-index accounts for the effect of pore confinement on miscible oil volume and the effect kerogen content on the displacement efficiency. MD-index relies on a novel method to calculate the miscible free-oil volume from subsurface NMR T2-distribution logs. Lastly, k-means clustering method was used to generate the third index, referred as the KC-index, which is in the form of a step-wise curve. KC-index partitions the entire formation into four groups, representing miscible-gas-injection recovery potentials at discrete levels. The method uses water saturation, porosity, permeability, bound fluid volume, and principal pore throat diameter derived from various logs.The proposed log-derived EOR-efficiency indices generate consistent predictions of miscible light-hydrocarbon injection performance in the Bakken shale formation at various resolutions. Indices indicate that several formation zones in the middle section of the formation will have much higher recovery potential in comparison to the upper and lower sections of the formation. At a resolution of 1-foot depth interval, several flow units were successfully identified in the middle section that exhibit high miscible-gas-injection recovery potential."

Sensitivity of ozone concentrations to rate constants in a modified SAPRC90 chemical mechanism used for Canadian lower Fraser Valley ozone studies,"Weimin Jiang, Donald L. Singleton, Robert Mclaren, Mark Hedley, ","Atmospheric Environment, Volume 31, Issue 8, April 1997, Pages 1195-1208, ","The SAPRC90 chemical mechanism implemented in CALGRID is modified and updated for the specific emissions and applications of the Lower Fraser Valley (LFV) of British Columbia, Canada. Explicit reactions related to biogenic emissions and alternative fuels are added. The sensitivity of ozone formation to rate parameters in the mechanism is determined for an episode specific trajectory which originates under relatively clean marine conditions and passes over the urban core of Vancouver during the morning rush hour. Of the 137 reactions in the modified mechanism, the rate constants of 44 reactions are found to have a high sensitivity on ozone formation. The 44 reactions are further divided into general sensitive reactions, for which rate constant changes near the base case values have observable effects on maximum ozone concentrations, and limit-sensitive reactions, for which rate constant changes of more than an order of magnitude are required to have an observable impact on ozone concentrations. For the sensitive reactions, both ozone sensitivity coefficients for small changes (20%) in the rate constants and effects on ozone caused by large rate constant changes (factors of 0, 0.5, and 2) are calculated. Of note is the importance of several photolysis reactions and the reactions of OH with a class of reactive aromatics, including xylenes, on ozone concentrations in the LFV."
Impaired Natural Killer Cell Lysis in Breast Cancer Patients with High Levels of Psychological Stress is Associated with Altered Expression of Killer Immunoglobin-Like Receptors,"Kimberly A. Varker, Catherine E. Terrell, Marilyn Welt, Samer Suleiman, William E. Carson, ","Journal of Surgical Research, Volume 139, Issue 1, 1 May 2007, Pages 36-44, ","We previously reported that cancer-related psychological stress is associated with reduced natural killer (NK) cell lysis. We hypothesized that reduced NK cell cytotoxicity in patients with increased levels of stress would correlate with alterations in the expression of inhibitory NK cell receptors (killer immunoglobulin-like receptors, or KIRs). The specific aim of this study was to examine KIR expression in patients with high or low levels of psychologic stress and correlate alterations in KIR expression with NK cell function.Two hundred twenty-seven patients underwent baseline evaluation of cancer-related psychological stress and were randomized to psychosocial intervention versus observation. From this population, two groups were defined based on pretreatment measurements of NK lytic activity, stress levels, and the availability of cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Group I (n = 9) had low stress by the Impact of Events Scale (IES), and high NK cell lysis at the 50:1 effector: target ratio (NK50 = 52每89%). Group II (n = 8) had high stress and low NK50 (27每52%). Lymphokine activated killer (LAK) activity, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and expression of cytokine receptors, adhesion molecules, and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) were assessed in PBMC.Incubation of PBMC with NK-stimulatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, or IL-15) led to significant increases in cytotoxic activity regardless of IES/NK50 scores. There were no significant group differences in NK cell surface expression of the IL-2 receptor components CD25 and CD122, antibody-dependent lysis of HER2/neu-positive SKBr3 cells treated with an anti-HER2/neu monoclonal antibody, expression of adhesion molecules (CD2, CD11a, CD18) and markers of activation (CD69), or expression of the KIRs CD158a, NKG2a, NKB1, and CD161. However, levels of CD158b were significantly higher in Group I after incubation in media alone or with IL-2, and CD94 expression was significantly lower in Group I after incubation with IL-2.In this study of a small subset of breast cancer patients chosen from a previous clinical trial of psychosocial intervention for breast cancer, impaired NK lysis in breast cancer patients with high levels of psychological stress was associated with alterations in surface expression of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors. However, immune effectors retained the ability to lyse antibody-coated targets and to initiate lymphokine-activated killer activity, irrespective of stress levels or baseline NK50."
Sensitivity Analysis of a Simulation Model of Bird-Insect Interactions in a Deciduous Forest Ecosystem,"Brian A. Maurer, ","Developments in Environmental Modelling, Volume 5, 1983, Pages 277-287, ","A simulation model of biomass changes in a bird-insect system in a deciduous forest was constructed. The major compartments of the model were deciduous leaves, leaf-eating insects, and 15 species of insectivorous birds. Additional compartments representing alternate prey sources were also included. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine which parameters were important in determining the dynamics of the model. Variations of initial inputs into several compartments allowed an assessment of the importance of initial conditions. Simulation results identified 2 key parameters. The major controlling factor of insect populations was the value of a density dependent biomass removal parameter. Bird predation was insignificant in controlling the dynamics of insect populations. The major factor controlling growth of bird populations was insect densities and a parameter relating biomass intake to the difficulty of obtaining prey. Thus, though growth rates of birds were sensitive to prey population levels, insect growth rates were only slightly affected by bird predation. The model was robust to large variations in initial conditions. The dynamics of the model suggest that birds in deciduous forests may not be subject to exploitative competition."

However, to make face authentication suitable for web services, there are still several critical security and privacy challenges unaddressed. First, the existing authentication servers typically collect the plaintext of users' facial images in order to conduct authentication. If the servers are compromised, the attackers would obtain the users' facial images and can easily impersonate the users in any other applications that use face authentication. Second, it is also hard to prevent attackers from using facial images published in social network sites to impersonate the true user. In this paper, we conquered these two issues by proposing a novel secure face authentication system, called UFace. UFace uses special close-up facial images (which cannot be found online) for authentication. To further ensure the confidentiality of these close-up images, UFace guarantees that these images are only stored at user side and the servers have not any plaintext of these images. The face authentication is conducted securely with two collaborative authentication servers. UFace was implemented through both an Android application and multiple server side programs which were then evaluated in a real setting. The experimental results demonstrate that the UFace system can accurately authenticate users within a few seconds."

Bone changes in ridge split with immediate implant placement: A systematic review,"Mohamed M. Dohiem, Hossam I. Nassar, Hussein El Charkawi, ","Future Dental Journal, Volume 1, Issue 1, December 2015, Pages 6-12, ","Alveolar width deficiency represents loss of buccal cortical or/and medullary bone. Deficiency of the buccal represents significant difficulty in implant reconstruction. A variety of implant-driven bone augmentation techniques for the deficient alveolar bone have been proposed. Alveolar ridge split is an excellent tool for regaining alveolar ridge width.Publications on the subject in English were searched to select articles up to June 2015. A systematic review was conducted searching an electronic database (MEDLINE, Pub- Med and Cochran) for articles in pre-reviewed journals concerning studies on humans. Two independent reviewers screened 815 papers.A consensus on the studies to be selected was reached after discussion; 804 articles were excluded on the basis of the title and abstract. Kappa score for the selection of the paper was 0.89. Full-text articles were obtained for the 11 selected publications. The 11 full texts were independently assessed by the two reviewers and 3 studies were found to qualify for inclusion.Alveolar ridge splitting might be considered a predictable approach that demonstrates a high implant survival rate, adequate horizontal bone gain and minimal postoperative complications. Weak evidence showed the effect of flap design and immediate implantation on marginal bone loss and survival rate."

These ligands, and the known isopropyl derivative ProboxiPr, react with [PdCl2(NCPh)2] and [RhCl(灰2-C8H14)2]2 to form 16-membered bimetallic macrocycles. Additionally, ProboxMe2 and RhCl3 react to form a new monoanionic NCN-type pincer complex (百3-N,C,N-ProboxMe2)RhCl2. The structures of new palladium and rhodium macrocycles with the Probox ligands are confirmed by X-ray crystallography, and natural abundance 15N 2D NMR experiments prove oxazoline coordination to the metal centers in solution. Addition of a weakly donating water ligand to (百3-N,C,N-ProboxMe2)RhCl2 gives a six-coordinate compound with a mer-Probox configuration, whereas PMe3 coordination provides a single fac coordinated Probox isomer.Chiral and achiral 1,3-bis(oxazolinyl)propane (Probox) ligands react with [PdCl2(NCPh)2] and [RhCl(灰2-C8H14)2]2 providing 16-membered macrocycles.

No significant association was found in the entire sample or when stratifying by transmitting parent, indicating that this gene plays little or no role in susceptibility to MS in the Canadian population."
Spinal cord ischemia may be reduced via a novel technique of intercostal artery revascularization during open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair,"Edward Y. Woo, Michael Mcgarvey, Benjamin M. Jackson, Joseph E. Bavaria, Albert Pochettino, ","Journal of Vascular Surgery, Volume 46, Issue 3, September 2007, Pages 421-426, ","To describe a novel technique for maximal reimplantation of intercostal arteries during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.Eight patients underwent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair with this new technique from 2005 to 2006. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 14 months. All patients had a previous type B dissection with subsequent aneurysmal degeneration into an extent I TAAA. Aneurysm repair was performed through a thoracoabdominal incision and circulatory arrest in seven and left atrial-left femoral (LA-FA) bypass in one. The grafts extended from the distal arch at the subclavian artery to the visceral and renal arteries. An 8 mm graft was then extended from the proximal to the distal graft with a spatulation of the graft allowing a side-to-side anastomosis of the graft to the posterior aortic wall incorporating multiple pairs of intercostal arteries. Intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were monitored during each operation.All patients were ambulatory at the time of admission. One patient had suffered a previous spinal cord infarction from the original dissection and had residual unilateral leg weakness prior to the TAAA repair. There was an average of seven pairs of patent intercostal arteries upon opening the aorta. We reimplanted an average of five pairs of vessels. There were no perioperative complications. No patients sustained transient or permanent paraplegia in the postoperative or follow-up period. The one patient with preoperative leg weakness had reported subjective increased strength in the affected leg after the operation. In four cases, normalization of SSEP waveforms did not occur until after reimplantation of the intercostal arteries despite full return of EEG waveforms, restoration of lower extremity perfusion, and rewarming of the patient. Follow-up CT scan angiogram demonstrated that all reconstructions were patent through the follow-up period.Paraplegia is an extremely morbid complication associated with TAAA repair. We describe a technique that allows reimplantation of almost all intercostal arteries as one patch circumventing the need for selective reimplantation. Furthermore, our technique ensures continued patency of this patch graft as the outflow resistance is decreased by creating a continuous flow loop. Although this is a small case series, we had no incidence of acute or delayed paraplegia in this high risk group. Our technique of intercostal reimplantation is applicable to all open TAAA repair at high-risk for paraplegia and may be an important adjunct in preventing spinal cord ischemia."
Vascular distribution of stroke and its relationship to perioperative mortality and neurologic outcome after thoracic endovascular aortic repair,"Brant W. Ullery, Michael McGarvey, Albert T. Cheung, Ronald M. Fairman, Grace J. Wang, ","Journal of Vascular Surgery, Volume 56, Issue 6, December 2012, Pages 1510-1517, ","This study assessed the vascular distribution of stroke after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and its relationship to perioperative death and neurologic outcome.A retrospective review was performed for patients undergoing TEVAR between 2001 and 2010. Aortic arch hybrid and abdominal debranching cases were excluded. Demographics, operative variables, and neurologic complications were examined. Stroke was defined as any new focal or global neurologic deficit lasting >24 hours with radiographic confirmation of acute intracranial pathology.Perioperative stroke occurred in 20 of 530 patients (3.8%) undergoing TEVAR. The cohort was 55% male and a mean age of 75.2 ㊣ 8.9 years (range, 57-90 years). Among patients with perioperative strokes, the indication for surgery was degenerative aneurysm in 14 (mean diameter, 6.8 cm), acute type B dissection in four, penetrating atherosclerotic aneurysm in one, and aortic transection in one. Cases were performed urgently or as an emergency in 60%. The proximal landing zone was zone 2 in 11 or zone 3 in nine. All strokes were embolic. The vascular distribution of stroke involved the anterior cerebral (AC) circulation in eight (zone 2, n = 5) and the posterior cerebral (PC) circulation in 12 (zone 2, n = 6). Laterality of cerebral infarction included five right-sided, eight left-sided, and seven bilateral strokes. Nine strokes were diagnosed <24 hours after operation. There was no difference in baseline demographics, aortic pathology, acuity, zone coverage, preoperative left subclavian artery revascularization, number of stents, or estimated blood loss between stroke groups based on vascular distribution. Independent risk factors for any perioperative stroke were chronic renal insufficiency (odds ratios [OR], 4.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-17.7; P = .02) and history of prior stroke (OR, 4.92; 95% CI, 1.69-14.4; P = .004); the risk factor for AC stroke was prior stroke (OR, 7.67; 95% CI, 1.25-46.9; P = .03) and the risk factors for PC stroke were age (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00-1.23; P = .04), prior stroke (OR, 7.53; 95% CI, 1.78-31.8; P = .006), zone 2 coverage (OR, 6.11; 95% CI, 1.15-32.3; P = .03), and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (OR, 32.7; 95% CI, 1.33-807.2; P = .03). Overall in-hospital mortality was 20% (n = 4), with those sustaining PC strokes observed to trend toward increased mortality (33% vs 0%; P = .12). Patients with AC strokes were more likely than those with PC strokes to achieve complete recovery of neurologic deficits before discharge (75% vs 17%; P = .02).Perioperative stroke after TEVAR is primarily an embolic event. Although infrequent, stroke was associated with significant morbidity and death, particularly among those with strokes involving the PC circulation."

In addition, the presence of hopelessness and somatic complaints was examined, to determine their relevance to depression. Using Wave 1 data from Duke University＊s contribution in the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study, we created a mathematical model, a neural network, to map the relationship of nine symptoms of major depression, hopelessness and somatic complaints to the presence or absence of the formal diagnosis of depression, and performed a contribution analysis. The contribution analysis using the neural network revealed that the symptoms with the greatest impact on the occurrence of depression, or with the largest importance number for depression, were sadness, loss of interest, tiredness and sleeping trouble, in that order. The most frequently reported symptoms, though, were sadness, sleeping trouble, suicidal ideation, tiredness and poor concentration, in that order. Hopelessness and somatic symptoms were the lowest in their contribution to the diagnosis of depression. The study thus provides the hierarchy of the symptoms of depression and supports the DSM classification of major depression."

Tralokinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that neutralises interleukin 13. We aimed to evaluate whether tralokinumab would have an effect on airway eosinophilic infiltration, blood and sputum eosinophil concentrations, eosinophil activation, and airway remodelling.We did a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at 15 centres across the UK, Denmark, and Canada. We enrolled participants of either sex aged 18每75 years with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe asthma for 12 months or more, requiring treatment with inhaled corticosteroids at a stable dose. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive tralokinumab (300 mg) or placebo by an interactive web-based system or voice response system. Participants and study personnel were masked to treatment allocation. Both tralokinumab and placebo were administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 12 in bronchial biopsy eosinophil count. Secondary outcome measures included change in blood and sputum eosinophil counts. Exploratory outcomes included fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) and blood IgE concentrations. Safety analyses were carried out in all participants who received study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02449473, and with the European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT 2015-000857-19.Between Sept 25, 2015, and June 21, 2017, 224 participants were enrolled and screened. Of these participants, 79 were randomly assigned to receive tralokinumab (n=39) or placebo (n=40). Tralokinumab did not significantly affect bronchial eosinophil count compared with placebo at week 12 (treatment effect ratio 1﹞43, 95% CI 0﹞63每3﹞27; p=0﹞39). Compared with placebo, tralokinumab did not significantly affect blood eosinophil count (treatment effect ratio 1﹞21, 95% CI 1﹞00每1﹞48; p=0﹞055) or sputum eosinophil count (0﹞57, 0﹞06每6﹞00; p=0﹞63), but FENO concentration (0﹞78, 0﹞63每0﹞96; p=0﹞023) and total blood IgE concentration (0﹞86, 0﹞77每0﹞97; p=0﹞014) were significantly reduced. 33 (85%) of 39 patients receiving tralokinumab and 32 (80%) of 40 receiving placebo reported at least one adverse event during the treatment period. No deaths in either treatment group were observed. Treatment-related adverse events occurred more frequently in the tralokinumab group than in the placebo group (11 [28%] of 39 vs seven [18%] of 40).Tralokinumab did not significantly affect eosinophilic inflammation in bronchial submucosa, blood, or sputum compared with placebo, but did reduce FENO and IgE concentrations. These results suggest interleukin 13 is not crucial for eosinophilic airway inflammation control in moderate-to-severe asthma.AstraZeneca."

Here, we investigated whether or not CMA influences the subsequent risk to develop MS in a population-based cohort. We identified 6638 MS index cases and 2509 spousal controls with CMA information from the Canadian Collaborative Project on Genetic Susceptibility to MS (CCPGSMS). Frequency of CMA was compared between index cases and controls. No significant differences were found. Childhood CMA thus does not appear to be a risk factor for MS."
Analysis of the AGV loading capacity in a JIT environment,"Luis G. Occena, Toshiya Yokota, ","Journal of Manufacturing Systems, Volume 12, Issue 1, 1993, Pages 24-35, ","The problem of transport performance is inherent in just-in-time (JIT) systems where lot sizes are smaller. When the lot size is made smaller to keep inventory low, the number of delivery trips to replenish materials increases, which affects the transport performance. This situation will intensify with increased throughput requirements, as more parts move through the system in the same period of time. Adapting an automated guided vehicle (AGV) to carry multiple loads is an appealing alternative to increasing the number of single-load AGVs in a JIT system. A multiple-load AGV (MLAGV) will not increase traffic congestion, but will require a more sophisticated AGV system (AGVS) model to ensure just-in-time delivery. This paper extends the authors' previous work on modeling an AGVS in a JIT environment. It examines the alternative of using a MLAGV to meet higher throughput requirements in a JIT manufacturing system. Computer simulation was used to evaluate the effects of multiple loads on both transport and logistic performance. The results provide a useful guide in the design of MLAGV systems, particularly in manufacturing environments with low inventory and high throughput requirements."

Selected variables were chosen for a back-propagation neural network model and for subsequent sensitivity and statistical analysis.Sensitive adolescents and adolescents with less impulse control scored high on hopelessness. Forceful adolescents were less hopeless. Conclusions: Using the neural network models, the authors suggest that assertive training as well as group activities that increase cooperativeness may ameliorate hopelessness."
An effective hybrid biogeography-based optimization algorithm for the distributed assembly permutation flow-shop scheduling problem,"Jian Lin, Shuai Zhang, ","Computers & Industrial Engineering, Volume 97, July 2016, Pages 128-136, ","Distributed assembly permutation flow-shop scheduling problem (DAPFSP) is widely exists in modern supply chains and manufacturing systems. In this paper, an effective hybrid biogeography-based optimization (HBBO) algorithm that integrates several novel heuristics is proposed to solve the DAPFSP with the objective of minimizing the makespan. Firstly, the path relinking heuristic is employed in the migration phase as product local search strategy to optimize the assembly sequence. Secondly, an insertion-based heuristic is used in the mutation phase to determine the job permutation for each product. Then, a novel local search method is designed based on the problem characteristics and embedded in the HBBO scheme to further improve the most promising individual. Finally, computational simulations on 900 small-sized instances and 810 large-sized instances are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and the new best known solutions for 162 instances are found."

Instead, we find that the relative wage of unskilled female to male workers was higher than their relative productivity. This result indicates that unskilled female workers in the state sector had historically received wage premiums and consequently accounted for a disproportionate share of the sector's labor surplus."
Mechanisms of glucagon degradation at alkaline pH,"Nicholas Caputo, Jessica R. Castle, Colin P. Bergstrom, Julie M. Carroll, W. Kenneth Ward, ","Peptides, Volume 45, July 2013, Pages 40-47, ","Glucagon is unstable and undergoes degradation and aggregation in aqueous solution. For this reason, its use in portable pumps for closed loop management of diabetes is limited to very short periods. In this study, we sought to identify the degradation mechanisms and the bioactivity of specific degradation products. We studied degradation in the alkaline range, a range at which aggregation is minimized. Native glucagon and analogs identical to glucagon degradation products were synthesized. To quantify biological activity in glucagon and in the degradation peptides, a protein kinase A-based bioassay was used. Aged, fresh, and modified peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LCMS). Oxidation of glucagon at the Met residue was common but did not reduce bioactivity. Deamidation and isomerization were also common and were more prevalent at pH 10 than 9. The biological effects of deamidation and isomerization were unpredictable; deamidation at some sites did not reduce bioactivity. Deamidation of Gln 3, isomerization of Asp 9, and deamidation with isomerization at Asn 28 all caused marked potency loss. Studies with molecular-weight-cutoff membranes and LCMS revealed much greater fibrillation at pH 9 than 10. Further work is necessary to determine formulations of glucagon that minimize degradation and fibrillation."

This has become more important with the advent of assisted reproductive technologies, because individuals previously thought to be infertile can now become biological parents. Indeed, there are several recent reports of successful pregnancies involving 47,XXY fathers, and suggestions that cryopreservation of ovarian tissue might impart fertility to at least some Turner syndrome individuals. Thus, the possible consequences of sex chromosome aneuploidy on meiotic chromosome segregation need to be explored."

They have been used for image segmentation, pattern recognition, and general multicriteria decision-making. One of the drawbacks of these networks is that the training is complex and quite time consuming. We have recently modified these aggregation networks to implement additive fuzzy hybrid connectives. These new networks have similar excellent properties for decision-making under uncertainty as do their multiplicative precursors, and have the advantage that training is easier since the additive operators are not as complex in form.In earlier work, trainable neural networks have been used to perform inference in a fuzzy logic system. Fixed-architecture networks of fuzzy operators and standard neural networks have been utilized. The additive hybrid operators are extremely flexible and so, are excellent candidates for nodes in a network structure for fuzzy logic inference. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the capability of networks of additive hybrid nodes to learn appropriate functional relationships for fuzzy logic. An added advantage of these networks is that they are transparent, i.e., after training, the individual nodes can be analyzed as a collection of ※mini-rules§."

IDH2 deficiency impairs mitochondrial function in endothelial cells and endothelium-dependent vasomotor function,"Jung-Bum Park, Harsha Nagar, Sujeong Choi, Saet-byel Jung, Cuk-Seong Kim, ","Free Radical Biology and Medicine, Volume 94, May 2016, Pages 36-46, ","Mitochondrial NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) plays an essential role protecting cells against oxidative stress-induced damage. A deficiency in IDH2 leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiomyocytes and cancer cells. However, the function of IDH2 in vascular endothelial cells is mostly unknown. In this study the effects of IDH2 deficiency on mitochondrial and vascular function were investigated in endothelial cells. IDH2 knockdown decreased the expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, II and III, which lead to increased mitochondrial superoxide. In addition, the levels of fission and fusion proteins (Mfn-1, OPA-1, and Drp-1) were significantly altered and MnSOD expression also was decreased by IDH2 knockdown. Furthermore, knockdown of IDH2 decreased eNOS phosphorylation and nitric oxide (NO) concentration in endothelial cells. Interestingly, treatment with Mito-TEMPO, a mitochondrial-specific superoxide scavenger, recovered mitochondrial fission每fusion imbalance and blunted mitochondrial superoxide production, and reduced the IDH2 knockdown-induced decrease in MnSOD expression, eNOS phosphorylation and NO production in endothelial cells. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was impaired, and the concentration of bioavailable NO decreased in the aortic ring in IDH2 knockout mice. These findings suggest that IDH2 deficiency induces endothelial dysfunction through the induction of dynamic mitochondrial changes and impairment in vascular function.Download high-res image (163KB)Download full-size image"

A computer model and program for xenobiotic disposition during pregnancy,"Richard H Luecke, Walter D Wosilait, Bruce A Pearce, John F Young, ","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, Volume 53, Issue 3, July 1997, Pages 201-224, ","A physiologically based pharmacokinetic computer model and program have been developed that depict internal disposition of chemicals during pregnancy in the mother and embryo/fetus. The model is based on human physiology but has been extended to simulate laboratory animal data. The model represents the distribution, metabolism, and elimination of two chemicals in both the maternal and embryo/fetal systems; the program handles the two chemicals completely independently or interactively with the two chemicals sharing routes of metabolism and/or elimination. The FORTRAN program computes the concentration of the two chemicals in 26 organs/tissues in the pregnant mother and 15 organs/tissues in the embryo/fetus using a 486DX4 or Pentium PC. Adjustments for embryo/fetal organ and tissue volumes as a function of developmental age are made utilizing the Gompertz growth equation for the developing embryo/fetus and allometric relationships for the developing organs. Various changes in the maternal compartments which could affect the distribution of a xenobiotic during pregnancy are also included in the model. Input files require estimates of binding coefficients, first- and/or second-order metabolism constants, level of interaction between the two chemicals, and dosing information. Different possible routes of administration are included (e.g., i.v., infusion, oral, dermal, and inhalation, as well as repeated doses or exposures). Regression analysis can be conducted on any combination of these various parameters to fit actual data. Output concentration-time curves are available simultaneously from all 82 differential equations. An illustrative example compares observed data with simulations for imipramine and its demethylated metabolite, desipramine, in both the maternal rat and her fetuses. Methyl mercury data for the non-pregnant and pregnant rat also are compared with human data. Based on parameters determined from analysis of rat data, the model is readjusted for human physiology and predicts human maternal and fetal tissue concentrations as a function of time."
Crystal structure of the D85S mutant of bacteriorhodopsin: model of an O-like photocycle intermediate,"Shahab Rouhani, Jean-Philippe Cartailler, Marc T Facciotti, Peter Walian, Hartmut Luecke, ","Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 313, Issue 3, 26 October 2001, Pages 615-628, ","Crystal structures are reported for the D85S and D85S/F219L mutants of the light-driven proton/hydroxyl-pump bacteriorhodopsin. These mutants crystallize in the orthorhombic C2221 spacegroup, and provide the first demonstration that monoolein-based cubic lipid phase crystallization can support the growth of well-diffracting crystals in non-hexagonal spacegroups. Both structures exhibit similar and substantial differences relative to wild-type bacteriorhodopsin, suggesting that they represent inherent features resulting from neutralization of the Schiff base counterion Asp85. We argue that these structures provide a model for the last photocycle intermediate (O) of bacteriorhodopsin, in which Asp85 is protonated, the proton release group is deprotonated, and the retinal has reisomerized to all-trans. Unlike for the M and N photointermediates, where structural changes occur mainly on the cytoplasmic side, here the large-scale changes are confined to the extracellular side. As in the M intermediate, the side-chain of Arg82 is in a downward configuration, and in addition, a 羽-cloud hydrogen bond forms between Trp189 NE1 and Trp138. On the cytoplasmic side, there is increased hydration near the surface, suggesting how Asp96 might communicate with the bulk during the rise of the O intermediate."

The active drug was significantly more effective than the placebo. After 4 weeks, patients on the drug treatment had significantly lower anxiety on two of the measures. Two neural networks were trained with gender, history of depression, agoraphobia, readiness to change, and five anxiety measures at baseline data as inputs, and the five anxiety measures 4 weeks later as outputs. The five anxiety measures were the Clinical Anxiety Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the number of panic attacks, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, and the Phobia Severity Scale. The networks were validated and sensitivity analyses showed that, in agreement with the stages of change model, patients with low predisposition to change (Precontemplators) changed more slowly than those in Contemplation or Action stages of change."

Dynamic Real-Time Optimization of Distributed MPC Systems Using Rigorous Closed-Loop Prediction,"Hao Li, Christopher L. E. Swartz, ","Computers & Chemical Engineering, In press, accepted manuscript, Available online 28 August 2018, ","A dynamic real-time optimization (DRTO) formulation with closed-loop prediction is used to coordinate distributed model predictive controllers (MPCs) by rigorously predicting the interaction between the distributed MPCs and full plant response in the DRTO formulation. This results a multi-level optimization problem that is solved by replacing the MPC quadratic programming subproblems by their equivalent Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) first-order optimality conditions to yield a single-level mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). The proposed formulation is able to perform both target tracking and economic optimization with significant performance improvement over decentralized control, and similar performance to centralized MPC. A linear dynamic case study illustrates the performance of the proposed strategy for coordination of distributed MPCs for different levels of plant interaction. The method is thereafter applied to a nonlinear integrated plant with recycle, where its performance in both set-point target tracking and economic optimization is demonstrated."
Sensitivity of ozone concentrations to VOC and NOx emissions in the Canadian Lower Fraser Valley,"Weimin Jiang, Donald L. Singleton, Mark Hedley, Robert McLaren, ","Atmospheric Environment, Volume 31, Issue 4, February 1997, Pages 627-638, ","The SAPRC90 chemical mechanism module implemented in CALGRID is updated for the specific emissions and applications of the Lower Fraser Valley (LFV) of British Columbia, Canada. The kinetic and mechanistic parameters of lumped VOC reactions recalculated using the LFV emissions profiles are noticeably different from those based on default emissions profiles, indicating the importance of tailoring the parameters to specific regions. The sensitivities of ozone concentrations to total and speciated VOC and NOx emissions as well as to the NO2NOx ratios are determined. Significant VOC model species are identified based on the impact of their emissions on ozone formation in the LFV. Of note is the importance of the emissions of a lumped class of aromatics, ARO2, which contains mostly isomers of xylene and trimethylbenzene and is derived chiefly from the use and distribution of gasoline fuels. The ARO2 emissions make the largest contribution of all model VOC species to the ozone levels in the urban plume. The results indicate that reduction of AR02 emissions alone could achieve significant reduction of ozone levels in the LFV. Base case emissions of NOx(NO or NO2) in the LFV contribute negatively to the ozone formation. Any overestimation of NOx or underestimation of VOC in the emissions inventory could cause underestimations of ozone levels by photochemical models."
Impact of environmental tobacco smoke on the water adsorption capacity of desiccant materials,"Song-Yng Lee, Tushar K. Ghosh, Anthony L. Hines, Davor Novosel, ","Gas Separation & Purification, Volume 9, Issue 4, December 1995, Pages 285-291, ","The water adsorption capacity of desiccant materials may be affected significantly if particulates are present in the air that is to be processed. Air containing environmental tobacco smoke was used to study the effect of particulates. A smoking apparatus was designed by simulating the puffing of a cigarette by a person to generate environmental tobacco smoke. The apparatus can take a puff from a cigarette at 1 min intervals; one puff requires 2 s and entails drawing a total of 35 cm3 of air through the cigarette. The puffing process was controlled by a computer. The sidestream smoke generated during the idle burning of the cigarette in the 1 min interval between puffs was diluted with the room air to produce the environmental tobacco smoke and was used in all the experiments. Desiccants used in the present work included silica gel and molecular sieve 13X. Experiments were carried out under dynamic conditions using a packed bed adsorber at 298 K and at a relative humidity of ＞50%. The adsorption and regeneration cycles were repeated 15 times using the same adsorbent. Significant amounts of hydrocarbons and particulates were removed by both silica gel and the molecular sieve during the initial period of a run. The equilibrium water uptake capacity of silica gel at higher relative humidities decreased significantly after 15 cycles but that of the molecular sieve remained almost the same as that of a fresh sample. Also, a molecular sieve that was exposed to tobacco smoke could be regenerated at a lower temperature than the exposed silica gel."
Scaling of biological community structure: A systems approach to community complexity,"Brian A. Maurer, ","Journal of Theoretical Biology, Volume 127, Issue 1, 7 July 1987, Pages 97-110, ","Local community dynamics are determined by the interaction of environmental variation and the biotic properties of communities. This interaction occurs on many spatial and temporal scales, hence the expectation is that community dynamics will be complex. Previous theoretical approaches to communities have assumed linear, near equilibrium dynamics. An alternative approach suggests that community dynamics are the result of the balance between energy use by the community and its tendency to move towards thermodynamic equilibrium, in this case extinction of all species in the community. Because this balance will be imprecise, community dynamics should be oscillatory. Furthermore, because energy use by a community can be broken down into a hierarchical set of processes occurring on different time scales, community dynamics should reflect multiple periodicities. The above theoretical treatment suggests that since community dynamics are scaled, a hierarchical observational approach should help resolve important aspects of community structure. This approach of scaling community observations provides a technique for evaluation of community responses to environmental change, including human induced perturbations. A thermodynamic approach to community dynamics can also provide the basis for new theoretical and empirical discoveries about biological communities."

"Dipodomys populations as energy-processing systems: Regulation, competition, and hierarchical organization","Brian A. Maurer, ","Ecological Modelling, Volume 50, Issues 1每3, March 1990, Pages 157-176, ","The role of extrinsic and intrinsic factors in the regulation of population dynamics and community structure has been poorly understood. To address this question, an energetic model of population dynamics is developed for a system of two species of heteromyid rodents (Dipodomys spp.) using a single homogeneous seed resource. The model suggests that large-scale, extrinsic factors, such as climate, and intrinsic properties of individual organisms and populations interact to determine the observed community dynamics. Previous modelling approaches have confused organismic level processes, such as foraging, with population and community level processes, such as reproduction and competition. Systems approaches incorporating energetics and hierarchy theory should provide a more realistic basis for dealing with complex ecological systems such as populations and communities."

Binary linear programming models for robust broadcasting in communication networks,"Ronald G. McGarvey, Brian Q. Rieksts, Jos谷 A. Ventura, Namsu Ahn, ","Discrete Applied Mathematics, Volume 204, 11 May 2016, Pages 173-184, ","Broadcasting is an information dissemination process in communication networks whereby a message, originated at any node of a network, is transmitted to all other nodes of the network. In c-broadcasting, each node having the message completes up to c transmissions to its neighbors over the communication lines in one time unit. In a k-fault tolerant c-broadcast network, the broadcasting process can be accomplished even if k communication lines fail. This paper presents innovative binary linear programming formulations to construct c-broadcast graphs, k-fault-tolerant c-broadcast graphs, and their time-relaxed versions. The proposed mathematical models are used to generate eight previously unknown minimum c-broadcast graphs, new upper bounds for eleven other instances of the c-broadcast problem, and over 30 minimum k-fault-tolerant c-broadcast graphs. The paper also provides a construction method to produce an upper bound for an infinite family of k-fault-tolerant c-broadcast graphs."

Decision making using multiple models,"Manoj K. Malhotra, Subhash Sharma, Satish S.

In this paper, we propose a decision framework that combines multiple models or techniques in a complementary fashion to provide input to managers who make such decisions on a routine basis. We illustrate the framework by specifically using five different classification techniques 每 neural networks, discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and multinomial logistic regression analysis (MNL). Application of the decision framework to an actual retail department store data shows that it is most useful in those cases where uncertainty is high and a priori classification cannot be made with a high degree of reliability. The proposed framework thus enhances the value of exception reporting, and provides managers additional insights into the phenomenon being studied."
High performance force feedback mechanism for virtual reality training of endotracheal intubation,"Jonathan D. French, James H. Mutti, Satish S.

This allows the intubation force profiles to be superimposed onto the FFM weight compensation to complete the overall force feedback effort. The development of a mechanism of this type introduces several theoretical and experimental design challenges that are addressed in this paper."
A hybrid biogeography-based optimization for the fuzzy flexible job-shop scheduling problem,"Jian Lin, ","Knowledge-Based Systems, Volume 78, April 2015, Pages 59-74, ","Biogeography-based optimization is a novel evolutionary algorithm which mimics the immigration and emigration of species among habitats. In this paper, the biogeography-based optimization is combined with some heuristics to construct an effective hybrid algorithm for solving the fuzzy flexible job-shop scheduling problem. First, path relinking technique is employed as migration operation to generate a new solution. Then, an insertion-based local search heuristic is introduced and embedded in the biogeography-based optimization to modify the mutation operator. Moreover, an efficient machine assignment rule is also proposed to decode the representation based on the operation sequence. Consequently, the exploration and exploitation abilities of the hybrid algorithm are enhanced and well balanced. Computational results and the comparisons with some existing algorithms are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid scheme."

Using molecular data of 9,125 patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified tumor subtypes in 33 cancer types based on mRNA expression patterns of seven major metabolic processes and assessed their clinical relevance. Our metabolic expression subtypes correlated extensively with clinical outcome: subtypes with upregulated carbohydrate, nucleotide, and vitamin/cofactor metabolism most consistently correlated with worse prognosis, whereas subtypes with upregulated lipid metabolism showed the opposite. Metabolic subtypes correlated with diverse somatic drivers but exhibited effects convergent on cancer hallmark pathways and were modulated by highly recurrent master regulators across cancer types. As a proof-of-concept example, we demonstrated that knockdown of SNAI1 or RUNX1〞master regulators of carbohydrate metabolic subtypes〞modulates metabolic activity and drug sensitivity. Our study provides a system-level view of metabolic heterogeneity within and across cancer types and identifies pathway cross-talk, suggesting related prognostic, therapeutic, and predictive utility.Download high-res image (168KB)Download full-size image"

These toxins originate in marine dinoflagellates, including Dinophysis spp. Phytoplankton samples were collected from the southwest coast of Ireland and D. acuta was the predominant species. Monocultures of D. acuta cells were prepared by hand picking from microscope slides in order to confirm their toxin profiles. There was a remarkable consistency in the toxin profiles in all of the phytoplankton samples collected during the summer months, irrespective of location, depth or mesh size. Analysis using liquid chromatography〞multiple tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed that DTX2 and OA were the predominant toxins at a consistent ratio. The average toxin composition was: DTX2 (53㊣5%), OA (26.5㊣2.3%) and total pectenotoxins (20.8㊣4.7%).

To assess the natural history and treatment options in PD we have reviewed the experience at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI).Study Design: The medical records of patients treated for PD at RPCI between 1963 and 1996 were reviewed.Results: Eighty patients were treated in the period reviewed. The median follow up was 61 months. Sixty- eight of 80 patients had nipple changes consistent with PD including 30 who had an associated breast mass (group 1), and 38 who had no associated mass (group 2). Of the 68 patients with clinical PD, 58 (85%) were treated with mastectomy while the remainder were treated with some form of breast conserving therapy. Breast cancer (BC) was found in 56 of 68 patients (82%) with clinical PD, including 28 of 30 patients (93%) in group 1 and 28 of 38 patients (74%) in group 2. Breast cancer was centrally located (within 2 cm of the areolar margin) in 61% of patients, including 71% in group 1 and 50% in group 2. Of the 28 patients with an associated BC in group 1, 21 (75%) had invasive cancer, 6 (21%) had ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and 16 (57%) had pathologic axillary nodes. Of the 28 patients with an associated BC in group 2, 10 (36%) had invasive cancer, 18 (64%) had DCIS, and 6 (21%) had positive axillary nodes. The median survival was significantly shorter for group 1 (42 months) than for group 2 (126 months; p = 0.007).Conclusion: Most patients with PD have an associated BC (82%) that was centrally located (61%). In those patients without an associated mass, a significant number (26% in this series) may not have an underlying BC and may be overtreated with mastectomy. On the other hand, a significant number of patients with PD and no associated breast mass will be found to have a peripherally located tumor (29% in this series). These non-central BC masses could potentially be missed by a wide local excision that includes the areolar complex."

The composite anode was modeled as a mixture of ionic and electronic particles, randomly distributed at simple cubic lattice points. The dependence of the anodic polarization resistances on the volume fraction of the electronic phase, the thickness of the anode, and the insertion of various penetrating electrolyte structures were explored to obtain design criteria for best performing composite anodes. The network simulation showed that the penetrating electrolyte structures are advantageous over flat electrolytes by enabling more efficient use of electrochemical reaction sites, and thereby reducing the polarization resistances."

Oxalomalate reduces expression and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor in the retinal pigment epithelium and inhibits angiogenesis: Implications for age-related macular degeneration,"Sung Hwan Kim, Hyunjin Kim, Hyeong Jun Ku, Jung Hyun Park, Jeen-Woo Park, ","Redox Biology, Volume 10, December 2016, Pages 211-220, ","Clinical and experimental observations indicate a critical role for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), secreted by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), in pathological angiogenesis and the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). RPE-mediated VEGF expression, leading to angiogenesis, is a major signaling mechanism underlying ocular neovascular disease. Inhibiting this signaling pathway with a therapeutic molecule is a promising anti-angiogenic strategy to treat this disease with potentially fewer side effects. Oxalomalate (OMA) is a competitive inhibitor of NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), which plays an important role in cellular signaling pathways regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we have investigated the inhibitory effect of OMA on the expression of VEGF, and the associated underlying mechanism of action, using in vitro and in vivo RPE cell models of AMD. We found that OMA reduced the expression and secretion of VEGF in RPE cells, and consequently inhibited CNV formation. This function of OMA was linked to its capacity to activate the pVHL-mediated HIF-1汐 degradation in these cells, partly via a ROS-dependent ATM signaling axis, through inhibition of IDH enzymes. These findings reveal a novel role for OMA in inhibiting RPE-derived VEGF expression and angiogenesis, and suggest unique therapeutic strategies for treating pathological angiogenesis and AMD development.Download full-size image"

Standard statistical categories and player efficiency rating (PER), a measure that accounts for positive and negative playing statistics, were calculated to determine the impact of the injury on player performance relative to a matched comparison group. Over the study period, 31 NBA players had 32 ACL reconstructions. Two patients were excluded because of multiple ACL injuries, one was excluded because he never participated in league play, and another was the result of nonathletic activity.Of the 27 players in the study group, 6 (22%) did not return to NBA competition. Of the 21 players (78%) who did return to play, 4 (15%) had an increase in the preinjury PER, 5 (19%) remained within 1 point of the preinjury PER, and the PER decreased by more than 1 point after return to play in 12 (44%). Although decreases occurred in most of the statistical categories for players returning from ACL surgery, the number of games played, field goal percentage, and number of turnovers per game were the only categories with a statistically significant decrease. Players in the comparison group had a statistically significant increase in the PER over their careers, whereas the study group had a marked, though not statistically significant, increase in the PER in the season after reconstruction.After ACL reconstruction in 27 basketball players, 22% did not return to a sanctioned NBA game. For those returning to play, performance decreased by more than 1 PER point in 44% of the patients, although the changes were not statistically significant relative to the comparison group.Level IV, therapeutic case series."

As to whether personality affects emotion expression, a significant main effect for personality was not found and only a weak interaction between pitch and personality was reported. Thus contrary to the hypothesis that extroverts and introverts would convey emotions with different intensity and accuracy, there is no noticeable effect of personality on the emotion recognition system."

LMI based robust load frequency control for time delayed power system via delay margin estimation,"Linyun Xiong, Hao Li, Jie Wang, ","International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems, Volume 100, September 2018, Pages 91-103, ","The employment of communication channels inevitably result in the advent of time delays in load frequency control (LFC) schemes. The existence of such time delays exerts potential threats on the stability of power systems. This paper aims to study a three-area time delayed power system and propose a linear matrix inequality (LMI) based robust LFC scheme with delay margin estimation. Analytic form of the delay margin is subsequently provided. Following that, LMI based robust controller design procedure is proposed based on delay margin estimation, wherein the robust performance index (RPI) is introduced. The robust controller gains are ultimately obtained with the estimated delay margin and a binary search technique which aims to find the minimum value of RPI. Simulations are conducted to evaluate performance of the proposed scheme: the effectiveness of the DME process is verified under an ideal power system condition; a second simulation incorporating the effects on GRC and GDB is conducted to further validate the rightness of DMC; parameter perturbations are considered in the next simulation; a comparative study which compares the proposed approach with other three existing methods is initialized in the fourth simulation test; at last, the impact of a micro grid comprises wind and solar energy generation units is incorporated to test the performance of the novel method. The simulation results indicate that the delay margin estimation procedure is effective and the proposed control scheme is robust and has superior performance over conventional LMI based robust control schemes."
Aggressive angiomyxoma presenting with back and perineal bulge; a complex surgical approach: A case report,"Walid Faraj, Mohamad Houjeij, Ali Haydar, Hussein Nassar, Mohamad Khalife, ","International Journal of Surgery Case Reports, Volume 24, 2016, Pages 211-214, ","Aggressive angiomyxoma is a rare mesenchymal tumor occurring predominantly in the pelvi-perineal region. It is more common in females during their reproductive age. Our focus is on the surgical approach for a recurrent angiomyxoma.We present a case of a 36-year-old female patient with a recurrent lower back and perineal bulges. One year ago, she had the same presentation and underwent resection of that mass in a peripheral hospital without available information. Five months later, she started to have the same bulge. Computed tomography scan and true cut biopsy were suggestive of angiomyxoma with single lung metastasis. The decision was to proceed with resection through a transabdominal and perineal incision, even in the presence of metastasis since it＊s a very slow growing tumor with long life expectancy. The pathology was consistent with aggressive angiomyxoma.90% of patients with angiomyxoma are women. Although it is benign, the tumor is still aggressive because of the high rate of local recurrence after resection. Angiomyxoma is a mesenchymal tumor, composed of fibroblasts within a myxoid background. Treatment is usually through wide local excision to achieve an R0 resection. Our approach was through a transabdominal and perineal incision, which allowed full control and mobilization of the tumor without disrupting the capsule. This surgical approach was not described previously in the literature.The principle to achieve cure in aggressive angiomyxoma is by optimizing exposure through two different incisions, wide excision while keeping the capsule intact and removing enbloc any invaded organ."
Constrained location of competitive facilities in the plane,"Ronald G. McGarvey, Tom M. Cavalier, ","Computers & Operations Research, Volume 32, Issue 2, February 2005, Pages 359-378, ","This paper examines a competitive facility location problem occurring in the plane. A new gravity-based utility model is developed, in which the capacity of a facility serves as its measure of attractiveness. A new problem formulation is given, having elastic gravity-based demand, along with capacity, forbidden region, and budget constraints. Two solution algorithms are presented, one based on the big square small square method, and the second based on a penalty function formulation using fixed-point iteration. Computational testing is presented, comparing these two algorithms along with a general-purpose nonlinear solver.In a competitive business environment where products are not distinguishable, facility location plays an important role in an organization's success. This paper examines a firm's problem of selecting the locations in the plane for a set of new facilities such that market capture is maximized across all of the firm's facilities (both new and pre-existing). Customers are assumed to divide their demand among all competing facilities according to a utility function that considers facility attractiveness (measured by facility capacity for satisfying demand) and customer-facility distance. The level of customer demand is assumed to be a function of the facility configuration. Three types of constraints are introduced, involving facility capacity, forbidden regions for new facility location, and a budget function. Two solution algorithms are devised, one based on branch-and-bound methods and the other based on penalty functions. Computational testing is presented, comparing these two algorithms along with a general-purpose nonlinear solver."

A Bayesian approach to demand forecasting for new equipment programs,"Jennifer J. Bergman, James S. Noble, Ronald G. McGarvey, Randolph L. Bradley, ","Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, Volume 47, October 2017, Pages 17-21, ","Demand forecasting is a fundamental component in a range of industrial problems (e.g., inventory management, equipment maintenance). Forecasts are crucial to accurately estimating spare or replacement part demand to determine inventory stock levels. Estimating demand becomes challenging when parts experience intermittent demand/failures versus demand at more regular intervals or high quantities. In this paper, we develop a demand forecasting approach that utilizes Bayes＊ rule to improve the forecast accuracy of parts from new equipment programs where established demand patterns have not had sufficient time to develop. In these instances, the best information available tends to be ※engineering estimates§ based on like /similar parts or engineering projections. A case study is performed to validate the forecasting methodology. The validation compared the performance of the proposed Bayesian method and traditional forecasting methods for both forecast accuracy and overall inventory fill rate performance. The analysis showed that for specific situations the Bayesian-based forecasting approach more accurately predicts part demand, impacting part availability (fill rate) and inventory cost. This improved forecasting ability will enable managers to make better inventory investment decisions for new equipment programs."

Strong evidence indicates that reducing the plasma cholesterol level results in a decrease in the expected incidence of CHD. The decline in the death rate from CHD in the U.S. population over the past 2 decades has occurred simultaneously with a reduction in the consumption of cholesterol and saturated fat and a dramatic increase in the use of unsaturated vegetable oils. Over the same period, the mean cholesterol level has decreased at least 5 %. This finding explains up to one-third of the decline in CHD mortality observed since 1968."

Manufacturing productivity in China and India: The role of institutional changes,"Manish Pandey, Xiao-yuan Dong, ","China Economic Review, Volume 20, Issue 4, December 2009, Pages 754-766, ","In this paper we undertake a comparative study of productivity in the manufacturing sector for China and India using data from survey of manufacturing industries for the two countries. We find that productivity of manufacturing industries in China relative to that in India improved substantially over the 1998每2003 period. Specifically, the average total factor productivity (TFP) growth for the manufacturing sector over this period was about 11% higher in China than in India. We document two substantial changes in government policies in China that were not witnessed in India. First, the late 1990s saw an enormous wave of ownership restructuring due to the formal endorsement of private property rights by the Chinese central government. Second, in 1997 a large scale labour retrenchment program was launched to address the long standing problem of labour redundancy in the public sector. Using data from the Chinese survey of manufacturing industries, we quantify the impact of these large scale institutional changes on TFP of Chinese manufacturing industries. We find that these policy changes can explain about 30% of the growth in TFP of manufacturing industries. Hence we conclude that these institutional changes in China can account for a significant part of the gains in productivity of manufacturing industries in China relative to that in India over the 1998每2003 period."

The current study evaluated 843 RCC from the three major histologic subtypes, including 488 clear cell RCC, 274 papillary RCC, and 81 chromophobe RCC. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic analysis of the RCC subtypes reveals distinctive features of each subtype that provide the foundation for the development of subtype-specific therapeutic and management strategies for patients affected with these cancers. Somatic alteration of BAP1, PBRM1, and PTEN and altered metabolic pathways correlated with subtype-specific decreased survival, while CDKN2A alteration, increased DNA hypermethylation, and increases in the immune-related Th2 gene expression signature correlated with decreased survival within all major histologic subtypes. CIMP-RCC demonstrated an increased immune signature, and a uniform and distinct metabolic expression pattern identified a subset of metabolically divergent (MD) ChRCC that associated with extremely poor survival.Download high-res image (397KB)Download full-size image"

"Testing biological control of colonization by vestimentiferan tubeworms at deep-sea hydrothermal vents (East Pacific Rise, 9∼50∩N)","Heather L. Hunt, Anna Metaxas, Robert M. Jennings, Kenneth M. Halanych, Lauren S. Mullineaux, ","Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers, Volume 51, Issue 2, February 2004, Pages 225-234, ","Three species of vestimentiferans are found at hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise (EPR). Tevnia jerichonana is an early colonist and Riftia pachyptila has the greatest biomass in established vent assemblages, but the role of Oasisia alvinae, a small species that occurs sporadically, is unknown. Anecdotal evidence suggests that O. alvinae may be abundant in the microhabitat underneath mussels. Previous studies have suggested that early T. jerichonana colonists may facilitate settlement of the late colonist R. pachyptila. To address potential mechanisms for the successional sequence and to explore the role of O. alvinae, we examined the effects of the presence of vestimentiferan (R. pachyptila and T. jerichonana) tubes and mussel (Bathymodiolus thermophilis) shell cover on recruitment of vestimentiferans on basalt blocks deployed at 9∼50∩N, 104∼17∩W on the EPR. A molecular assay was used to identify individuals to species since they were too small to be identified morphologically. Although colonists in both experiments belonged to all three species of vestimentiferans, only a few were T. jerichonana. Colonization of vestimentiferans did not increase in the presence of vestimentiferan tubes. The presence of mussel shell cover did not influence the proportions of R. pachyptila and O. alvinae, or the total number of colonists. Because the experimental blocks in this study were placed within dense clumps of R. pachyptila, we suggest that, while T. jerichonana may be an important cue for vestimentiferans settling at new vents, adult R. pachyptila also can act as a settlement cue for larvae. O. alvinae colonists were abundant in all of the treatments in our experiments, indicating that, although adults of this species are apparently rare at these sites, O. alvinae can settle in abundance if a suitable micro-environment is available."

The degree to which the actual given value A of a variable X agrees with the antecedent value B in a production ※If X is B then Y is C§ is represented as a fuzzy subset of a truth space. We introduce a new form of implication based on the exponential operation. A new compatibility relation based on the input value A and the antecedent value B is defined. A fuzzy truth value true derived from the antecedent value B is also defined. It is shown that by mapping this compatibility relation into the truth space, a fuzzy truth value is generated which produces an exponential family of the fuzzy truth value true. We show that the inferred consequent can be generated from this truth value. Theoretical results showing the validity of this method to (1) chain rules consisting of several single fuzzy conditional propositions, and (2) conjunctive fuzzy conditional propositions, are also presented. Theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that our method is superior to the existing methods when intuitively correct responses are required."

"Association between sleep duration, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of depressive symptoms","Lan Guo, Yan Xu, Jianxiong Deng, Jinghui Huang, Ciyong Lu, ","Journal of Affective Disorders, Volume 208, 15 January 2017, Pages 355-362, ","Suicidal ideation and attempts are still currently serious problems among adolescents worldwide, and there is evidence that sleep problem may be associated with increased rates of mental disorder. This study aimed to examine the associations between sleep duration and suicidal ideation and attempts among adolescents and to test whether depressive symptoms have moderating effects on the associations.A 3-stage, stratified cluster, random sampling method was used to collect data from 20,130 high school students in southeast China.The weighted prevalence of short sleep among Chinese adolescents was 5.6% (95% CI, 5.3每6.0%), and the weighted prevalence of long sleep was 2.7% (95% CI, 2.5每3.0%). The final results demonstrated that short sleep was positively associated with suicidal ideation (AOR=2.28, 95% CI=1.96每2.66) and suicidal attempts (AOR=3.20, 95% CI=2.46每4.16), and long sleep was only significantly associated with suicidal attempts (AOR=2.47, 95% CI=1.70每3.58). Stratification analyses conducted separately for students with and without depressive symptoms demonstrated that depressive symptoms may have moderating effects on the associations between sleep duration and suicidality.Our study sample only included school students, and causal inference could not be examined due to the cross-sectional design.Sleep duration was associated with suicidal ideation and attempts, and the association between sleep duration and suicidal attempts was U-shaped. These findings support that proper treatments services with the potential to restore adolescent normal sleep would be helpful in preventing suicidality among adolescents."

Of these, 151 patients underwent mastectomy after NAC. The effect of PMRT on disease-free survival (DFS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS), and overall survival (OS) was evaluated by multivariate analysis including known prognostic factors using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log每rank test and Cox proportional regression analysis.Of the 151 patients who underwent mastectomy, 105 (69.5%) received PMRT and 46 patients (30.5%) did not. At a median follow-up of 59 months, 5 patients (3.3%) developed LRR (8 sites of recurrence) and 14 patients (9.3%) developed distant metastasis. The 5-year DFS, LRRFS, and OS rates were 91.2, 98.1, and 93.3% with PMRT and 83.0%, 92.3%, and 89.9% without PMRT, respectively (all P values not significant). By univariate analysis, only age (≒40 vs >40 years) was significantly associated with decreased DFS (P=.027). By multivariate analysis, age (≒40 vs >40 years) and pathologic T stage (0-is vs 1 vs 2-4) were significant prognostic factors affecting DFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.353, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.135-0.928, P=.035; HR 2.223, 95% CI 1.074-4.604, P=.031, respectively). PMRT showed no correlation with a difference in DFS, LRRFS, or OS by multivariate analysis.PMRT might not be necessary for pN0 patients after NAC, regardless of clinical stage. Prospective randomized clinical trial data are needed to assess whether PMRT can be safely omitted in pN0 patients after NAC and mastectomy for clinical stage II-III breast cancer."

The system of number balances were generated using section shapes that were decaying exponentials with modified residence times and growth rates consistent with fluxes due to particle deposition, and solved with a modified Newton's method. The solutions obtained satisfied the number, volume, and sixth moment balances, and had minimal discontinuities at the section boundaries for five forms of the aggregation kernel (size-independent, linear, quadratic, cubic in size, and Brownian), with growth parameters that are easily derived with a high level of confidence. Each kernel had unique characteristics, and showed different kinds of size-dependent growth. Simulations were compared with a distribution obtained for the continuous crystallization of an alum salt, and showed that the linear kernel compared well.

Mitomycin 8 is a dimer connected by a 1,2-dithiolane (a five-membered cyclic disulfide) linker, and was specifically designed to undergo nucleophilic activation and double DNA alkylations leading to efficient production of DNA interstrand cross-link (DNA ISC) adducts. Disulfide cleavage in 8 would generate two thiol groups that could serve as probes to activate two mitomycin rings. At first, the target mitomycin 8 was synthesized using mitomycin A (1) and the key intermediate, cyclic disulfide (10), which was prepared through a seven-step synthetic sequence. Diol mitomycin 9 was also synthesized from 1 and diamine salt 13. Next, kinetic studies using solvolysis reaction revealed that the activation rates of 8 were much higher than those of 9 and mitomycin C (2) under nucleophilic conditions provided by Et3P presumably due to the presence of a cyclic disulfide unit in 8. These findings led us to propose a nucleophilic activation pathway for 8. Then, DNA ISC experiments further revealed that the levels of DNA ISC caused by 8 in the presence of Et3P were much higher (97%) than those by 9 (5%) and 2 (4%). More importantly, mitomycin 8 underwent much faster activation and produced slightly higher levels of DNA ISC than the previously reported mitomycins 5每7. Overall, we concluded that 8 was highly efficient for both nucleophilic activation and corresponding DNA ISC formation, and that this differentiation came from the crucial function of the cyclic disulfide unit in 8.A mitomycin dimer connected by a 1,2-dithiolane (a five-membered cyclic disulfide) linker was highly efficient for nucleophilic activation and corresponding production of DNA interstrand cross-link (DNA ISC) adducts."

This model takes into account the effects of surface diffusion and the influence of metal-adsorbate (M-A) and adsorbate-adsorbate (A-A) interactions on the coverage dependence of the activation energy for desorption. The inclusion of M-A and A-A interactions has a pronounced effect on the shape of the predicted TPD spectrum. Where only a single peak is observed in the absence of M-A and A-A interactions, multiple peaks are found when these interactions are included. The inclusion of M-A and A-A interactions is also shown to produce a nonlinear decline in the activation energy for desorption as a function of increasing adsorbate coverage. Simulated TPD spectra for CO desorption from a Pd(100) surface and for H2 desorption from Mo(100) and Ni(111) surfaces, obtained using the Monte Carlo model, are in satisfactory agreement with those observed experimentally. An important feature of the model is that it describes correctly the observed dependence of the activation energy on adsorbate coverage."

Geometrically nonlinear beam analysis of composite wind turbine blades based on quadrature element method,"Xiandong Zhou, Kefu Huang, Zheng Li, ","International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics, Volume 104, September 2018, Pages 87-99, ","A new nonlinear beam theory is proposed for the analysis of composite wind turbine blades. The beam theory is developed by extending classical Euler每Bernoulli beam theory to a generalized Timoshenko beam. Mechanics-based variables are used to describe finite rotation such that the problems of the sequence dependence or spatially discontinuity of rotational variables can be avoided. Furthermore, nonlinear beam theory is implemented using the weak-form quadrature element method. Numerical examples of both non-rotating and rotating beams are given and the comparison with analytical and finite element results shows high computational accuracy and efficiency of the proposed nonlinear quadrature element. A simple parametric study of a virtual 5-MW wind turbine blade shows that bend-twist coupling due to both material anisotropy and geometrical nonlinearity affects the dynamic performance of the blade significantly."
Do managers act opportunistically towards the end of their career?,"Rezaul Kabir, Hao Li, Yulia Veld-Merkoulova, ","Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, Volume 56, September 2018, Pages 218-232, ","As managers approach retirement, their career horizons become shorter and they might start to behave opportunistically by taking a more risk-averse and short-term orientation. Long-term risky investments, such as research and development, can suffer the most from this problem as their payoff comes long after CEOs retire. To mitigate such behavior, most executive compensation contracts include long-term performance incentives. In this study, we hypothesize that long-term debt-like compensation in the form of defined benefit pension can make the career horizon problem more severe. We empirically examine the impact of managerial opportunism, influenced by pension compensation, on the research and development investments. We find that on average UK CEOs do not curtail research and development as their career horizons become shorter. But, the defined-benefit pension component of executive compensation leads CEOs, who are closer to retirement, to decrease R&D investments. Our results imply that executive compensation contracts need to be appropriately adjusted when managers approach retirement."
Repressed Ca2+ clearance in parthenolide-treated murine brain bEND.3 endothelial cells,"Tien-Yao Tsai, Shyh-Liang Lou, Ka-Shun Cheng, Kar-Lok Wong, Yuk-Man Leung, ","European Journal of Pharmacology, Volume 769, 15 December 2015, Pages 280-286, ","Parthenolide is a sesquiterpene lactone compound isolated from the leaves and flowerheads of the plant feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium). The anticancer effects of parthenolide have been well studied and this lactone compound is currently under clinical trials. Parthenolide is also a protective agent in cardiac reperfusion injury via its inhibition of nuclear factor-百B (NF-百B). Not much is known if this compound affects signal transduction in non-tumor cells. We investigated whether parthenolide affected Ca2+ signaling in endothelial cells, key components in regulating the vascular tone. In this work using mouse cortical microvascular bEND.3 endothelial cells, we found that a 15-h treatment with parthenolide resulted in amplified ATP-triggered Ca2+ signal; the latter had a very slow decay rate suggesting suppression of Ca2+ clearance. Evidence suggests parthenolide suppressed Ca2+ clearance by inhibiting the plasmalemmal Ca2+ pump; such suppression did not result from decreased expression of the plasmalemmal Ca2+ pump protein. Rather, such suppression was possibly a consequence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, since salubrinal (an ER stress protector) was able to alleviate parthenolide-induced Ca2+ clearance suppression. Given the current deployment of parthenolide as an anti-cancer drug in clinical trials and the potential usage of this lactone as a cardioprotectant, it is important to examine in details the perturbing effects of parthenolide on Ca2+ homeostasis in endothelial cells and neighboring vascular smooth muscle cells, activities of which exert profound effects on hemodynamics."
A survey of NO2:SO2 emission ratios measured in marine vessel plumes in the Strait of Georgia,"Robert McLaren, Patryk Wojtal, Jamie D. Halla, Cris Mihele, Jeffrey R. Brook, ","Atmospheric Environment, Volume 46, January 2012, Pages 655-658, ","We report nocturnal measurements of NO2 and SO2 by DOAS within marine vessel plumes that impact an island site close to Vancouver during the summer of 2005. The median NO2/SO2 molar ratio from 17 ship plumes (2.86) is marginally higher than the molar NOx/SOx emissions ratio for both: marine vessel emissions (2.39每2.66) in a 2005 inventory for the region and, ※underway§ emissions of major ocean going vessels (2.04每2.12) in a related marine inventory. Due to the limited nature of our survey, we conclude that the difference between observations and inventories is not unreasonable. The generally low NO2/SO2 ratios we observe are a direct result of the high sulfur content of marine fuels. Measurement of NO2/SO2 ratios is one way to monitor future changes that will occur when new regulations come into force in the Emissions Control Area (ECA) for North American waters, with restrictions on the sulfur content of marine fuel by 2012."
Spatial dependence of predictions from image segmentation: A variogram-based method to determine appropriate scales for producing land-management information,"Jason W. Karl, Brian A. Maurer, ","Ecological Informatics, Volume 5, Issue 3, May 2010, Pages 194-202, ","A significant challenge in ecological studies has been defining scales of observation that correspond to the relevant ecological scales for organisms or processes of interest. Remote sensing has become commonplace in ecological studies and management, but the default resolution of imagery often used in studies is an arbitrary scale of observation. Segmentation of images into objects has been proposed as an alternative method for scaling remotely-sensed data into units having ecological meaning. However, to date, the selection of image object sets to represent landscape patterns has been largely subjective. Changes in observation scale affect the variance and spatial dependence of measured variables, and may be useful in determining which levels of image segmentation are most appropriate for a given purpose. We used observations of percent bare-ground cover from 346 field sites in a semi-arid shrub-steppe ecosystem of southern Idaho to look at the changes in spatial dependence of regression predictions and residuals for 10 different levels of image segmentation. We found that the segmentation level whose regression predictions had spatial dependence that most closely matched the spatial dependence of the field samples also had the strongest predicted-to-observed correlations. This suggested that for percent bare-ground cover in our study area an appropriate scale could be defined. With the incorporation of a geostatistical interpolator to predict the value of regression residuals at unsampled locations, however, we achieved consistently strong correlations across many segmentation levels. This suggests that if spatial dependence in percent bare ground is accounted for, a range of appropriate scales could be defined. Because the best analysis scale may vary for different ecosystem attributes and many inquiries consider more than one attribute, methods that can perform well across a range of scales and perhaps not at a single, ideal scale are important. More work is needed to develop methods that consider a wider range of ways to segment images into different scales and select sets of scales that perform best for answering specific management questions. The robustness of ecological landscape analyses will increase as methods are devised that remove the subjectivity with which observational scales are defined and selected."

Brown, Francois-Xavier Briand, Olivier Guionie, Evelyne Lemaitre, Nicolas Eterradossi, ","Journal of Virological Methods, Volume 193, Issue 1, October 2013, Pages 121-127, ","Determining the sequence of non-segmented, negative sense RNA viral genomes is far from routine and often requires the application of several techniques. In this study, an existing method used currently just for determination of the genomic 3∩ extremity was used to determine both the 3∩ and 5∩ sequence extremities of a Newcastle disease virus and an avian metapneumovirus. This was achieved with a single 3∩ nucleotide tailing reaction of both the genomic RNA and the full length, positive sense, antigenomic RNA, followed by a single reverse transcription reaction targeted to the common polynucleotide tails, and then individual PCRs specific for each extremity using PCR primers derived from the sequence of the RT primer or from neighbouring virus sequences known previously. For each virus the method was employed separately. Sequences from both viruses were in agreement with those reported previously for other paramyxoviruses, yet one extra base at the 3∩ and one extra base at the 5∩ were identified for the avian metapneumovirus. In this study, importantly, the newly determined extremities maintained the complementarity known to exist between the extremities of these viruses. The method was equally successful with both viruses and can be tailored easily to function with other non-segmented, negative sense viruses through minor modification of only the primer sequences."

There are several alternative splice isoforms of this gene, the longest of which, TRIOBP-6, comprises 23 exons. The linkage interval for the deafness segregating in these families includes DFNB28.

Highly efficient randomized authentication in VANETs,"Jian Kang, Dan Lin, Wei Jiang, Elisa Bertino, ","Pervasive and Mobile Computing, Volume 44, February 2018, Pages 31-44, ","Considering the huge number of vehicles on the roads, Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are envisioned to foster a variety of new applications ranging from road safety enhancement to mobile entertainment. These new VANET applications all face a critical challenge which is to ensure the identity and location privacy of vehicles＊ owners who participate in such ad-hoc network. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient randomized authentication protocol that leverages homomorphic encryption to allow each individual vehicle to self-generate any number of authenticated identities to achieve full anonymity in VANETs. The proposed protocol prevents vehicles from being tracked by any single party including peer vehicles, service providers, authentication servers, and other infrastructure. Meanwhile, our protocol also provides traceability in case of any dispute. We have conducted both security analysis and experimental study which demonstrates the superiority of our protocol compared to other existing works."
Identifying Optimal Multi-state collaborations for reducing CO2 emissions by co-firing biomass in coal-burning power plants,"Bayram Dundar, Ronald G. McGarvey, Francisco X. Aguilar, ","Computers & Industrial Engineering, Volume 101, November 2016, Pages 403-415, ","The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently proposed a rule that aims to reduce carbon emissions from US coal-fired power plants. The proposed ※Clean Power Plan§ specifies state-specific rate-based goals to achieve a total US carbon emission reduction of 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. An increase in the co-firing of woody biomass with coal to generate biopower is one of the potential approaches that electricity providers could take to comply with EPA＊s proposed rules. We develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to identify minimum-cost approaches for reducing CO2 emissions via co-firing biomass subject to spatially-explicit biomass availability constraints. An important feature of the EPA recommendations is an allowance for states to participate in multi-state compliance strategies. We extend the MILP model to optimize within a larger geographical framework that allows states to identify minimum-cost partnerships that meet aggregated emission reduction goals. We apply the MILP model to data for five Midwestern US states to determine the role that co-firing biomass could play in achieving their EPA-proposed emission reduction targets, and find that some states can meet their renewable energy generation targets through co-firing, although co-firing alone is not sufficient to achieve any state＊s emission reduction targets."
Inferring shortfall costs and integrating environmental costs into optimal production levels for an all-you-care-to-eat food service operation,"Esma Birisci, Ronald G. McGarvey, ","International Journal of Production Economics, Volume 182, December 2016, Pages 157-164, ","This study examines how optimal food production policies at an all-you-care-to-eat (AYCTE) facility would change were life cycle cost estimates of embodied CO2 included in the disposal costs associated with overproduction, in an aim to study production planning possibilities in a situation that places increased emphasis on the environmental impacts of overproduction. AYCTE operations exhibit a lack of revenue associated with each item served, since there is no per-item lost sales value incurred when demand exceeds supply; accordingly, the second objective of this research is to present a novel method for estimating shortfall costs in a setting with no marginal revenue per satisfied unit of demand. We examine empirical data from AYCTE operations at the University of Missouri's Campus Dining Services (CDS) to infer the per-item shortfall costs that are implied by CDS management's historical production decisions. Consistent with CDS management's stated aversion to shortfalls, we estimate shortfall values which are between 1.6 and 2.7 times larger than the procurement cost and between 30 and over 100 times larger than the disposal cost. Utilizing published estimates of life cycle CO2 and the social cost of carbon, we identify a per-portion environmental cost. We incorporate the environmental costs associated with wasted overproduction and the inferred shortfall cost estimates into a newsvendor model formulation, to identify new optimal production levels, illustrating this approach with application to a set of food items served by CDS. We find that optimal production levels are decreased significantly (18每25%) for food items with high environmental impacts (such as beef), and reduced less for foods with less embodied CO2."
Optimal production planning utilizing leftovers for an all-you-care-to-eat food service operation,"Esma Birisci, Ronald G. McGarvey, ","Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 171, 10 January 2018, Pages 984-994, ","Food service operations in an all-you-care-to-eat environment need to consider two conflicting objectives: a desire to reduce overproduction food waste (and its corresponding environmental impacts), and an aversion to shortfalls (in which some customer demands go unsatisfied). A particular challenge in such buffet-style operations is the absence of any lost marginal revenue associated with lost sales that can be used to measure the shortfall cost, complicating any attempt to determine a minimum-cost solution. This research presents a multi-criteria optimization approach to identify the efficient frontier of points lying between the minimum-waste and minimum-shortfall solutions. In particular, we identify optimal production adjustments relative to demand forecasts, demand thresholds for utilization of leftovers, and percentages of demand to be satisfied by leftovers, considering two alternative metrics for overproduction waste: mass; and greenhouse gas emissions (to account for the embodied chemical usage during farming, transportation, and landfill decomposing of overproduced food waste). A statistical analysis of the changes in decision variable values across each of the efficient frontiers can then be performed to identify the key variables that could be modified to reduce the amount of wasted food at minimal increase in shortfalls (or, alternatively, to reduce the amount of shortfalls at minimal increase in waste). We illustrate our approach with an application to empirical data from Campus Dining Services operations at the University of Missouri. Our analysis suggests that targeted production level modifications, rather than blanket increases or decreases, can allow food service providers to reduce overproduction food waste without significant increases in demand shortfalls."
Distinct current modules shape cellular dynamics in model neurons,"Adel Alturki, Feng Feng, Ajay Nair, Vinay Guntu, Satish S. Nair, ","Neuroscience, Volume 334, 15 October 2016, Pages 309-331, ","Numerous intrinsic currents are known to collectively shape neuronal membrane potential dynamics, or neuronal signatures. Although how sets of currents shape specific signatures such as spiking characteristics or oscillations has been studied individually, it is less clear how a neuron＊s suite of currents jointly shape its entire set of signatures. Biophysical conductance-based models of neurons represent a viable tool to address this important question. We hypothesized that currents are grouped into distinct modules that shape specific neuronal characteristics or signatures, such as resting potential, sub-threshold oscillations, and spiking waveforms, for several classes of neurons. For such a grouping to occur, the currents within one module should have minimal functional interference with currents belonging to other modules. This condition is satisfied if the gating functions of currents in the same module are grouped together on the voltage axis; in contrast, such functions are segregated along the voltage axis for currents belonging to different modules. We tested this hypothesis using four published example case models and found it to be valid for these classes of neurons. This insight into the neurobiological organization of currents also suggests an intuitive, systematic, and robust methodology to develop biophysical single-cell models with multiple biological characteristics applicable for both hand- and automated-tuning approaches. We illustrate the methodology using two example case rodent pyramidal neurons, from the lateral amygdala and the hippocampus. The methodology also helped reveal that a single-core compartment model could capture multiple neuronal properties. Such biophysical single-compartment models have potential to improve the fidelity of large network models."

Melt flow and heat transfer in laser drilling,"Youqing Yang, Zhen Chen, Yuwen Zhang, ","International Journal of Thermal Sciences, Volume 107, September 2016, Pages 141-152, ","During the laser drilling process the recoil pressure drives melt flow and affects the heat transfer and material removal rate. To get a more realistic picture of the melt flow, a series of differential equations are formulated here that govern the process from pre-heating to melting and evaporation. In particular, the Navier每Stokes equation governing the melt flow is solved with the use of the boundary layer theory and integral methods. Heat conduction in solid is investigated by using the classical method with the corrections that reflect the change in boundary condition from the constant heat flux to Stefan condition. The dependence of saturation temperature on the vapor pressure is taken into account by using the Clausius每Clapeyron equation. Both constantly rising radial velocity profiles and rising-fall velocity profiles are considered. The proposed approach is compared with existing ones. In spite of the assumed varying velocity profiles, the proposed model predicts that the drilling hole profiles are very close to each other in a specific super alloy for given laser beam intensity and pulse duration. The numerical results show that the effect of melt flow on material removal can be ignored in some cases. The findings obtained from the current work provide a better understanding of the effects of melt flow and vaporization on the laser drilling profile evolution, and could improve the solid material removal efficiency."

First, we reviewed the motivations for coupling prediction models for building energy and indoor environment. This review classified various exchanged data in different applications as interface data and state data, and found that choosing different data sets may lead to varying performance of stability, convergence, and speed for the co-simulation. Second, our review shows that an external coupling scheme is substantially more popular in implementations of co-simulation than an internal coupling scheme. The external coupling is shown to be generally faster in computational speed, as well as easier to implement, maintain and expand than the internal coupling. Third, the external coupling can be carried out in different data synchronization schemes, including static coupling and dynamic coupling. In comparison, the static coupling that performs data exchange only once is computationally faster and more stable than the dynamic coupling. However, concerning accuracy, the dynamic coupling that requires multiple times of data exchange is more accurate than the static coupling. Furthermore, the review identified that the implementation of the external coupling can be achieved through customized interfaces, middleware, and standard interfaces. The customized interface is straightforward but may be limited to a specific coupling application. The middleware is versatile and user-friendly but usually limited in data synchronization schemes. The standard interface is versatile and promising, but may be difficult to implement. Current applications of the co-simulation are mainly energy performance evaluation and control studies. Finally, we discussed the limitations of the current research and provided an overview for future research."
Supplementation of Influenza Split Vaccines with Conserved M2 Ectodomains Overcomes Strain Specificity and Provides Long-term Cross Protection,"Min-Chul Kim, Yu-Na Lee, Eun-Ju Ko, Jong Seok Lee, Sang-Moo Kang, ","Molecular Therapy, Volume 22, Issue 7, July 2014, Pages 1364-1374, ","Current influenza vaccines do not provide good protection against antigenically different influenza A viruses. As an approach to overcome strain specificity of protection, this study demonstrates significantly improved long-term cross protection by supplementing split vaccines with a conserved molecular target, a repeat of the influenza M2 ectodomain (M2e) expressed on virus-like particles (M2e5x VLPs) in a membrane-anchored form. Intramuscular immunization with H1N1 split vaccine (A/California/07/2009) supplemented with M2e5x VLPs induced M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, and shaped the host responses to the vaccine in the direction of T-helper type 1 responses inducing dominant IgG2a isotype antibodies as well as interferon-污 (IFN-污) producing cells in systemic and mucosal sites. Upon lethal challenge, M2e5x VLP-supplemented vaccination lowered lung viral loads and induced long-term cross protection against H3N2 or H5N1 subtype influenza viruses over 12 months. M2e antibodies, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells were found to contribute to improving heterosubtypic cross protection. In addition, improved cross protection by supplemented vaccination with M2e5x VLPs was mediated via Fc receptors. The results support evidence that supplementation with M2e5x VLPs is a promising approach for overcoming the limitation of strain-specific protection by current influenza vaccination."
Idh2 deficiency accelerates renal dysfunction in aged mice,"Su Jeong Lee, Hanvit Cha, Seoyoon Lee, Hyunjin Kim, Jeen-Woo Park, ","Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Volume 493, Issue 1, 4 November 2017, Pages 34-39, ","The free radical or oxidative stress theory of aging postulates that senescence is due to an accumulation of cellular oxidative damage, caused largely by reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are produced as by-products of normal metabolic processes in mitochondria. The oxidative stress may arise as a result of either increased ROS production or decreased ability to detoxify ROS. The availability of the mitochondrial NADPH pool is critical for the maintenance of the mitochondrial antioxidant system. The major enzyme responsible for generating mitochondrial NADPH is mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2). Depletion of IDH2 in mice (idh2-/-) shortens life span and accelerates the degeneration of multiple age-sensitive traits, such as hair grayness, skin pathology, and eye pathology. Among the various internal organs tested in this study, IDH2 depletion-induced acceleration of senescence was uniquely observed in the kidney. Renal function and structure were greatly deteriorated in 24-month-old idh2-/- mice compared with wild-type. In addition, disruption of redox status, which promotes oxidative damage and apoptosis, was more pronounced in idh2-/- mice. These data support a significant role for increased oxidative stress as a result of compromised mitochondrial antioxidant defenses in modulating life span in mice, and thus support the oxidative stress theory of aging."

Parameters were also calculated for crown-to-rump and crown-to-heels for fetal lengths that occur during pregnancy."
DNA computation based on self-assembled nanoparticle probes for 0每1 integer programming problem,"Fei Li, Jingming Liu, Zheng Li, ","Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, Volume 151, September 2018, Pages 140-146, ","0每1 integer programming problem is very important in opsearch with widespread application. In this paper, a new DNA computing model based on self-assembled nanoparticle probes is presented to solve it, in which the nanoparticle and oligonucleotides are integrated for the first time. Its essence is that all possible combinations of variable 0 or 1 for given problem are encoded in the recognition zone of self-assembled nanoparticle probes, and feasible solutions are judged through their hybridization of target sequences. Major benefits of this method include vast parallelism, extraordinary information density and easy controllable operation. The result reveals the potential of DNA computation based on nano technology in solving complex integer programming problem."

Monte carlo simulation of temperature-programmed desorption of coadsorbed species,"Stephen J. Lombardo, Alexis T. Bell, ","Surface Science, Volume 224, Issues 1每3, 3 December 1989, Pages 451-475, ","A Monte Carlo model is presented for describing the temperature-programmed desorption of coadsorbed species from single-crystal surfaces. Interactions between the adsorbates and the metal surface as well as interactions between the adsorbates are taken into account using the bondorder -conservation-Morse-potential (BOC-MP) approach. The number, shape, and location of the peaks is shown to be sensitive to the binding energy, coverage, and coordination of each coadsorbed species. The presence of a strongly bound coadsorbate on a bcc (100) surface is shown to shift the desorption spectrum for associative desorption of adsorbed atoms to lower temperatures. TPD spectra for the concurrent associative desorption of A atoms and the desorption of B molecules from an fcc (100) surface are of two types: in one case, both species exhibit new low-temperature features far removed from their pure component spectra; in the second case, only the species undergoing associative desorption displays new spectral features. The simulated TPD spectra are in qualitative agreement with experimental results for H2 coadsorbed with strongly bound atomic species on Mo(100) and Fe(100) surfaces as well as for CO and H2 coadsorbed on Ni(100) and Rh(100) surfaces."

Positive PCR amplicons were subjected to sequencing confirmation and BLAST analysis.Initial PCR screening for CyCV-VS5700009 identified one sample, showing a PCR band of expected size (380 bp). Sequencing and BLAST analysis, however, indicated that the band was 364 bp in length and showed >99% nucleotide homology to a human gene known as nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (NCOA6). Pairwise sequence alignment confirmed that both the forward and reverse PCR primers used had significant homology (>70%) to NCOA6. None of the CSF samples tested were positive for CyCV-VS5700009.The original PCR assay for CyCV-VS5700009 detection may have potential cross-reactivity with contaminating human genomic DNA.

"Pathways to arithmetic: The role of visual-spatial and language skills in written arithmetic, arithmetic word problems, and nonsymbolic arithmetic","Xiao Zhang, Dan Lin, ","Contemporary Educational Psychology, Volume 41, April 2015, Pages 188-197, ","This study set out to develop and test a pathway model of the relations between general cognitive skills, specifically visual-spatial and spoken and written language skills, and competence in three forms of arithmetic that vary in modes of number representation. A total of 88 Chinese 4-year-olds participated and were tested first in kindergarten second grade (K2) and then in kindergarten third grade (K3). Language skills, including phonological, morphological, and visual-orthographic skills, and visual-spatial skills were measured at K2, and arithmetic outcomes, including written arithmetic, word problems, and nonsymbolic arithmetic, at K3. The results generally supported our model. Specifically, visual-spatial skills contributed to the prediction of all three types of arithmetic outcomes. Morphological skills predicted word problems, whereas phonological skills predicted written arithmetic. Finally, visual-orthographic skills contributed to both written and nonsymbolic arithmetic. These findings underscore the importance of delineating the specificity of cognitive processes in learning diverse forms of arithmetic."
Statistical mechanics of complex ecological aggregates,"Brian A. Maurer, ","Ecological Complexity, Volume 2, Issue 1, March 2005, Pages 71-85, ","A fundamental limitation of classical science was its inability to explain how order could emerge out of uncertainty and indeterminism. The approach to solving this dilemma has been to develop theories of how properties of aggregated systems arise from the properties and interactions of their parts. The basic assumption of such ideas is that there is a tension between the tendency of an aggregated system to change and the constraints that are imposed upon that system by virtue of the behavior of and interactions among the parts. The balance between constraint and change gives rise to a hierarchy of aggregated structures that exhibit regular, repeatable attributes to the degree that constraints are able to maintain change across time within boundaries that define the nature of the structure. This basic view of causality in complex systems suggests an approach to defining a statistical mechanics for ecological systems that can be used to generate new theoretical descriptions of biological diversity. This approach is illustrated by introducing the idea of a ※geographic population system§ of a species and illustrating how change and constraints interact within this system to determine statistical properties such as geographic range size, and mean-variance scalings. The concept of a geographic population system is then used to develop alternative descriptions of the kinetics of biological diversity. Assuming that these alternatives are complimentary, it is possible to develop a general description for biological diversity that shows how lower level change (geographical population dynamics of species) are constrained by the environment and genetic systems of species to determine rates of origination and extinction of taxa over long periods of time."
Advanced nonlinear dynamic modelling of bi-stable composite plates,"Zhangming Wu, Hao Li, Michael I. Friswell, ","Composite Structures, Volume 201, 1 October 2018, Pages 582-596, ","This paper proposes a novel analytical model to study the nonlinear dynamics of cross-ply bi-stable composite plates. Based on Hamilton＊s principle, in conjunction with the Rayleigh-Ritz method, an advanced analytical model with only 17 unknown terms is developed to predict the entire nonlinear dynamic response of bi-stable composite plates, which are excited by an electrodynamic shaker. The coupling between the bi-stable plate and the shaker is considered in the development of the analytical model. This work, for the first time, simulates the full dynamics of bi-stable plates using an analytical model, including the prediction of the nonlinear characteristics of single well vibration and cross well vibration. Numerical results on three vibrational patterns of two standard cross-ply composite plates are obtained to study the nonlinear dynamics of bi-stable plates. The prediction accuracy on the dynamic characteristics of different vibrational patterns of bi-stable plates are verified by both finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental results. Large amplitude cross-well vibrations due to the transitions between different stable states of bi-stable plates are also characterized accurately. Applying this 17-term analytical model for the dynamic analysis of bi-stable plates is straightforward, as the mass and stiffness properties are obtained directly from the geometry and material properties. Only the damping coefficients for different plates need to be determined from experiments. Furthermore, this proposed 17-term analytical model has much higher computational efficiency than FEA."
Genome-wide Analyses Identify KIF5A as a Novel ALS Gene,"Aude Nicolas, Kevin P. Kenna, Alan E. Renton, Nicola Ticozzi, John E. Landers, ","Neuron, Volume 97, Issue 6, 21 March 2018, Pages 1268-1283.e6, ","To identify novel genes associated with ALS, we undertook two lines of investigation. We carried out a genome-wide association study comparing 20,806 ALS cases and 59,804 controls. Independently, we performed a rare variant burden analysis comparing 1,138 index familial ALS cases and 19,494 controls. Through both approaches, we identified kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) as a novel gene associated with ALS. Interestingly, mutations predominantly in the N-terminal motor domain of KIF5A are causative for two neurodegenerative diseases: hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG10) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (CMT2). In contrast, ALS-associated mutations are primarily located at the C-terminal cargo-binding tail domain and patients harboring loss-of-function mutations displayed an extended survival relative to typical ALS cases. Taken together, these results broaden the phenotype spectrum resulting from mutations in KIF5A and strengthen the role of cytoskeletal defects in the pathogenesis of ALS."
Node-securing connectivity-based model to reduce infection spread in contaminated networks,"Gokhan Karakose, Ronald G.

These models utilize a connectivity-based metric, in which a susceptible node is assumed to be at risk of infection if there exists a transmission path between it and any infected node, where no transmission path exists between two nodes if every path between them includes at least one secured node. The initial model presented, which is to the authors＊ knowledge the first node-securing connectivity-based model for mitigating the spread of infection in contaminated networks, is then reformulated by use of a novel search space reduction algorithm. Computational testing is presented demonstrating the significant reductions in solution time achieved by the reformulated model."

The accident scene is based on the evolution of the scene, the establishment of Bayesian network based on multi-factor disaster accident model. Based on the actual case and the established model, the risk of disaster control in the oil and gas storage tank area is analyzed.

Acceptability measurement and priority weight elicitation of triangular fuzzy multiplicative preference relations based on geometric consistency and uncertainty indices,"Zhou-Jing Wang, Jian Lin, ","Information Sciences, Volume 402, September 2017, Pages 105-123, ","This paper investigates consistency and uncertainty measurements as well as acceptability checking for triangular fuzzy multiplicative preference relations (TFMPRs). A geometric consistency index is proposed to measure the consistency degree of a TFMPR, and thresholds of acceptable consistency are discussed for TFMPRs. Uncertainty indices are introduced to measure indeterminacy degrees of triangular fuzzy judgments and of TFMPRs and a notion of acceptable TFMPRs are put forward by considering both acceptable consistency and acceptable uncertainty in TFMPRs. We also explore the elicitation of triangular fuzzy weights from acceptable TFMPRs and the aggregation of local triangular fuzzy weights for solving hierarchical multi-criteria decision-making problems. A geometric mean-based equation and a logarithmic least square model are developed to elicit normalized acceptable triangular fuzzy multiplicative weights from an acceptable TFMPR. An equation and a linear program are established to transform triangular fuzzy multiplicative weights into triangular fuzzy additive weights. A geometric weighting-based equation and a pair of linear programs are devised to generate global priority fuzzy weights from local triangular fuzzy multiplicative weights. Three numerical examples, including a hierarchical multi-criteria decision-making problem, are used to illustrate how to apply the developed framework, and comparative studies are provided to show its availability and advantages."
A non-parametric approach to extending generic binary classifiers for multi-classification,"Venkataraman Santhanam, Vlad I. Morariu, David Harwood, Larry S.

In particular, we consider the one-vs-one decomposition of the multi-class problem, where binary classifier models are trained to discriminate every class pair. We describe a robust multi-classification pipeline, which at a high level involves projecting binary classifier scores into compact orthogonal subspaces, followed by a non-linear probabilistic multi-classification step, using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). We compare our approach against state-of-the-art ensemble methods (DCS, DRCW) on 16 multi-class datasets. We also compare against the most commonly used ensemble methods (VOTE, NEST) on 6 real-world computer vision datasets. Finally, we measure the statistical significance of our approach using non-parametric tests.

Visual loss in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and optic pathway gliomas: Relation to tumor location by magnetic resonance imaging,"Laura J Balcer, Grant T Liu, Gordon Heller, Larissa Bilaniuk, Maureen G Maguire, ","American Journal of Ophthalmology, Volume 131, Issue 4, April 2001, Pages 442-445, ","PURPOSE: To examine the potential for visual acuity loss, and its relation to extent and location of optic pathway gliomas in a cohort of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 studied with magnetic resonance imaging.METHODS: We reviewed the neuro-ophthalmologic records and brain/orbital magnetic resonance imaging scans for 43 consecutive pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and optic pathway gliomas who were followed at the Children＊s Hospital of Philadelphia. The presence of visual loss, defined as abnormal visual acuity for age in one or both eyes, was determined. Optic pathway gliomas were classified by tumor extent and location according to involvement of the optic nerves, chiasm, and postchiasmal structures by magnetic resonance imaging.RESULTS: Involvement of the optic tracts and other postchiasmal structures at tumor diagnosis was associated with a significantly higher probability of visual acuity loss (P = .048, chi-square test). Visual loss was noted in 20 of 43 patients (47%) at a median age of 4 years; however, three patients developed visual acuity loss for the first time during adolescence.CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and optic pathway gliomas, the likelihood of visual loss is dependent on the extent and location of the tumor by magnetic resonance imaging and is particularly associated with involvement of postchiasmal structures. Furthermore, older age during childhood (adolescence) does not preclude the occurrence of visual loss. Close follow-up beyond the early childhood years, particularly for those with postchiasmal tumor, is recommended."

Pedestrian fatality and injury data were obtained from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration＊s Fatality Analysis Reporting System and National Automotive Sampling System General Estimates System. Frequencies of fatalities, injuries, and associated characteristics were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for risk of fatality, controlling for demographic and crash-related factors.There were 47,789 pedestrian fatalities and 674,414 injuries during the 10-year study period. Fatality rates were highest among the elderly aged 85 years and older (2.95/100,000 population), whereas injury rates were highest for those aged 15每19 years (35.23/100,000 population). Predictors associated with increased risk for death include the following: male sex (AOR=1.36, 95% CI=1.15, 1.62), age ≡65 years (AOR=3.44, 95% CI=2.62, 4.50), alcohol involvement (AOR=2.63, 95% CI=1.88, 3.67), collisions after midnight (AOR=5.21, 95% CI=3.20, 8.49), at non-intersections (AOR=2.76, 95% CI=2.21, 3.45), and involving trucks (AOR=2.15, 95% CI=1.16, 3.97) and buses (AOR=5.82, 95% CI=3.67, 9.21).Potentially modifiable factors are associated with increased risk of death after pedestrian每motor vehicle collisions.

Foundation theories of solute transport in porous media: a critical review,"Garrison Sposito, Vijay K Gupta, R. N Bhattacharya, ","Advances in Water Resources, Volume 2, March 1979, Pages 59-68, ","The theories that have been employed to derive the macroscopic differential equations that describe solute transport through porous media are reviewed critically. These foundational theories may be grouped into three classes: (1) those based in fluid mechanics, (2) those based in kinematic approaches employing the mathematics of the theory of Markov processes, and (3) those based in a formal analogy between statistical thermodynamics and hydrodynamic dispersion. It is shown that the theories of class 1 have had to employ highly artificial models of a porous medium in order to produce a well-defined velocity field in the pore space that can be analysed rigorously or have had to assume that well-defined solutions of the equations of fluid mechanics exist in the pore space of a natural porous medium and then adopt an ad hoc definition of the solute difusivity tensor. The theories of class 2 do not require the validity of fluid mechanics but they suffer from the absence of a firm dynamical basis, at the molecular level, for the stochastic properties they attribute to the velocity of a solute molecule, or they ignore dynamics altogether and make kinematic assumptions directly on the position process of a solute molecule. The theories of class 3 have been purely formal in nature, with an unclear physical content, or have been no different in content from empirically based theories that make use of the analogy between heat and matter flow at the macroscopic level. It is concluded that none of the existing foundational theories has yet achieved the objectives of: (1) deriving, in a physically meaningful and mathematically rigorous fashion, the macroscopic differential equations of solute transport theory, and (2) elucidating the structure of the empirical coefficients appearing in these equations."

Implementation of conjunctive and disjunctive fuzzy logic rules with neural networks,"James M. Keller, Hossein Tahani, ","International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, Volume 6, Issue 2, February 1992, Pages 221-240, ","The use of fuzzy logic to model and manage uncertainty in a rule-based system places high computational demands on an inference engine. In an earlier paper, we introduced trainable neural network structures for fuzzy logic. These networks can learn and extrapolate complex relationships between possibility distributions for the antecedents and consequents in the rules. In this paper, the power of these networks is further explored. The sensitivity of the output to noisy input distributions (which are likely if the clauses are generated from real data) is demonstrated as well as the ability of the networks to internalize multiple conjunctive clause and disjunctive clause rules. Since different rules (with the same variables) can be encoded in a single network, this approach to fuzzy logic inference provides a natural mechanism for rule conflict resolution."

G-CSF exerts dual effects on endothelial cells〞Opposing actions of direct eNOS induction versus indirect CRP elevation,"Kyung-Woo Park, Yoo-Wook Kwon, Hyun-Jai Cho, Jung-Im Shin, Hyo-Soo Kim, ","Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology, Volume 45, Issue 5, November 2008, Pages 670-678, ","Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been shown to have protective effects in the heart and brain. However, it may also be involved in the acute inflammatory response which may be harmful. The effects of G-CSF on endothelial cells (ECs) and the vasculature are mostly unknown. To study the possible dual effects of G-CSF on ECs, we investigated whether G-CSF induces release of C-reactive protein (CRP) by hepatocytes and whether the direct beneficial effects of G-CSF could protect ECs from the detrimental effects of CRP. G-CSF treatment significantly induced monocytes to produce IL-6, and culture supernatants of G-CSF-stimulated monocytes induced CRP production in hepatocytes. On the other hand, G-CSF directly promoted EC proliferation and migration and reversed the deleterious effects of CRP. In mechanistic analyses, G-CSF increased not only the protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), but also its transcription. Furthermore, it enhanced eNOS phosphorylation and activation, leading to increased production of NO. Thus, G-CSF reversed the attenuated production of NO by CRP. These effects of G-CSF on eNOS transcription, translation, and activation were blunted by the PI3K inhibitor, suggesting that EC protective effects of G-CSF were associated with the activation of the Akt/eNOS pathway. In conclusion, although G-CSF induces an inflammatory reaction leading to CRP production, it has direct beneficial effects protecting ECs from the deleterious effects of CRP through activation of Akt/eNOS pathway, leading to an increase in NO production. Our data suggests that G-CSF may exert dual opposing effects on endothelial cells."

Previously, there have been studies of the risks and consequences of Pu-238 release in postulated accidents including, for example, the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) for the Galileo Mission. Since this report used an ICRP-30 based model, and a later ICRP-66 model has become available, it is of interest to re-evaluate the previous results for Pu-238 and obtain new results for Am-241. We are reporting here the following results of calculations for inhalation doses using our own computational programs (as based on different models). The results include committed equivalent doses for Pu-238 particles using the Galileo FSAR model, the original ICRP-30 model, and the ICRP-66 model. We also calculated committed equivalent dose for Am-241 using the ICRP-66 model. The ICRP-30 and ICRP-66 results were obtained using assumptions of committed time and resuspension taken from the FSAR. We have found that the ICRP-66 predicts lower doses for Pu-238 than those predicted by the Galileo FSAR or ICRP-30. Also we have found that the Am-241 lung doses are lower than those of Pu-238 because of greater clearance of Am-241 from the lungs as compared with Pu-238."

The chain of bundle model is developed, which is based on a stochastic material model by Weibull and lognormal distribution. Furthermore, this model is embedded into the finite element method (FEM) software for the analysis of a complicated structure with a stress gradient. In order to determine the stochastic material model parameters, uniaxial tensile tests were carried out based on specimens using the same steel with different sizes. By comparing the experimental and simulation results, the material parameters could be analyzed based on the relationship between the specimen sizes and strength. Moreover, the 3-point and 4-point bending tests were performed and simulated with the developed model. The experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the SSE also exists in the flexural member, and the equivalent yield stress is closely related to the stress distribution and volume of the structure component."

The increase in the apparent rate coefficient for desorption with increasing pressure can be ascribed to the effects of repulsive lateral interactions on the activation energy for desorption. The simulated kinetics are in good agreement with the experimentally-observed kinetics for the isothermal desorption of CO from polycrystalline Pd and for the temperature-programmed desorption of CO from Ni(100)."

Radiologic study and magnetic resonance imaging showed a homogeneous enhancing mass, 1.6 ℅ 0.5 ℅ 1.1 cm in size, in the left CPA cistern region with mild extension to the left internal auditory canal. The tumor was removed through left retromastoid craniectomy, and the histopathologic diagnosis of the tumor was confirmed as diffuse large B-cell type malignant lymphoma. After a series of tumor surveys, there was no evidence of other original lymphoma. The patient was treated with chemotherapy (including intra-Ommaya injection with methotrexate and Ara-C and systemic injection with vincristine, methotrexate and ifosfamide) for the primary CPA lymphoma. He was still alive 19 months after the initial treatment."
Does growth rate in spatial ability matter in predicting early arithmetic competence?,"Xiao Zhang, Dan Lin, ","Learning and Instruction, Volume 49, June 2017, Pages 232-241, ","There is a well-established relation between overall level of spatial ability and mathematics competence: people who are stronger in the former perform better on tests of the latter. However, does the rate of growth in spatial ability also matter? This longitudinal study of Chinese children (aged three to six) demonstrated that growth rate in spatial perception during the preschool years significantly predicted arithmetic competence at the end of preschool. This effect was over and above the overall levels of spatial perception and spatial reasoning and the level and rate of growth in phonological awareness. The findings highlight the need to provide spatial learning opportunities for preschoolers whose rate of growth in this skill is slower than that of their peers."
Dynamic Simulation of the Group Behavior under Fire Accidents Based on System Dynamics,"Jian Song, Ming-guang Zhang, Feng Zheng, Fu-zhen Chen, ","Procedia Engineering, Volume 211, 2018, Pages 635-643, ","In order to study the group behavior under severe fire accidents in chemical industrial park, a model of the group behavior was built based on the epidemic model and the system dynamics (SD) theory and method. The influencing factors were selected through analysis of previous research. And taking the group behavior as the main research object, the causality relationships and model between the influencing factors were analyzed. On this basis, system dynamics software vensim was applied to finish dynamic simulation, then dealt with the influence of the group behavior in the change of government credibility, public sentiment and influence of events. The simulation results show that improving the government credibility would increase the public＊s satisfaction and trust to the government. At the same time, it is an important measure to deal with the group behavior by easing public sentiment and reducing influence of events. It provides a basis method for group behavior management related to fire accidents in chemical industrial park."
Experimental study of occupancy-based control of HVAC zones,"Siddharth Goyal, Prabir Barooah, Timothy Middelkoop, ","Applied Energy, Volume 140, 15 February 2015, Pages 75-84, ","We present experimental evaluation of two occupancy-based control strategies for HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) systems in commercial buildings that were proposed in our earlier simulation work. We implement these strategies in a test-zone of Pugh Hall at the University of Florida campus. By comparing their performance against a conventional baseline controller (that does not use real-time occupancy measurements) on days when exogenous inputs〞such as weather〞are similar, we establish the energy savings potential for each of these strategies. The two control strategies are of vastly different complexity: one is a rule-based feedback controller while the other is based on MPC (model predictive control) that requires real-time optimization based on dynamic models. The results of the evaluation are consistent with those of our prior simulation work, that (i) both occupancy based controllers yield substantial energy savings over the baseline controller without sacrificing thermal comfort and indoor air quality, and (ii) the much higher complexity MPC controller yields negligible benefit over the simple rule-based feedback controller. The experimental evaluation provides further confidence that high degree of energy savings is possible with simple control algorithms that use real-time occupancy measurements."
A numerical method for shock driven multiphase flow with evaporating particles,"Jeevan Dahal, Jacob A. McFarland, ","Journal of Computational Physics, Volume 344, 1 September 2017, Pages 210-233, ","A numerical method for predicting the interaction of active, phase changing particles in a shock driven flow is presented in this paper. The Particle-in-Cell (PIC) technique was used to couple particles in a Lagrangian coordinate system with a fluid in an Eulerian coordinate system. The Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) hydrodynamics solver was used for solving the conservation equations and was modified with mass, momentum, and energy source terms from the particle phase. The method was implemented in the open source hydrodynamics software FLASH, developed at the University of Chicago. A simple validation of the methods is accomplished by comparing velocity and temperature histories from a single particle simulation with the analytical solution. Furthermore, simple single particle parcel simulations were run at two different sizes to study the effect of particle size on vorticity deposition in a shock-driven multiphase instability. Large particles were found to have lower enstrophy production at early times and higher enstrophy dissipation at late times due to the advection of the particle vorticity source term through the carrier gas. A 2D shock-driven instability of a circular perturbation is studied in simulations and compared to previous experimental data as further validation of the numerical methods. The effect of the particle size distribution and particle evaporation is examined further for this case. The results show that larger particles reduce the vorticity deposition, while particle evaporation increases it. It is also shown that for a distribution of particles sizes the vorticity deposition is decreased compared to single particle size case at the mean diameter."
Efficient frontiers in a frontier state: Viability of mobile dentistry services in rural areas,"Andreas Thorsen, Ronald G. McGarvey, ","European Journal of Operational Research, Volume 268, Issue 3, 1 August 2018, Pages 1062-1076, ","This study investigates the implications of adding mobile dentistry services to a community health center (CHC) in a rural area. CHCs are not-for-profit healthcare organizations which provide comprehensive primary care services to patients in the US, primarily for under-served and uninsured populations. We estimate the demand for the service in a five-county region in southwestern Montana, USA and work with stakeholders to determine a set of potential service locations. A mixed-integer optimization model is formulated to determine the frequency of stops in each location over a finite (six month) planning horizon with the goal of improving accessibility and availability of dental services while maintaining financial sustainability of the CHC. The financial considerations and social impact of offering a mobile dentistry service in southwestern Montana are assessed. Computational results based on a case study demonstrate the challenges facing mobile dentistry operations to increase access to under-served populations in a financially viable manner. Hybrid solutions, in which care is offered at a mix of fixed locations and mobile locations, appear to best balance the objectives of financial sustainability and expanded access to care."

TCGA clinical data contain key features representing the democratized nature of the data collection process. To ensure proper use of this large clinical dataset associated with genomic features, we developed a standardized dataset named the TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource (TCGA-CDR), which includes four major clinical outcome endpoints. In addition to detailing major challenges and statistical limitations encountered during the effort of integrating the acquired clinical data, we present a summary that includes endpoint usage recommendations for each cancer type. These TCGA-CDR findings appear to be consistent with cancer genomics studies independent of the TCGA effort and provide opportunities for investigating cancer biology using clinical correlates at an unprecedented scale.Download high-res image (207KB)Download full-size image"
Evaluation of eight high spatial resolution gridded precipitation products in Adige Basin (Italy) at multiple temporal and spatial scales,"Zheng Duan, Junzhi Liu, Ye Tuo, Gabriele Chiogna, Markus Disse, ","Science of The Total Environment, Volume 573, 15 December 2016, Pages 1536-1553, ","This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of eight high spatial resolution gridded precipitation products in Adige Basin located in Italy within 45每47.1∼N. The Adige Basin is characterized by a complex topography, and independent ground data are available from a network of 101 rain gauges during 2000每2010. The eight products include the Version 7 TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42 product, three products from CMORPH (the Climate Prediction Center MORPHing technique), i.e., CMORPH_RAW, CMORPH_CRT and CMORPH_BLD, PCDR (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record), PGF (Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset for land surface modelling developed by Princeton University), CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) and GSMaP_MVK (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation project Moving Vector with Kalman-filter product). All eight products are evaluated against interpolated rain gauge data at the common 0.25∼ spatial resolution, and additional evaluations at native finer spatial resolution are conducted for CHIRPS (0.05∼) and GSMaP_MVK (0.10∼). Evaluation is performed at multiple temporal (daily, monthly and annual) and spatial scales (grid and watershed). Evaluation results show that in terms of overall statistical metrics the CHIRPS, TRMM and CMORPH_BLD comparably rank as the top three best performing products, while the PGF performs worst. All eight products underestimate and overestimate the occurrence frequency of daily precipitation for some intensity ranges. All products tend to show higher error in the winter months (December每February) when precipitation is low. Very slight difference can be observed in the evaluation metrics and aspects between at the aggregated 0.25∼ spatial resolution and at the native finer resolutions (0.05∼) for CHIRPS and (0.10∼) for GSMaP_MVK products. This study has implications for precipitation product development and the global view of the performance of various precipitation products, and provides valuable guidance when choosing alternative precipitation data for local community.Download high-res image (364KB)Download full-size image"

Effects of melt treatment temperature and isothermal holding parameter on water-quenched microstructures of A356 aluminum alloy semisolid slurry,"Ming LI, Yuan-dong LI, Guang-li BI, Xiao-feng HUANG, Ying MA, ","Transactions of Nonferrous Metals Society of China, Volume 28, Issue 3, March 2018, Pages 393-403, ","The semisolid slurry of the A356 aluminum alloy was prepared by self-inoculation method (SIM), the effects of melt treatment temperatures and isothermal holding parameters on water-quenched microstructures of A356 aluminum alloy semisolid slurry were investigated, and the solidification behavior of the remaining liquid phase (secondary solidification) was analyzed. The results indicate that the melt treatment temperature has significant effects on the final semisolid microstructures. The semisolid slurry which is suitable for the rheological forming can be produced when the melt treatment temperature is between 680 and 690 ∼C. During the isothermal holding process, the growth rate of the primary particles conforms to the dynamic equation of Dt3每D03=Kt, and the coarsening rate of the primary particles is the fastest when the isothermal holding temperature is 600 ∼C. Additionally, the isothermal holding time also has obvious effect on the secondary solidification microstructures. The secondary particles are the smallest and roundest when the isothermal holding time is 3 min. The amount of the secondary particles gradually increases with the increase of isothermal holding temperature, and the eutectic reaction therefore is confined into small intergranular areas, contributing to the compactness of the final solidified eutectic structures."
Biophysical Properties of 污C-Crystallin in Human and Mouse Eye Lens: The Role of Molecular Dipoles,"Andrew G. Purkiss, Orval A. Bateman, Keith Wyatt, Phillip A. Wilmarth, Christine Slingsby, ","Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 372, Issue 1, 7 September 2007, Pages 205-222, ","The eye lens is packed with soluble crystallin proteins, providing a lifetime of transparency and light refraction. 污-Crystallins are major components of the dense, high refractive index central regions of the lens and generally have high solubility, high stability and high levels of cysteine residues. Human 污C belongs to a group of 污-crystallins with a pair of cysteine residues at positions 78 and 79. Unlike other 污-crystallins it has relatively low solubility, whereas mouse 污C, which has the exposed C79 replaced with arginine, and a novel mouse splice variant, 污Cins, are both highly soluble. Furthermore, human 污C is extremely stable, while the mouse orthologs are less stable. Evolutionary pressure may have favoured stability over solubility for human 污C and the reverse for the orthologs in the mouse. Mutation of C79 to R79, in human 污C, greatly increased solubility, however, neither form produced crystals. Remarkably, when the human 污D R36S crystallization cataract mutation was mimicked in human 污C-crystallin, the solubility of 污C was dramatically increased, although it still did not crystallize. The highly soluble mouse 污C-crystallin did crystallize. Its X-ray structure was solved and used in homology modelling of human 污C, and its mutants C79R and R36S. The human 污D R36S mutant was also modelled from human 污D coordinates. Molecular dynamics simulation of the six molecules in the solution state showed that the human 污Cs differed from 污Ds in domain pairing, behaviour that correlates with interface sequence changes. When the fluctuations of the calculated molecular dipoles, for the six structures, over time were analysed, characteristic patterns for soluble 污C and 污D proteins were observed. Individual sequence changes that increase or decrease solubility correlated well with changes in the magnitude and direction of these dipoles. It is suggested that changes in surface residues have allowed adaptation for the differing needs of human and mouse lenses."
Store depletion-induced h-channel plasticity rescues a channelopathy linked to Alzheimer＊s disease,"Timothy F. Musial, Elizabeth Molina-Campos, Linda A. Bean, Natividad Ybarra, Daniel A. Nicholson, ","Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, Volume 154, October 2018, Pages 141-157, ","Voltage-gated ion channels are critical for neuronal integration. Some of these channels, however, are misregulated in several neurological disorders, causing both gain- and loss-of-function channelopathies in neurons. Using several transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer＊s disease (AD), we find that sub-threshold voltage signals strongly influenced by hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels progressively deteriorate over chronological aging in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. The degraded signaling via HCN channels in the transgenic mice is accompanied by an age-related global loss of their non-uniform dendritic expression. Both the aberrant signaling via HCN channels and their mislocalization could be restored using a variety of pharmacological agents that target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Our rescue of the HCN channelopathy helps provide molecular details into the favorable outcomes of ER-targeting drugs on the pathogenesis and synaptic/cognitive deficits in AD mouse models, and implies that they might have beneficial effects on neurological disorders linked to HCN channelopathies."
A molecular approach to the foundations of the theory of solute transport in porous media: I. Conservative solutes in homogeneous isotropic saturated media,"Vijay K. Gupta, R. N. Bhattacharya, Garrison Sposito, ","Journal of Hydrology, Volume 50, 1981, Pages 355-370, ","A molecular model is developed for the transport of a conservative solute at low concentrations in a homogeneous isotropic water-saturated porous medium. In this model, a solute molecule undergoes contact collisions with the solid grains in the medium at successive random times; in between these collisions, the velocity of the molecule is governed by the Langevin equation; the effect of the collisions with the solid grains is to scatter a molecule in a random direction. This molecular model is employed to derive rigorously a parabolic differential equation for the solute concentration at the macroscopic level. In the absence of solute convection, the coefficient of molecular diffusion in a porous medium is proved to be less than the coefficient of molecular diffusion in bulk solution, a finding which is in agreement with experimental observations. For non-zero convection, the assumption of isotropicity of the medium is employed to prove that the solute dispersion tensor is diagonal. For small magnitudes of the liquid velocity, the isotropicity assumption also implies that the coefficients of longitudinal and transverse dispersion are approximately parabolic functions of the liquid velocity. The expressions derived for the dispersion coefficients, when compared with their experimentally observed values, suggest that their dependence on the liquid velocity comes primarily through solute〞liquid molecular collisions instead of through collisions of the solute molecules with the grains of the solid phase. The solute convective velocity is shown to be less than or equal to the liquid velocity. Precisely when the difference between the two velocities will be significant remains to be established."

Little is known about potential adverse effects of DHEA when consumed on an acute or chronic basis. We report a case of mania in an older man acutely admitted to our psychiatric facility with no previous personal or family history of bipolar disorder that appeared to be related to recent DHEA use. The patient had initiated DHEA use 6 months prior to admission and was taking 200每300 mg/day at the time of presentation.Methods: He was treated with valproic acid 500 mg twice daily.Results: The patient showed sufficient improvement to be discharged following a 7-day inpatient hospitalization.Conclusions: A wide range of medications have been associated with the induction of hypomania and mania, and we have provided a brief discussion of the potential for DHEA to trigger manic symptoms."
Backpropagation neural networks for fuzzy logic,"James M. Keller, Hossein Tahani, ","Information Sciences, Volume 62, Issue 3, August 1992, Pages 205-221, ","Expert systems play a crucial role in the application of artificial intelligence to real problems. There are numerous methods of dealing with uncertainty in expert systems. Fuzzy logic is one such approach, in which the uncertainty is represented by possibility distributions for the antecedents and consequent of a rule. An uncertain input can be propagated to the consequent by a variety of mechanisms. This generality results in a higher computational burden for the system. More importantly, a means of controlling the response of the system to variations in input conditions is needed. In this paper, feedforward neural networks are proposed as a means of controlling this generality as well as providing the parallel computation necessary for fuzzy logic. It is demonstrated that these networks can learn and extrapolate complex relationships between antecedents and consequents for rules containing single and conjunctive antecedent clauses. Also, multiple compatible rules can be stored in a single network structure, increasing the efficiency of rule storage, and providing a natural mechanism for conflict resolution."
Air-side heat transfer enhancement in plate-fin channel with an airfoil-based self-agitator,"Kuojiang Li, Xianchen Xu, Zheng Li, Hsiu-Hung Chen, Chien-Hua Chen, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 128, January 2019, Pages 715-727, ","Airfoil-based self-agitators (AFAs) were installed in multiple plate-fin channels integrated with cantilever beams. The heat transfer enhancement and pressure drop characteristics of this AFA design were experimentally investigated and compared with the clean channel case. We found that the AFA vibrates periodically and generates vortices, which enhance flow mixing and thus heat transfer performance. A rectangular shaped airfoil-based self-agitator (RAFA) and a delta shaped airfoil-based self-agitator (DAFA) with variable chord lengths were designed to investigate shape and size effects on thermal performance. Measurements were also carried out for DAFAs with different layouts, such as multiple rows of DAFAs installed inside a single channel. For the chosen heat sink and assigned working conditions, the best heat transfer performance was obtained with four rows of DAFAs, which caused an 80% increase in overall Nusselt number over the clean channel at the same Reynolds number and a 50% rejected heat increase at the same pumping power due to the strong longitudinal vortices generated by the presence of the AFAs."
Multi-objective optimization for designing a composite sandwich structure under normal and 45∼ impact loadings,"Yuan Chen, Kunkun Fu, Shujuan Hou, Xu Han, Lin Ye, ","Composites Part B: Engineering, Volume 142, 1 June 2018, Pages 159-170, ","With their lightweight character and high energy absorption capacity, composite sandwich structures have attracted increasing attention in the transportation industry. The aim of this work is to present a new approach to investigate and optimize a composite sandwich structure by taking into account both normal and 45∼ low-speed impact loadings. First, a finite element model considering elastic-plastic, damage, and failure behaviours of the composites by using continuum damage mechanics is developed and validated by a normal low-speed impact test. Second, dynamic effects of normal and 45∼ impacts on energy absorption and failure behaviours of the composite sandwich structures are investigated. Then, a parametric study is performed to systematically understand the influences of core depth and cell thickness on the impact resistance of the sandwich composite structures subjected to both normal and 45∼ impacts. In contrast to their metal counterparts, it is interestingly found that absorbed energy generally increases with cell thickness, with a small extent of fluctuation, whereas core depth jumps, and the energy absorption capacity remains almost steady under normal impact but varies irregularly under the 45∼ impact. Afterwards, a multi-objective optimization is performed to enhance the energy absorption under both normal and 45∼ loadings. The energy absorption capability of the optimal composite sandwich structure can remarkably be improved by 12.447% for normal impact, and 7.9% for 45∼ impact. This method provides a new manner and systematic guidance for designing a lightweight composite sandwich structure more practical for engineering application."
"Nations within a nation: variations in epidemiological transition across the states of India, 1990每2016 in the Global Burden of Disease Study","India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Collaborators, ","The Lancet, Volume 390, Issue 10111, 2每8 December 2017, Pages 2437-2460, ","18% of the world's population lives in India, and many states of India have populations similar to those of large countries. Action to effectively improve population health in India requires availability of reliable and comprehensive state-level estimates of disease burden and risk factors over time. Such comprehensive estimates have not been available so far for all major diseases and risk factors. Thus, we aimed to estimate the disease burden and risk factors in every state of India as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2016.Using all available data sources, the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative estimated burden (metrics were deaths, disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs], prevalence, incidence, and life expectancy) from 333 disease conditions and injuries and 84 risk factors for each state of India from 1990 to 2016 as part of GBD 2016. We divided the states of India into four epidemiological transition level (ETL) groups on the basis of the ratio of DALYs from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNDs) to those from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries combined in 2016. We assessed variations in the burden of diseases and risk factors between ETL state groups and between states to inform a more specific health-system response in the states and for India as a whole.DALYs due to NCDs and injuries exceeded those due to CMNNDs in 2003 for India, but this transition had a range of 24 years for the four ETL state groups. The age-standardised DALY rate dropped by 36﹞2% in India from 1990 to 2016. The numbers of DALYs and DALY rates dropped substantially for most CMNNDs between 1990 and 2016 across all ETL groups, but rates of reduction for CMNNDs were slowest in the low ETL state group. By contrast, numbers of DALYs increased substantially for NCDs in all ETL state groups, and increased significantly for injuries in all ETL state groups except the highest. The all-age prevalence of most leading NCDs increased substantially in India from 1990 to 2016, and a modest decrease was recorded in the age-standardised NCD DALY rates. The major risk factors for NCDs, including high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, high total cholesterol, and high body-mass index, increased from 1990 to 2016, with generally higher levels in higher ETL states; ambient air pollution also increased and was highest in the low ETL group. The incidence rate of the leading causes of injuries also increased from 1990 to 2016. The five leading individual causes of DALYs in India in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, and cerebrovascular disease; and the five leading risk factors for DALYs in 2016 were child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. Behind these broad trends many variations existed between the ETL state groups and between states within the ETL groups. Of the ten leading causes of disease burden in India in 2016, five causes had at least a five-times difference between the highest and lowest state-specific DALY rates for individual causes.Per capita disease burden measured as DALY rate has dropped by about a third in India over the past 26 years. However, the magnitude and causes of disease burden and the risk factors vary greatly between the states. The change to dominance of NCDs and injuries over CMNNDs occurred about a quarter century apart in the four ETL state groups. Nevertheless, the burden of some of the leading CMNNDs continues to be very high, especially in the lowest ETL states. This comprehensive mapping of inequalities in disease burden and its causes across the states of India can be a crucial input for more specific health planning for each state as is envisioned by the Government of India's premier think tank, the National Institution for Transforming India, and the National Health Policy 2017.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Indian Council of Medical Research, Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India; and World Bank"
Primary outcomes of the Monitoring in Dialysis Study indicate that clinically significant arrhythmias are common in hemodialysis patients and related to dialytic cycle,"Prabir Roy-Chaudhury, Jim A. Tumlin, Bruce A. Koplan, Alexandru I. Costea, MiD investigators and committees, ","Kidney International, Volume 93, Issue 4, April 2018, Pages 941-951, ","Sudden death is one of the more frequent causes of death for hemodialysis patients, but the underlying mechanisms, contribution of arrhythmia, and associations with serum chemistries or the dialysis procedure are incompletely understood. To study this, implantable loop recorders were utilized for continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring to detect clinically significant arrhythmias including sustained ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, asystole, or symptomatic arrhythmias in hemodialysis patients over six months. Serum chemistries were tested pre- and post-dialysis at least weekly. Dialysis procedure data were collected at every session. Associations with clinically significant arrhythmias were assessed using negative binomial regression modeling. Sixty-six patients were implanted and 1678 events were recorded in 44 patients. The majority were bradycardias (1461), with 14 episodes of asystole and only one of sustained ventricular tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation, although not defined as clinically significant arrhythmias, was detected in 41% of patients. With thrice-weekly dialysis, the rate was highest during the first dialysis session of the week and was increased during the last 12 hours of each inter-dialytic interval, particularly the long interval. Among serum and dialytic parameters, only higher pre-dialysis serum sodium and dialysate calcium over 2.5 mEq/L were independently associated with clinically significant arrhythmias. Thus, clinically significant arrhythmias are common in hemodialysis patients, and bradycardia and asystole rather than ventricular tachycardia may be key causes of sudden death in hemodialysis patients. Associations with the temporal pattern of dialysis suggest that modification of current dialysis practices could reduce the incidence of sudden death."

Then, for catalyst-assisted VLS growth, Ni catalyst layers with thickness of a few nanometers were deposited on the graphene-coated substrates using a thermal evaporator. We investigated the effect of the Ni catalyst thickness on the formation of GaN nanowires. Furthermore, the structural and optical characteristics of GaN nanowires were investigated using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The GaN nanowires grown on graphene films were transferred onto polymer substrates using a simple lift-off method for applications as flexible photocatalysts. Photocatalysis activities of the GaN nanowires prepared on the flexible polymer substrates were investigated under bending conditions."
Pore size-controlled carbon aerogels for EDLC electrodes in organic electrolytes,"Inchan Yang, Sang-Gil Kim, Soon Hyung Kwon, Jun Hyup Lee, Ji Chul Jung, ","Current Applied Physics, Volume 16, Issue 6, June 2016, Pages 665-672, ","Pore size-controlled carbon aerogels (CA_X) are prepared from two starting materials: resorcinol and formaldehyde. Carbon aerogels with different pore sizes are successfully obtained by simply varying the polymerization time (X) in the polycondensation of resorcinol and formaldehyde. Pore sizes of the carbon aerogels monotonically increase with increasing polymerization time. The pore size of the carbon aerogel plays an important role in determining its electrochemical behavior (i.e., specific capacitance in EDLC) especially at high current density. A sufficiently large pore size in a carbon aerogel is required for easy transport of electrolyte ions, and these types of carbon aerogels provide excellent electrochemical performance as an EDLC electrode. CA_20, which was polymerized for the longest time, have the largest pore size and the largest pore volume. CA_20 exhibit the highest specific capacitance due to facile electrolyte ion transport. As a result, design of carbon aerogels with a sufficiently large pore size while maintaining a high specific surface area is very important for developing carbon aerogels for use in EDLC electrodes. In addition, we propose a schematic reaction pathway for the preparation of carbon aerogels in ambient conditions from resorcinol and formaldehyde using a base catalyst based on the characterization results.Download full-size image"
"A review of theoretical models of adsorption, diffusion, desorption, and reaction of gases on metal surfaces","Stephen J. Lombardo, Alexis T. Bell, ","Surface Science Reports, Volume 13, Issues 1每2, July 1991, Pages 3-72, ","A review is presented of the theoretical approaches available for describing the kinetics of gas adsorption, diffusion, desorption, and reaction on metal surfaces. The prediction of rate and diffusion coefficients based on molecular dynamics, transition-state theory, stochastic diffusion theory, and quantum mechanics is discussed, and the success of these theoretical approaches in representing experimental observation is examined. Consideration is also given to the effects of lateral interactions between adsorbates and to the ability of lattice-gas models to provide a representation of the dependences of rate and diffusion coefficients on adsorbate coverage. Finally, the utility of continuum and Monte Carlo models for describing the kinetics of complex surface processes in terms of elementary processes is addressed."
Design considerations for a pregnancy model for Warfarin,"Walter D. Wosilait, Richard H. Luecke, ","Mathematical and Computer Modelling, Volume 14, 1990, Pages 547-550, ","Pregnancy results not only in altered physiology in the mother, but in the formation of a placenta, the embryo, and the fetus, all of which exhibit progressive changes during pregnancy. The changes between fertilization and delivery of the fetus requires a suitable growth equation with parameters which can describe the growth of the fetus so that the weight or volume can be used at any time to calculate the volume of the organs for use in a physiological flow model. Such models describe the kinetics of distribution of xenobiotics between the mother, the placenta, and the embryo-fetus. Such information, during sensitive periods of development, can be used in the study of teratology."

Unobserved and observed heterogeneity in risk attitudes: Implications for valuing travel time savings and travel time variability,"Zheng Li, ","Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, Volume 112, April 2018, Pages 12-18, ","In this paper, we incorporate the attitude towards risk into a scheduling model to account for travel time variability, using a choice experiment of car commuters choosing from risky alternatives. The parameters that represent unobserved and observed heterogeneity in risk attitudes are jointly estimated within a non-linear utility framework. The model outputs are compared with the results from the model under the assumption of risk attitude homogeneity and we find differences in the willingness to pay for time savings and reduced travel time variability. These findings illustrate that risk attitude heterogeneity plays a role in choice behaviour."
Study on Optimization of Particular and Multi-Variable Structures by Wavelet Analysis,"Liang Liu, Yuyi Zhai, Hui Lin, ","Advances in Steel Structures (ICASS '99), Volume II, 1999, Pages 1089-1097, ","This chapter examines the optimization of particular and multivariable structures by Wavelet Analysis (WA). The infinitely differentiable function is either smooth or is not singular. In signal analysis, singular signals often carry important information, and the signals at sudden changed positions are called singular points of signals. The sudden change signal can be divided into: edge-jump changes and sudden changes of peak values. At the edge-jump change, there are maximum values for the antisymmetric WT, but the symmetric WT produces a crossing-zero point. For optimizations, the feasible ranges formed by constraint functions of optimization problems always exist for many points where the first derivation of function does not exist or the function is discontinuous. If the problem of structural optimization is Linear Programming (LP) when the weight of a structure is taken as an objective function, its optimal solutions (including local optimal solutions) are generally at the singular points. In Nonlinear programming (NLP), if global optimization is to be searched, the initial iteration point is selected, which may influence calculation speed and precision of the final results."
Phosphorothioate modification of the TLR9 ligand CpG ODN inhibits poly(I:C)-induced apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma by entry blockade,"Yuyi Zhang, Ang Lin, Qiangjun Sui, Cai Zhang, Jian Zhang, ","Cancer Letters, Volume 355, Issue 1, 1 December 2014, Pages 76-84, ","Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in the innate immune response and subsequent induction of adaptive immune responses. Recently, it has been noted that TLRs on tumor cells are involved in tumor development, and several TLR agonists, such as the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) and the TLR9 agonist CpG ODN, are being developed as vaccine adjuvants and cancer immunotherapeutics. In this study, we investigated whether combining poly(I:C) with a TLR9 agonist CpG ODN would result in a stronger anti-tumor effect on hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCs). Surprisingly, we found that simultaneous transfection of poly(I:C) and ODN M362 exhibited a lower pro-apoptotic effect on HCCs than transfection with poly(I:C) alone. Simultaneous co-transfection was accompanied by down-regulation of poly(I:C)-related innate receptors, pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic genes induced by poly(I:C), indicating that ODN M362 blocked the activation of poly(I:C)-triggered intrinsic immune responses and cellular apoptosis. Further studies indicated that these effects were partly due to the phosphorothioate-modification of CpG ODN, which blocked the entry of poly(I:C) into tumor cells. This entry blockade was avoided by administering poly(I:C) after CpG ODN. Moreover, poly(I:C)-mediated pro-apoptotic effects were enhanced in vitro and in vivo by pre-treating HCC cells with CpG ODN. Our findings thus suggest that when combining poly(I:C) and CpG ODN for cancer therapy, these agents should be used in an alternating rather than simultaneous manner to avoid the blocking effect of phosphorothioate-modified TLR9 ligands."
Risk Analysis on Domino Effect Caused by Pool Fire in Petroliferous Tank Farm,"Fu-zhen Chen, Ming-guang Zhang, Jian Song, Feng Zheng, ","Procedia Engineering, Volume 211, 2018, Pages 46-54, ","In the storage areas of petrochemical industry, the stored materials are flammable and explosive, and the layout of the tank farm is relatively tight that may lead to fire, explosion and even the domino accident. To analyze the domino effect of pool fire in tank farm, the Bayesian network is introduced and the coupling effects are taken into account. Based on the above theory, the domino effect propagation patterns and the occurrence probability of the domino accident at the first level and second level in a specific 2*2 tank farm are obtained. The posterior probabilities after considering new information are calculated by Netica software. And the minimum safety distance between the tanks is set to 31.17m. The results show that when there is only one tank occurs pool fire, the tank that far away is almost unaffected; correspondingly, when there are multiple thermal radiation fields, the occurrence possibility of domino accident has increased and the maximum escalation probability is 0.3632. Among them, when a pool fire occurs in tank farm, the adjacent tanks should be cooled to prevent the domino accident during rescue."
Structured inter-network collaboration: Public participation in tourism planning in Southern China,"Dan Lin, David Simmons, ","Tourism Management, Volume 63, December 2017, Pages 315-328, ","Public participation is considered a cornerstone of sustainable tourism planning.

Using a qualitative research strategy, this paper applies the theoretical construction of community participation in tourism planning to the analysis of the planning process of a tourism destination in Jiao Chang Wei, Shenzhen, China. The paper finds that: 1) public participation has played a significant role in the formulation and implementation of the tourism destination plan in the case study area. 2) Structuralized inter-network collaboration led-by government organized non-governmental organizations has the potential to become dominant paradigm of public participation in tourism planning in China in the future.

Surveillance in eradication and elimination of infectious diseases: A progression through the years,"David L. Heymann, Larry Brilliant, ","Vaccine, Volume 29, Supplement 4, 30 December 2011, Pages d141-d144, ","During the years since certification of smallpox eradication, the power of infectious disease surveillance has been greatly increased by new biotechnical and electronic technologies. These technologies have transformed the way that surveillance can be used to contribute to public health, and to infectious disease eradication and elimination. In addition to permitting precise geographical placement of infections by incorporating the most up to date geographical positioning systems, infectious disease surveillance can now also provide more comprehensive understanding of the spread and risks of infections because of genomic sequencing that leads to more meaningful epidemiological analysis. These new technologies have made infectious disease surveillance an even more powerful and timely tool than it was during the period of smallpox eradication. Future surveillance will continue to refine these technologies, and adapt newer ones such as rapid point of care diagnostics and hand held communication devices that will lead to more timely and accurate reporting from health facilities. These technologies will also lead to the possibility of direct participation in surveillance by individuals who will be able to report their own disease syndromes, those of their neighbors, or those of domestic and wild animals at the animal/human interface."

The photocatalytic activity of the Ag@AgBr/BiPO4/r-GO was evaluated by degrading reactive blue 19 (RB-19) under visible-light irradiation. The results showed that Ag@AgBr/BiPO4/r-GO composite exhibited much better photocatalytic performance than BiPO4 and Ag@AgBr/BiPO4 due to the efficient visible-light utilization. The construction of Z-scheme kept the photo-generated electrons and holes having high reduction and oxidation capabilities. Ag nanoparticles and r-GO acted as the electron mediators to form the charge transmission bridge for the AgBr/BiPO4 heterojunction, promoting the efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs and inhibiting the electron-hole recombination. Finally, a possible photocatalytic mechanism for the degradation of RB-19 by Ag@AgBr/BiPO4/r-GO was proposed based on the free radical and hole scavenging experiments.Download high-res image (210KB)Download full-size image"

1-Methylguanosine in Place of Y Base at Position 37 in Phenylalanine tRNA Is Responsible for Its Shiftiness in Retroviral Ribosomal Frameshifting,"Bradley A. Carlson, J. Frederic Mushinski, Darren W. Henderson, So Yeon Kwon, Dolph L. Hatfield, ","Virology, Volume 279, Issue 1, 5 January 2001, Pages 130-135, ","Many mammalian retroviruses express their protease and polymerase by ribosomal frameshifting. It was originally proposed that a specialized shifty tRNA promotes the frameshift event. We previously observed that phenylalanine tRNAPhe lacking the highly modified wybutoxosine (Y) base on the 3∩ side of its anticodon stimulated frameshifting, demonstrating that this tRNA is shifty. We now report the shifty tRNAPhe contains 1-methylguanosine (m1G) in place of Y and that the m1G form from rabbit reticulocytes stimulates frameshifting more efficiently than its m1G-containing counterpart from mouse neuroblastoma cells. The latter tRNA contains unmodified C and G nucleosides at positions 32 and 34, respectively, while the former tRNA contains the analogous 2∩-O-methylated nucleosides at these positions. The data suggest that not only does the loss of a highly modified base from the 3∩ side of the anticodon render tRNAPhe shifty, but the modification status of the entire anticodon loop contributes to the degree of shiftiness. Possible biological consequences of these findings are discussed."

The impact of metro accessibility on residential property values: An empirical analysis,"Zheng Li, ","Research in Transportation Economics, In press, corrected proof, Available online 18 July 2018, ","This paper investigates the influence of metro accessibility on Xi'an residential property values. The key finding is that proximity to metro stations tends to have a positive but nonlinear effect. Within two-kilometre road network distances from metro stations, property value uplift is lowest in areas immediately adjacent to metro stations, explained by negative externalities around metro stations outweighing accessibility gains. The highest effect is revealed at distances between 300 and 1200 metres away from stations. Other significant influences include the distance to the central business district, the size of the property, the age of the property, interior decoration, residential building type and geographical location. The evidence suggests that the catchment area size should be adjusted according to access mode shares. Policy implications are also provided for potential future decision making."

Cognitive precursors of word reading versus arithmetic competencies in young Chinese children,"Xiao Zhang, Dan Lin, ","Early Childhood Research Quarterly, Volume 42, 1st Quarter 2018, Pages 55-65, ","Word reading and arithmetic calculation are foundational to higher level reading (e.g., text comprehension) and mathematics (e.g., fraction), respectively. The present study aims to examine the similarities and differences in the cognitive precursors of word reading and arithmetic competencies in young Chinese children. A total of 75 Hong Kong Chinese children were tested first in the fall (T1) and then in the spring (T2) of their third kindergarten years. Competencies in Chinese word reading, including both single- and double-character word reading, and arithmetic calculation, including nonsymbolic arithmetic, arithmetic word problems, and written arithmetic, were assessed at both T1 and T2. Phonological awareness, orthographic awareness, rapid automatized naming (RAN), spatial perception, and spatial visualization were assessed at T1. The results showed that phonological awareness predicted later competencies in word reading and symbolic arithmetic, specifically arithmetic word problems and written arithmetic. RAN was predictive of later competencies in word reading and nonsymbolic arithmetic. Orthographic awareness was associated with later competencies in word reading but not arithmetic. Visual-spatial skills predicted later competencies in arithmetic word problems but not word reading. The findings suggest that similarities and differences both exist in the cognitive underpinnings of Chinese word reading and arithmetic competencies at a young age."
Usefulness of Microvolt T-Wave Alternans to Predict Outcomes in Patients With Ischemic Cardiomyopathy Beyond One Year,"Paul S. Chan, Dean J. Kereiakes, Cheryl Bartone, Theodore Chow, ","The American Journal of Cardiology, Volume 102, Issue 3, 1 August 2008, Pages 280-284, ","Previous studies have demonstrated that microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA) screening effectively risk-stratifies patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Whether the prognostic utility of MTWA diminishes over 3 years of follow-up remains unknown. In this study, a prospective cohort of 768 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction <35%) and no previous sustained ventricular arrhythmia was developed, of whom 514 (67%) screened MTWA nonnegative (positive and indeterminate). The mean follow-up period was 18 ㊣ 11 months. The primary end point was all-cause mortality and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks. Stratified Cox regression analyses (by implantable cardioverter-defibrillator status) estimated the predictive power of MTWA within each year of follow-up and determined whether this diminished over time. There were 99 deaths (MTWA negative: 21 [8.3%]; MTWA nonnegative: 78 [15.2%]) and 33 appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks (MTWA negative: 3 [4.0%]; MTWA nonnegative: 30 [9.5%]). After multivariate adjustment, a nonnegative MTWA test result was associated with a greater than twofold increased risk for events in each of the 3 years of follow-up (year 1: stratified hazard ratio 2.19, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 4.34, p = 0.03; year 2: stratified hazard ratio 3.36, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 8.83, p = 0.01; year 3: stratified hazard ratio 2.06, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 5.22, p = 0.13). There were no significant interactions between the time periods (year 1 vs year 2: p = 0.47; year 1 vs year 3: p = 0.92). In conclusion, MTWA reliably and consistently predicts mortality and arrhythmic risk throughout the first 2 to 3 years of follow-up. Although these findings need further validation, they suggest that rescreening with MTWA may not need to be performed more frequently than once every 2 years."
The challenge of regenerative therapies for the optic nerve in glaucoma,"David J. Calkins, Milos Pekny, Melissa L. Cooper, Larry Benowitz, The Lasker/IRRF Initiative on Astrocytes and Glaucomatous Neurodegeneration Participants, ","Experimental Eye Research, Volume 157, April 2017, Pages 28-33, ","This review arose from a discussion of regenerative therapies to treat optic nerve degeneration in glaucoma at the 2015 Lasker/IRRF Initiative on Astrocytes and Glaucomatous Neurodegeneration. In addition to the authors, participants included Jonathan Crowston, Andrew Huberman, Elaine Johnson, Richard Lu, Hemai Phatnami, Rebecca Sappington, and Don Zack. Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease of the optic nerve, and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. The disease progresses as sensitivity to intraocular pressure (IOP) is conveyed through the optic nerve head to distal retinal ganglion cell (RGC) projections. Because the nerve and retina are components of the central nervous system (CNS), their intrinsic regenerative capacity is limited. However, recent research in regenerative therapies has resulted in multiple breakthroughs that may unlock the optic nerve's regenerative potential. Increasing levels of Schwann-cell derived trophic factors and reducing potent cell-intrinsic suppressors of regeneration have resulted in axonal regeneration even beyond the optic chiasm. Despite this success, many challenges remain. RGC axons must be able to form new connections with their appropriate targets in central brain regions and these connections must be retinotopically correct. Furthermore, for new axons penetrating the optic projection, oligodendrocyte glia must provide myelination. Additionally, reactive gliosis and inflammation that increase the regenerative capacity must be outweigh pro-apoptotic processes to create an environment within which maximal regeneration can occur."

Systematic Analysis of Splice-Site-Creating Mutations in Cancer,"Reyka G. Jayasinghe, Song Cao, Qingsong Gao, Michael C. Wendl, Li Ding, ","Cell Reports, Volume 23, Issue 1, 3 April 2018, Pages 270-281.e3, ","For the past decade, cancer genomic studies have focused on mutations leading to splice-site disruption, overlooking those having splice-creating potential. Here, we applied a bioinformatic tool, MiSplice, for the large-scale discovery of splice-site-creating mutations (SCMs) across 8,656 TCGA tumors. We report 1,964 originally mis-annotated mutations having clear evidence of creating alternative splice junctions. TP53 and GATA3 have 26 and 18 SCMs, respectively, and ATRX has 5 from lower-grade gliomas. Mutations in 11 genes, including PARP1, BRCA1, and BAP1, were experimentally validated for splice-site-creating function. Notably, we found that neoantigens induced by SCMs are likely several folds more immunogenic compared to missense mutations, exemplified by the recurrent GATA3 SCM. Further, high expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was observed in tumors with SCMs, suggesting candidates for immune blockade therapy. Our work highlights the importance of integrating DNA and RNA data for understanding the functional and the clinical implications of mutations in human diseases.Download high-res image (216KB)Download full-size image"

A total of 21,672 middle and high school students were surveyed in seven cities of Guangdong Province. Self-reported NMUPM and information regarding family and school factors were collected. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were used to explore potentially influential factors.Of the total sample, the mean age was 16 (㊣1.9) years. Approximately 6.0% of respondents reported lifetime NMUPM. The most common nonmedically used prescription drug among NMUPM users was scattered analgesics, at approximately 3.9%, followed by cough medicine with codeine (2.1%). Multilevel logistic regression analysis indicated that living arrangements, available money, social friends, and smoking were significantly correlated with NMUPM among boys and girls. Academic achievement and family relationships were only significantly correlated with NMUPM among girls, and communication with parents was only associated with NMUPM among boys.These results indicate that NMUPM represented a considerable problem for particular subgroups of adolescents. A well-established surveillance system and target intervention programs are needed given the potential long-term negative outcomes of NMUPM."
In vivo NIRF and MR dual-modality imaging using glycol chitosan nanoparticles,"Jaehong Key, Christy Cooper, Ah Young Kim, Deepika Dhawan, James F. Leary, ","Journal of Controlled Release, Volume 163, Issue 2, 28 October 2012, Pages 249-255, ","One difficulty of diagnosing and treating cancer is that it is very challenging to detect cancers in the early stages before metastasis occurs. A variety of imaging modalities needs to be used from non-invasive, moderate resolution modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to very high-resolution (e.g. fluorescence) imaging that can help guide surgeons during a surgical operation. While MRI can have relatively high resolution and deep penetration to visualize soft tissues, low sensitivity of MRI frequently requires tumor imaging agents to enhance the MRI contrast at the tumor site. At the other end of the resolution spectrum, near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging has very high sensitivity but frequently cannot be utilized for initial human in vivo imaging due to its very limited penetration depth. To combine the advantages of each imaging modality we have constructed MRI and NIRF dual-modality nanoparticles using glycol chitosan, Cy5.5, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs). We have demonstrated these advantages for dual-modality, in vivo tumor imaging in mice. Our studies suggest the potential use of NIRF and MR dual modality imaging for human cancer diagnosis.We report superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPIO) loaded glycol chitosan nanoparticles for in vivo NIRF and MR tumor targeting.Download high-res image (95KB)Download full-size image"
Crystallinity of hydroxyapatite drives myofibroblastic activation and calcification in aortic valves,"Jennifer M. Richards, Jennie A. M. R. Kunitake, Heather B. Hunt, Alexa N. Wnorowski, Jonathan T. Butcher, ","Acta Biomaterialia, Volume 71, 15 April 2018, Pages 24-36, ","Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is an inexorably degenerative pathology characterized by progressive calcific lesion formation on the valve leaflets. The interaction of valvular cells in advanced lesion environments is not well understood yet highly relevant as clinically detectable CAVD exhibits calcifications composed of non-stoichiometric hydroxyapatite (HA). In this study, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging was used to spatially analyze mineral properties as a function of disease progression. Crystallinity (size and perfection) increased with increased valve calcification. To study the relationship between crystallinity and cellular behavior in CAVD, valve cells were seeded into 3D mineral-rich collagen gels containing synthetic HA particles, which had varying crystallinities. Lower crystallinity HA drove myofibroblastic activation in both valve interstitial and endothelial cells, as well as osteoblastic differentiation in interstitial cells. Additionally, calcium accumulation within gels depended on crystallinity, and apoptosis was insufficient to explain differences in HA-driven cellular activity. The protective nature of endothelial cells against interstitial cell activation and calcium accumulation was completely inhibited in the presence of less crystalline HA particles. Elucidating valve cellular behavior post-calcification is of vital importance to better predict and treat clinical pathogenesis, and mineral-containing hydrogel models provide a unique 3D platform to evaluate valve cell responses to a later stage of valve disease.We implement a 3D in vitro platform with embedded hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles to investigate the interaction between valve interstitial cells, valve endothelial cells, and a mineral-rich extracellular environment. HA nanoparticles were synthesized based on analysis of the mineral properties of calcific regions of diseased human aortic valves. Our findings indicate that crystallinity of HA drives activation and differentiation in interstitial and endothelial cells. We also show that a mineralized environment blocks endothelial protection against interstitial cell calcification. Our HA-containing hydrogel model provides a unique 3D platform to evaluate valve cell responses to a mineralized ECM. This study additionally lays the groundwork to capture the diversity of mineral properties in calcified valves, and link these properties to progression of the disease.Download high-res image (386KB)Download full-size image"
Evaluation on the interval values of tolerance fit for the composite bolted joint,"Chao Chen, Dean Hu, Qiming Liu, Xu Han, ","Composite Structures, Volume 206, 15 December 2018, Pages 628-636, ","The bolted joint has frequently been used to join different components together for the composite materials. However, the effect of tolerance fit on mechanical properties of the composite bolted joint is still ambiguous. In this paper, a three-dimensional numerical model is established and validated by reference experiment for the single-lap composite bolted joint. Then the High Dimension Model Representation (HDMR) using Sobol method is employed to analyse the global sensitivity of tolerance fit, bolt clamping force and friction of contact interfaces. The sensitivity index indicates that the tolerance of composite hole is the most crucial parameter for the mechanical properties of composite bolted joint. Finally, the interval values of tolerance behaviours between bolt shank and laminate hole are investigated numerically based on Six Sigma analysis. The tolerance is analysed by considering the influences of perfect fit, clearance fit and interference fit on mechanical properties. This work provides a meaningful reference for selecting the tolerance fit for the composite bolted joint."
Training the fuzzy integral,"James M. Keller, Jeffrey Osborn, ","International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, Volume 15, Issue 1, July 1996, Pages 1-24, ","The value of the fuzzy integral in a decision making environment where uncertainty is present has been well established. The fusion of multiple information sources is very valuable in overcoming the inherent ambiguities present in single information sources and in resolving conflicting information from separate decisions. However, using the fuzzy integral to overcome such uncertainties introduces an uncertainty of its won, specifically that of generating the importance of each subset of the information sources in determining an unambiguous solution. In this paper, a neuron model for using the fuzzy integral in a multiclass decision making environment us presented. A method of training the fuzzy density values from labeled data is developed. This training algorithm uses a reward and punishment scheme in order to increase the reliability of the decision making process. The result of this training is a set of fuzzy density values which represents the importance of each source with respect to the decision. One important feature of this method is that the fuzzy density values for all classes are considered at each iteration, resulting in more comparable values for the fuzzy integrals, a troublesome problem with many independent training algorithms. The training algorithm is demonstrated with synthetic data and in an automatic target recognition application."

We have explored the feasibility of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique when condensation alone occurs, and when both condensation and coagulation occur simultaneously.

The effect of plaster composition and binder concentration on strain mismatch and deformation of slip-cast green bodies,"John D Yates, Stephen J Lombardo, ","Materials Science and Engineering: A, Volume 337, Issues 1每2, 25 November 2002, Pages 297-305, ","High-aspect ratio beams of alumina were slip cast at 30每50 vol.% solids with a level of poly(acrylic) acid corresponding to the minimum in viscosity. The beams, which were sintered in an unconstrained manner, deform into the shape of an arc at elevated temperature. The curvature of the beams was seen to increase with increasing solids loading and to depend on measures related to the particle velocity during casting. When an acrylic binder was added to the slurry, the degree of curvature was seen to increase as compared to when no binder was present. The composition of the plaster molds was seen to have a negligible effect on the magnitude of the bending. A model based upon strain mismatch indicates that a 3% variation in the green density within the beams would account for the observed amount of curvature."
Compost-bulking agents reduce the reservoir of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in manures by modifying bacterial microbiota,"Jin Zhang, Hui Lin, Junwei Ma, Wanchun Sun, Xin Zhang, ","Science of The Total Environment, Volume 649, 1 February 2019, Pages 396-404, ","Sawdust, rice husk, and mushroom residues are commonly used as bulking agents during manure composting; this work evaluated their potentiality for enhancing the removal of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) under a temperature-consistent condition. Results indicated that the addition of all the compost-bulking agents increased antibiotic removal in swine manure with increasing rates of 14.9%每33.4%; however they showed less effect on the reduction of residual antibiotics in chicken manure where fluoroquinolone (FQs) antibiotics are the dominant antibiotics, partly owing to the weak promoting effects of bulking agents on FQs degradation. The addition of bulking agents somehow hindered the reduction of ARGs within swine manure, whereas there were obvious reductions in the total relative abundance of ARGs in chicken manure with bulking agents added. Among the three bulking agents, sawdust was the most efficient enhancer for antibiotic removal in both manures, and rice husk exhibited the best performance on ARGs reduction in chicken manure. The relationship between antibiotics, ARGs and bacteria communities was subsequently delineated. Proteobacteria was proposed to play key roles on the effect of bulking agent addition on antibiotics and ARGs in swine manure. Particularly, the increased Xanthomonadaceae contributed much to the promoted antibiotic degradation as well as the high level of ARGs in swine manure with sawdust added. By contrast, the changes in dominant bacterial families by the addition of bulking agents into chicken manure were not strong enough to effectively enhance antibiotic removal, but largely influenced the ARGs abundance. The large reductions of Paenibacillaceae and Staphylococcaceae by rice husk addition were closely related to the reduced ARGs in chicken manure with rice husk added.Download high-res image (334KB)Download full-size image"
Sensitivity of EEG in young rats to toluene exposure,"Tushar K. Ghosh, Robert L. Copeland, S. N.

Rats were exposed to one of the three concentrations [low (108每111 ppm), medium (160每163 ppm), and high (407每432 ppm)] of toluene on different days. In tests on sleep-wake cycle, in the young animals the duration of the wake stage (W) was increased with decreases of rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep during hr 1 and hr 2 of exposure to the low concentration. These effects were marked at the medium and the high concentrations. In adult rats, at the low concentration the increase of W and the decrease of REM were observed only at hr 1; however, at medium and high concentrations those changes of W and REM sleep were marked along with a decrease of NREM. Comparison of the changes of duration of different states in rats of two age groups showed that there was a significant difference in the increase of W and the decrease of NREM sleep in young rats at hr 2 of exposure to low concentrations only compared to those in adult rats. Tested on power spectrum in young rats during REM sleep recorded from the visual cortex, the power of 汛 waves increased at the medium and high concentrations and that of 牟 wave decreased at the high concentration during hr 2 of exposure compared to the controls. In adult animals the power of 牟 wave recorded from the visual cortex during REM sleep was also decreased at hr 2 of exposure to the concentration. In both groups no significant change in power spectrum was observed during W and NREM sleep. However, from the effects on sleep-wake cycle at low concentration the young rats appear to be more sensitive to toluene exposure compared to adult rats."
Antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in global lakes: A review and meta-analysis,"Yuyi Yang, Wenjuan Song, Hui Lin, Weibo Wang, Wei Xing, ","Environment International, Volume 116, July 2018, Pages 60-73, ","Lakes are an important source of freshwater, containing nearly 90% of the liquid surface fresh water worldwide. Long retention times in lakes mean pollutants from discharges slowly circulate around the lakes and may lead to high ecological risk for ecosystem and human health. In recent decades, antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been regarded as emerging pollutants. The occurrence and distribution of antibiotics and ARGs in global freshwater lakes are summarized to show the pollution level of antibiotics and ARGs and to identify some of the potential risks to ecosystem and human health. Fifty-seven antibiotics were reported at least once in the studied lakes. Our meta-analysis shows that sulfamethoxazole, sulfamerazine, sulfameter, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, and roxithromycin were found at high concentrations in both lake water and lake sediment. There is no significant difference in the concentration of sulfonamides in lake water from China and that from other countries worldwide; however, there was a significant difference in quinolones. Erythromycin had the lowest predicted hazardous concentration for 5% of the species (HC5) and the highest ecological risk in lakes. There was no significant difference in the concentration of sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1 and sul2) in lake water and river water. There is surprisingly limited research on the role of aquatic biota in propagation of ARGs in freshwater lakes. As an environment that is susceptible to cumulative build-up of pollutants, lakes provide an important environment to study the fate of antibiotics and transport of ARGs with a broad range of niches including bacterial community, aquatic plants and animals.Download high-res image (294KB)Download full-size image"
Pan-Cancer Analysis of lncRNA Regulation Supports Their Targeting of Cancer Genes in Each Tumor Context,"Hua-Sheng Chiu, Sonal Somvanshi, Ektaben Patel, Ting-Wen Chen, Pavel Sumazin, ","Cell Reports, Volume 23, Issue 1, 3 April 2018, Pages 297-312.e12, ","Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are commonly dysregulated in tumors, but only a handful are known to play pathophysiological roles in cancer. We inferred lncRNAs that dysregulate cancer pathways, oncogenes, and tumor suppressors (cancer genes) by modeling their effects on the activity of transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and microRNAs in 5,185 TCGA tumors and 1,019 ENCODE assays. Our predictions included hundreds of candidate onco- and tumor-suppressor lncRNAs (cancer lncRNAs) whose somatic alterations account for the dysregulation of dozens of cancer genes and pathways in each of 14 tumor contexts. To demonstrate proof of concept, we showed that perturbations targeting OIP5-AS1 (an inferred tumor suppressor) and TUG1 and WT1-AS (inferred onco-lncRNAs) dysregulated cancer genes and altered proliferation of breast and gynecologic cancer cells. Our analysis indicates that, although most lncRNAs are dysregulated in a tumor-specific manner, some, including OIP5-AS1, TUG1, NEAT1, MEG3, and TSIX, synergistically dysregulate cancer pathways in multiple tumor contexts.Download high-res image (324KB)Download full-size image"

Here, using multidimensional omic data of 9,125 tumor samples across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we perform comprehensive molecular characterization of 929 ubiquitin-related genes and 95 deubiquitinase genes. Among them, we systematically identify top somatic driver candidates, including mutated FBXW7 with cancer-type-specific patterns and amplified MDM2 showing a mutually exclusive pattern with BRAF mutations. Ubiquitin pathway genes tend to be upregulated in cancer mediated by diverse mechanisms. By integrating pan-cancer multiomic data, we identify a group of tumor samples that exhibit worse prognosis. These samples are consistently associated with the upregulation of cell-cycle and DNA repair pathways, characterized by mutated TP53, MYC/TERT amplification, and APC/PTEN deletion.

Time-discontinuous material point method for transient problems,"Mengkai Lu, Jiayong Zhang, Hongwu Zhang, Yonggang Zheng, Zhen Chen, ","Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Volume 328, 1 January 2018, Pages 663-685, ","This paper presents a time-discontinuous material point method (TDMPM) for transient problems such as the wave propagation and impact responses in solids. By dividing the continuous time domain into discrete time intervals, the weak form of the TDMPM is established by considering the discrete grid-based governing equations, constraint and discontinuity conditions. The displacement and velocity fields in a time interval are interpolated with the piecewise cubic and linear functions, respectively. By substituting the assumed displacement and velocity fields into the weak form, a novel computational framework for the grid displacements and velocities at the discrete time instants is constructed. In the new formulations, the displacement field at each time instant remains to be continuous, whereas the velocity field at the time instant becomes discontinuous. These unique features ensure the TDMPM could properly capture the discontinuous characteristics and control the spurious numerical oscillations. Two numerical examples under the impact loading are used to verify the proposed method. Two representative impact problems are then presented for further verification and demonstration. Besides, the corresponding contact algorithm adopted in the TDMPM is shown to be capable of capturing the correct contact behavior with higher fidelity and less computational cost than the MPM. The presented results illustrate that the TDMPM could successfully control the spurious numerical oscillations associated with transient simulations."

A predictive model for the size dependent thermal conductivity is proposed and agrees well with the results of molecular dynamics simulation for silicon nanofilms. The ballistic transport has different effects on the heat conduction in the in-plane or cross-plane directions, which causes the anisotropy of thermal conductivity of nanofilms.

David, ","Journal of Endodontics, Volume 25, Issue 5, May 1999, Pages 324-328, ","Isolates previously thought to be Prevotella intermedia have been shown to be a closely related species now known as Prevotella nigrescens. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to differentiate endodontic isolates of P. nigrescens from P. intermedia. Fifty-six strains of black-pigmented bacteria isolated from endodontic infections and conventionally identified as P. intermedia were used in this study. Using SDS-PAGE, novel polypeptide bands were used to differentiate P. nigrescens from P. intermedia. PCR was accomplished with specific primers for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of both strains. Of 56 endodontic isolates, 41 (73%) strains were identified by SDS-PAGE as P. nigrescens and 15 (27%) strains as P. intermedia. Of the 41 strains of P. nigrescens identified by SDS-PAGE, PCR identified 37 strains as P. nigrescens. Restriction endonuclease digestion of amplified 16S ribosomal RNA genes indicated that the remaining four strains originally identified by SDS-PAGE as P. nigrescens were actually strains of Prevotella distinct from P. nigrescens and P. intermedia. Of 15 strains of P. intermedia identified by SDS-PAGE, PCR identified 14 strains as P. intermedia; but, one strain was identified as P. nigrescens. The results indicated that PCR was a more precise method than SDS-PAGE to differentiate P. intermedia from P. nigrescens. This study confirms that P. nigrescens is more commonly isolated in pure culture from endodontic infections than P. intermedia."
Body mass index status is effective in identifying metabolic syndrome components and insulin resistance in Pacific Island teenagers living in New Zealand,"Andrea M. Grant, Finau K. Taungapeau, Kirsten A. McAuley, Rachael W. Taylor, Ailsa Goulding, ","Metabolism, Volume 57, Issue 4, April 2008, Pages 511-516, ","Although adults of Pacific ethnicity living in New Zealand have more than double the prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease than the general population, little is known regarding the presence of risk factors for these disorders among young Pacific Islanders. The study aim was to examine relationships between body composition, glucose and lipid metabolism, and components of the metabolic syndrome (MS) in a community sample of Pacific Island (PI) teenagers living in Dunedin. Anthropometry, body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment [HOMA2], McAuley index), and components of MS were assessed in 80 PI teenagers (aged 15-18 years). Results showed that 6 participants had full MS, 2 had high fasting blood glucose values (>7.0 mmol/L), 55 had high adiposity, and 21 had insulin resistance. Assessment of the components of MS by body mass index (BMI) status showed that obese participants (n = 29) had a high prevalence (86.2% had one or more component), whereas only 10.5% of those with healthy BMI status (n = 19) had any MS component. Elevated fat mass had substantial effects on fasting insulin values, HOMA2, and the McAuley index because in data adjusted for age, sex, and lean mass, a 10% greater fat mass was associated with a 4.7% increase in fasting insulin, a 5.3% rise in HOMA2, and a 2.3% decrease in the McAuley index. Our results suggest that the antecedents of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus occur frequently in young Pacific Islanders having high adiposity. We conclude that community studies of PI adolescents should focus on assessing risk factors whenever BMI values are high."

Arthroscopy of the shoulder in the management of partial tears of the rotator cuff: A preliminary report,"James R. Andrews, Thad S. Broussard, William G. Carson, ","Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic & Related Surgery, Volume 1, Issue 2, 1985, Pages 117-122, ","Thirty-six patients with partial tears of the supraspinatus portion of the rotator cuff underwent arthroscopic examination and debridement of the lesion. All patients, whose average age was 22 years, were involved in competitive athletics; 64% were baseball pitchers. The average duration of symptoms prior to arthroscopy was 12 months. The most common presenting complaint was pain felt in the shoulder during overhead activities. Associated pathology included tears of the glenoid labrum and partial tearing or tendinitis of the long head of the biceps tendon. Of the 34 patients available for followup, 26 (76%) had excellent results, three (9%) had good results, and five (15%) had poor results. Eighty-five percent of the patients returned satisfactorily to their preoperative athletic activity. Our preliminary experience with arthroscopy of the shoulder in the management of patients with partial rotator cuff tears is encouraging. Not only can a partial rotator cuff tear be debrided to initiate a healing response, but a definitive diagnosis can also be made and associated pathology identified, permitting the establishment of an appropriate rehabilitation program."
A novel prediction method for gear friction coefficients based on a computational inverse technique,"Changjiang Zhou, Bo Hu, Xuanlv Qian, Xu Han, ","Tribology International, Volume 127, November 2018, Pages 200-208, ","A novel prediction method for gear friction coefficients with or without lubrication is developed with a computational inverse technique. A surrogate model is introduced to describe the mapping between the friction coefficients and root stresses, according to an adaptive radial basis function. The convergence criterion for solving the friction coefficients is determined based on the calculated and measured root stresses. A nonzero friction coefficient at the pitch point, which is closely relative to the action of rolling friction, is detected using the proposed method. Results show that the gear friction coefficients decrease with an increase in rotation speed or a decline in applied torque. Moreover, the friction coefficients without lubrication are more than twice those with lubrication."
Human-based spatial relationship generalization through neural/fuzzy approaches," Xiaomei Wang, James M. Keller, ","Fuzzy Sets and Systems, Volume 101, Issue 1, 1 January 1999, Pages 5-20, ","Spatial relationships exhibited among regions in an image play an important role in the interpretation of a scene. While humans have an innate ability to recognize spatial relations, it has been difficult to produce algorithms to model these relationships. There have been several attempts to define spatial relationships between objects in a digital image, most recently, with the use of fuzzy set theory. Unfortunately, no method can work effectively in all cases. In this paper, we introduce neural network structures combined with the Choquet fuzzy integration to generalize spatial relationship membership functions. To match the spatial relationship membership value with human intuition, we tested people's perceptions of spatial relations and applied the human test results as the desired outputs of neural networks. Finally, some experimental results on synthetic and real images are shown."
A Fuzzy Rule-Based Approach to Scene Description Involving Spatial Relationships,"James M.

Today, scene description is being applied in real problems such as robotic navigation. In this paper, we present a fuzzy rule-based approach that accomplishes the task of automated linguistic scene description. Membership functions for spatial relations between different components in the scene are evaluated, guided by a spatial relationship matrix that describes typical scene entities for which these relative locations are desirable. A fuzzy logic rule-based system is developed to combine the spatial relationships and other important scene properties to generate the final linguistic interpretation. Excellent results from several image examples of different types show the applicability of this approach."
Chx10 Consolidates V2a Interneuron Identity through Two Distinct Gene Repression Modes,"Yoanne M. Clovis, So Yeon Seo, Ji-sun Kwon, Jennifer C. Rhee, Soo-Kyung Lee, ","Cell Reports, Volume 16, Issue 6, 9 August 2016, Pages 1642-1652, ","During development, two cell types born from closely related progenitor pools often express identical transcriptional regulators despite their completely distinct characteristics. This phenomenon implies the need for a mechanism that operates to segregate the identities of the two cell types throughout differentiation after initial fate commitment. To understand this mechanism, we investigated the fate specification of spinal V2a interneurons, which share important developmental genes with motor neurons (MNs). We demonstrate that the paired homeodomain factor Chx10 functions as a critical determinant for V2a fate and is required to consolidate V2a identity in postmitotic neurons. Chx10 actively promotes V2a fate, downstream of the LIM-homeodomain factor Lhx3, while concomitantly suppressing the MN developmental program by preventing the MN-specific transcription complex from binding and activating MN genes. This dual activity enables Chx10 to effectively separate the V2a and MN pathways. Our study uncovers a widely applicable gene regulatory principle for segregating related cell fates.Download high-res image (250KB)Download full-size image"
Use of three-dimensional computed tomography for the analysis of the glenoid anatomy,"Young W. Kwon, Kimerly A. Powell, Jae Kwang Yum, John J. Brems, Joseph P. Iannotti, ","Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery, Volume 14, Issue 1, January每February 2005, Pages 85-90, ","Preoperative evaluation for a total shoulder arthroplasty includes 2-dimensional analysis of the glenoid through either standard radiographs or computed tomography (CT) images. Recent evidence suggests that these 2-dimensional images may actually misrepresent the 3-dimensional (3D) anatomy of the glenoid. Because 3D reconstructions of CT images allow 3D visualization and analysis of the scapula as a free body, we hypothesized that they can reflect the true anatomy of the glenoid more accurately. To test this hypothesis, we obtained various glenoid morphometric measurements from excised cadaveric scapulae as well as their respective 3D CT images. On average, the glenoid version angles measured from the 3D CT images were within 1.0∼ ㊣ 0.7∼ (mean ㊣ SD) of those from the actual specimen (95% confidence limit, <2.2∼ for all observers). These measurements from the 3D CT images showed high interobserver and intraobserver reliability (interobserver and intraobserver correlation coefficients, 0.983 and 0.978, respectively). Similarly, measured glenoid surface width and length from the 3D CT images were within 1.8 ㊣ 1.2 mm and 1.4 ㊣ 1.1 mm, respectively, of those from the actual specimen. In addition, we were able to estimate the glenoid surface area as well as the glenoid vault volume from the 3D CT images. These values were 8.67 ㊣ 2.73 cm2 and 11.86 ㊣ 5.06 cm3, respectively. The mean glenoid vault volume with respect to its surface area was 1.35 ㊣ 0.24 cm3/cm2 (range, 1.06每1.91 cm3/cm2). These data suggest that 3D CT images can accurately reflect the true anatomy of the glenoid and that they can provide valuable information regarding the glenoid surface and vault. As such, 3D CT images may prove to be a useful tool during the preoperative evaluation for a total shoulder arthroplasty, particularly in patients with significant glenoid bone loss."

To improve the protective efficacy of M2e vaccines, we genetically engineered a tandem repeat of M2e epitope sequences (M2e5x) of human, swine, and avian origin influenza A viruses, which was expressed in a membrane-anchored form and incorporated in virus-like particles (VLPs). The M2e5x protein with the transmembrane domain of hemagglutinin (HA) was effectively incorporated into VLPs at a several 100-fold higher level than that on influenza virions. Intramuscular immunization with M2e5x VLP vaccines was highly effective in inducing M2e-specific antibodies reactive to different influenza viruses, mucosal and systemic immune responses, and cross-protection regardless of influenza virus subtypes in the absence of adjuvant. Importantly, immune sera were found to be sufficient for conferring protection in naive mice, which was long-lived and cross-protective. Thus, molecular designing and presenting M2e immunogens on VLPs provide a promising platform for developing universal influenza vaccines without using adjuvants."

Effect of fatigue loading and residual stress on microscopic deformation mechanisms in a spot welded joint,"Xin Long, Sanjeev K. Khanna, Lawrence F.

The relationship between microstructure evolution and residual stress during fatigue loading has been considered. It has been found that under high fatigue load, dislocation density in spot nugget edge is much higher than that in nugget center area, which indicates significant plastic deformation occurred at the edge of spot nugget during fatigue testing. Under low fatigue load, dislocation density is quite low in both the edge and center area of spot nugget. The effect of post-heating is that more dislocations could be generated during fatigue testing for both high and low loading conditions. Post-heating results in lower strength of spot welded joint while it releases the residual stress in it, which reduces the fatigue life of the spot welded sheet."

Probabilistic analysis and resistance factor calibration for deep foundation design using Monte Carlo simulation,"Thuy Vu, Erik Loehr, Douglas Smith, ","Heliyon, Volume 4, Issue 8, August 2018, Article e00727, ","The method of incorporating the sources of parameter uncertainty is crucial when conducting probabilistic analysis for service limit state (SLS) design of a deep foundation. This paper describes the method of using Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic analyses and for calibration of resistance factors of drilled shafts at SLS. The paper presents discussions on the finding of an impossible case, where the different combinations of load, variability of soil strength and target probability of failure made it impossible to calibrate the SLS resistance factors. Resistance factors for drilled shafts in shale are introduced, and were found to be responsive to load levels. The higher load level, the lower the resistance factor. These findings help smooth the transition from allowable stress design to load and resistance factor design for geotechnical engineers."

Communication is monitored with respect to the number of utterances, number of words per utterance, and the durations of each utterance. Several structural equation models are considered to examine the direct and indirect effects of individual extraversion on team performance. Notably, the degree of extraversion did not directly affect team performance. However, there are several models that indicate significant relationships between extraversion and team performance with communications as mediators. The current results contribute to the literature by adding to our understanding of the mediating variables that exist within the personality每performance team dynamic.Industry can use this research to better inform managers on metrics for team formation. This has the potential to improve the performance of teams and groups of teams. Our results reinforce the need for certain forms of communication to foster high performing team behavior."

The tests showed that the 汎 potential of the biomass changes with water-contact time, concentration, temperature, additives, etc. It was found that adding polyethylene oxide (Polyox) decreases the 汎 potential of biomass and improves the strength of compacted biomass logs. Therefore, monitoring and controlling the 汎 potential of biomass mixture may be helpful to compact stronger biomass logs without using binder."

The statistical data of modeled foam structures, including distribution of the cell volume, face and edge number is very close to the characteristics of real materials. The results also show that a higher coefficient of variation in the sphere diameter would decrease the average number of faces per cell. The average number of faces varies from 13.56 to 14.43 for different coefficients of variation of sphere diameter, while the average number of faces in the Poisson-Voronoi tessellation structures is approximately 15.5.

Combined use of sewage sludge ash and recycled glass cullet for the production of concrete blocks,"Zhen Chen, Jiang Shan Li, Chi Sun Poon, ","Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 171, 10 January 2018, Pages 1447-1459, ","Concrete paving blocks are widely used in many parts of the world because of their flexibility in construction and low maintenance costs. New generations of the blocks have already incorporated some types of wastes for achieving waste recycling. Sewage sludge ash (SSA) produced from the incineration of dewatered sewage sludge may be used to partially replace cement for construction. This study investigated the properties of concrete blocks using SSA as a cement replacement together with recycled construction and demolition aggregates or glass cullet (GC) as a partial substitution of natural aggregates for producing concrete blocks by the dry mix (zero slump) compression method. No research in published literature has been conducted on the complementary effects from the utilization of SSA as a cement substitute and some recycled materials as aggregates in producing concrete blocks. Assessments of technical benefits and leaching risks were made with a view to encouraging recycling of waste materials and enhancing conservation of natural resources. The research findings revealed that the SSA possessed moderate pozzolanic activity and it increased the long term compressive strength of the blocks. More importantly, it was found that combining the use of SSA with GC is superior to using the ash alone for block making due to significant reduction in drying shrinkage. On the other hand, the alkali-silica reaction caused by the reactive GC could in turn be suppressed with the incorporation of the SSA. Leaching tests conducted also showed compliance with the regulatory limits. These results indicate that the combined use of SSA and GC can produce paving blocks with satisfactory mechanical, durability and leaching properties while helping the recycling of the two types of solid wastes."

Amplicons were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, with an 815 bp amplicon representing the presence of the collagenase gene. Type strain ATCC 33277 and all 16 clinical isolates of P. gingivalis produced the collagenase gene amplicon. Neither type strain ATCC 35406 nor the five strains from clinical isolates of P. endodontalis produced the collagenase gene amplicon. These results indicate that P. gingivalis from endodontic infections possesses the prtC gene. P. endodontalis does not seem to exhibit prtC. The virulence of P. gingivalis may be related to its production of collagenase."
Children who avoid drinking cow＊s milk are at increased risk for prepubertal bone fractures,"Ailsa Goulding, Jennifer E. P. Rockell, Ruth E. Black, Andrea M. Grant, Sheila M. Williams, ","Journal of the American Dietetic Association, Volume 104, Issue 2, February 2004, Pages 250-253, ","The full fracture histories of 50 children (30 girls and 20 boys, age range 3 to 13 years) who had avoided drinking cow＊s milk for prolonged periods were compared with those in a birth cohort of more than 1,000 children from the same city. Children who avoided milk did not use calcium-rich food substitutes appropriately and had low dietary calcium intakes and low bone mineral density values. Many were overweight (22 of 50). Significantly more of the children who avoided milk reported fractures (16 observed vs 6 expected, 聿2=31.0, P<.001, df=5). They also experienced more total fractures than the birth cohort population (22 observed vs 8 expected, 聿2=33.6, P<.001, df=5). All of the fractures occurred before puberty, the majority (18 of 22) being associated with only slight trauma. Forearm fractures were especially common (12 fractures). We conclude that young children avoiding milk are prone to fracture."

Measuring performance on the Healthcare Access and Quality Index for 195 countries and territories and selected subnational locations: a systematic analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016,"GBD 2016 Healthcare Access and Quality Collaborators, ","The Lancet, Volume 391, Issue 10136, 2每8 June 2018, Pages 2236-2271, ","A key component of achieving universal health coverage is ensuring that all populations have access to quality health care. Examining where gains have occurred or progress has faltered across and within countries is crucial to guiding decisions and strategies for future improvement. We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) to assess personal health-care access and quality with the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index for 195 countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in seven countries, from 1990 to 2016.Drawing from established methods and updated estimates from GBD 2016, we used 32 causes from which death should not occur in the presence of effective care to approximate personal health-care access and quality by location and over time. To better isolate potential effects of personal health-care access and quality from underlying risk factor patterns, we risk-standardised cause-specific deaths due to non-cancers by location-year, replacing the local joint exposure of environmental and behavioural risks with the global level of exposure. Supported by the expansion of cancer registry data in GBD 2016, we used mortality-to-incidence ratios for cancers instead of risk-standardised death rates to provide a stronger signal of the effects of personal health care and access on cancer survival. We transformed each cause to a scale of 0每100, with 0 as the first percentile (worst) observed between 1990 and 2016, and 100 as the 99th percentile (best); we set these thresholds at the country level, and then applied them to subnational locations. We applied a principal components analysis to construct the HAQ Index using all scaled cause values, providing an overall score of 0每100 of personal health-care access and quality by location over time. We then compared HAQ Index levels and trends by quintiles on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary measure of overall development. As derived from the broader GBD study and other data sources, we examined relationships between national HAQ Index scores and potential correlates of performance, such as total health spending per capita.In 2016, HAQ Index performance spanned from a high of 97﹞1 (95% UI 95﹞8每98﹞1) in Iceland, followed by 96﹞6 (94﹞9每97﹞9) in Norway and 96﹞1 (94﹞5每97﹞3) in the Netherlands, to values as low as 18﹞6 (13﹞1每24﹞4) in the Central African Republic, 19﹞0 (14﹞3每23﹞7) in Somalia, and 23﹞4 (20﹞2每26﹞8) in Guinea-Bissau. The pace of progress achieved between 1990 and 2016 varied, with markedly faster improvements occurring between 2000 and 2016 for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, whereas several countries in Latin America and elsewhere saw progress stagnate after experiencing considerable advances in the HAQ Index between 1990 and 2000. Striking subnational disparities emerged in personal health-care access and quality, with China and India having particularly large gaps between locations with the highest and lowest scores in 2016. In China, performance ranged from 91﹞5 (89﹞1每93﹞6) in Beijing to 48﹞0 (43﹞4每53﹞2) in Tibet (a 43﹞5-point difference), while India saw a 30﹞8-point disparity, from 64﹞8 (59﹞6每68﹞8) in Goa to 34﹞0 (30﹞3每38﹞1) in Assam. Japan recorded the smallest range in subnational HAQ performance in 2016 (a 4﹞8-point difference), whereas differences between subnational locations with the highest and lowest HAQ Index values were more than two times as high for the USA and three times as high for England. State-level gaps in the HAQ Index in Mexico somewhat narrowed from 1990 to 2016 (from a 20﹞9-point to 17﹞0-point difference), whereas in Brazil, disparities slightly increased across states during this time (a 17﹞2-point to 20﹞4-point difference). Performance on the HAQ Index showed strong linkages to overall development, with high and high-middle SDI countries generally having higher scores and faster gains for non-communicable diseases. Nonetheless, countries across the development spectrum saw substantial gains in some key health service areas from 2000 to 2016, most notably vaccine-preventable diseases. Overall, national performance on the HAQ Index was positively associated with higher levels of total health spending per capita, as well as health systems inputs, but these relationships were quite heterogeneous, particularly among low-to-middle SDI countries.GBD 2016 provides a more detailed understanding of past success and current challenges in improving personal health-care access and quality worldwide. Despite substantial gains since 2000, many low-SDI and middle-SDI countries face considerable challenges unless heightened policy action and investments focus on advancing access to and quality of health care across key health services, especially non-communicable diseases. Stagnating or minimal improvements experienced by several low-middle to high-middle SDI countries could reflect the complexities of re-orienting both primary and secondary health-care services beyond the more limited foci of the Millennium Development Goals. Alongside initiatives to strengthen public health programmes, the pursuit of universal health coverage hinges upon improving both access and quality worldwide, and thus requires adopting a more comprehensive view〞and subsequent provision〞of quality health care for all populations.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation."
Dissecting the effect of rainfall variability on the statistical structure of peak flows,"Pradeep V. Mandapaka, Witold F. Krajewski, Ricardo Mantilla, Vijay K. Gupta, ","Advances in Water Resources, Volume 32, Issue 10, October 2009, Pages 1508-1525, ","This study examines the role of rainfall variability on the spatial scaling structure of peak flows using the Whitewater River basin in Kansas as an illustration. Specifically, we investigate the effect of rainfall on the scatter, the scale break and the power law (peak flows vs. upstream areas) regression exponent. We illustrate why considering individual hydrographs at the outlet of a basin can lead to misleading interpretations of the effects of rainfall variability. We begin with the simple scenario of a basin receiving spatially uniform rainfall of varying intensities and durations and subsequently investigate the role of storm advection velocity, storm variability characterized by variance, spatial correlation and intermittency. Finally, we use a realistic space每time rainfall field obtained from a popular rainfall model that combines the aforementioned features. For each of these scenarios, we employ a recent formulation of flow velocity for a network of channels, assume idealized conditions of runoff generation and flow dynamics and calculate peak flow scaling exponents, which are then compared to the scaling exponent of the width function maxima. Our results show that the peak flow scaling exponent is always larger than the width function scaling exponent. The simulation scenarios are used to identify the smaller scale basins, whose response is dominated by the rainfall variability and the larger scale basins, which are driven by rainfall volume, river network aggregation and flow dynamics. The rainfall variability has a greater impact on peak flows at smaller scales. The effect of rainfall variability is reduced for larger scale basins as the river network aggregates and smoothes out the storm variability. The results obtained from simple scenarios are used to make rigorous interpretations of the peak flow scaling structure that is obtained from rainfall generated with the space每time rainfall model and realistic rainfall fields derived from NEXRAD radar data."
On scaling exponents of spatial peak flows from rainfall and river network geometry,"Vijay K. Gupta, Sandra L. Castro, Thomas M. Over, ","Journal of Hydrology, Volume 187, Issues 1每2, December 1996, Pages 81-104, ","The hypothesis of statistical self-similarity, or scaling invariance, in the spatial variability of rainfall, channel network structures and floods has been supported by recent advances in data analyses. This hypothesis is used here to calculate the statistical scaling exponents of peak river flows using a random cascade model of spatial rainfall intensities and the Peano basin as an idealized model of a river basin. The ＆maximum contributing set＊ approximately determines the magnitudes of peak flows in a self-similar manner in different subbasins of the Peano basin. For an instantaneously applied random, spatially uniform rainfall, the Hausdorff dimension of the maximum contributing set appear, as the statistical simple scaling exponent of peak flows. This result is generalized to an instantaneously applied cascade rainfall, and it is shown to give rise to statistical multiscaling in peak flows. The multiscaling exponent of peak flows is computed and interpreted as a Hausdorff dimension of a fractal set supporting rainfall intensity on the maximum contributing set of the Peano basin. Potential implications of this interpretation are illustrated using the regional food frequency analysis of the Appalachian flood data in the United States and a rainfall data set from the tropical Atlantic ocean. It is argued that the hypothesis of self-similarity identifies a powerful theoretical framework which can unify a statistical theory of regional flood frequency with important empirical features of topographic, rainfall and flood data sets and distributed rainfall-landform-runoff relationships."
Associations of childhood maltreatment with subsequent illicit drug use among Chinese adolescents: The moderating role of the child's sex,"Lan Guo, Pengsheng Li, Siyuan Pan, Ming Li, Ciyong Lu, ","Psychiatry Research, Volume 269, November 2018, Pages 361-368, ","Adolescence is a critical period for the onset of illicit drug use. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of illicit drug use among Chinese adolescents, to assess the associations between different forms of childhood maltreatment and subsequent illicit drug use and to test whether the child's sex plays a moderating role in the associations. A secondary analysis was made of cross-sectional data collected from 10th to 12th graders from China who were sampled in the 2015 School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey. A total of 59,518 questionnaires were included in the final analysis. The prevalence estimates and logistic regression analyses were weighted to account for the complex survey design. If the interaction term (between childhood maltreatment and sex) was significantly associated with illicit drug use, we would perform stratification analyses across sex. Of the total sample, 45.2% were boys, and the mean (SD) age was 17.0 (0.9) years. The results of stratification analyses demonstrated that among boys, physical abuse and sexual abuse were independently associated with an increased risk of use during their lifetime of MDMA, methamphetamine, ketamine, and mephedrone; among girls, only emotional abuse and sexual abuse were associated with MDMA use, methamphetamine use, ketamine use, and mephedrone use."

There were 24,457 students who were invited to participate and 23,039 students＊ questionnaires were completed and qualified for our survey (response rate: 94.2%).In the adjusted models without mediation, the results showed that students who reported that they had experienced emotional abuse were at a higher risk of past year use and past month use of opioids (past year: Adjusted OR [AOR] = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.05每1.10; past month: AOR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.06每1.10) and sedatives (past year: AOR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03每1.08; past month: AOR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.13每1.16). The results of mediation analyses demonstrated that there were significant standardized indirect effects of emotional abuse on opioids use and sedatives use through depressive symptoms, respectively (P < 0.001).Our study sample only included school students, and causal inference could not be examined due to the cross-sectional design.Depressive symptoms play a significant mediator role on the association of childhood maltreatment with NMUPD. Interventions targeted at adolescents who are involved in NMUPD should pay attention to their histories of childhood maltreatment."
Immobilized algal cells used for hydrogen production,"John J. Hahn, Maria L. Ghirardi, William A. Jacoby, ","Biochemical Engineering Journal, Volume 37, Issue 1, 15 October 2007, Pages 75-79, ","This paper explores the use of the photosynthetic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii bound to solid support particles to produce hydrogen in a two-step cycle. Bound cells are more easily cycled between growth mode and hydrogen production mode. The data indicate that the presence of silica particles does not inhibit the growth of the algae in the sulfur rich growth media. Filtration experiments reveal that the algae effectively bind to the silica particles, as high removal efficiencies are observed. The silica particles appear to approach saturation algae at a mass-loading ratio of about 0.035. In hydrogen production mode, the bound algae perform about as well as free-floating algae in terms of cumulative hydrogen production. A full-factorial experiment is described in which algae concentration was deemed to have a significant effect on cumulative hydrogen production."
A simple model for enamel fracture from margin cracks,"Herzl Chai, James J. -W. Lee, Jae-Young Kwon, Peter W. Lucas, Brian R. Lawn, ","Acta Biomaterialia, Volume 5, Issue 5, June 2009, Pages 1663-1667, ","We present results of in situ fracture tests on extracted human molar teeth showing failure by margin cracking. The teeth are mounted into an epoxy base and loaded with a rod indenter capped with a Teflon insert, as representative of food modulus. In situ observations of cracks extending longitudinally upward from the cervical margins are recorded in real time with a video camera. The cracks appear above some threshold and grow steadily within the enamel coat toward the occlusal surface in a configuration reminiscent of channel-like cracks in brittle films. Substantially higher loading is required to delaminate the enamel from the dentin, attesting to the resilience of the tooth structure. A simplistic fracture mechanics analysis is applied to determine the critical load relation for traversal of the margin crack along the full length of the side wall. The capacity of any given tooth to resist failure by margin cracking is predicted to increase with greater enamel thickness and cuspal radius. Implications in relation to dentistry and evolutionary biology are briefly considered."

An interval inverse method based on high dimensional model representation and affine arithmetic,"Jie Liu, Heng Cai, Chao Jiang, Xu Han, Zheng Zhang, ","Applied Mathematical Modelling, Volume 63, November 2018, Pages 732-743, ","This paper proposes an interval inverse method through a high dimensional model representation and affine arithmetic, which can effectively solve inverse problems with interval uncertainty. Firstly, when only the bounds of responses can be obtained from a limited number of experimental measurements, an interval model can be employed to describe the uncertainty of the measured responses and identified parameters. Secondly, in order to reasonably estimate the degree of the closeness between the measured and calculated responses, an error interval and corresponding optimization model are constructed for the interval inverse problem. Thirdly, a high dimensional model representation is utilized to approximate the original system model, and an affine arithmetic is adopted to efficiently calculate the response bounds. Finally, the optimization model for interval inverse problem is solved using genetic algorithm to identify the upper and lower bounds of the system parameters. Three examples are studied to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method."

Fuzzy shortest paths also have a variety of applications but are hampered by the possibility that the fuzzy shortest length may not correspond to an actual path in the network.

In addition we analyze the fuzzy shortest path algorithms in terms of submodular functions. The analysis concepts developed for fuzzy shortest paths are also discussed in terms of general fuzzy mathematical programming.

The effects of group size and task complexity on deadline reactivity,"Ji-Eun Kim, David A. Nembhard, Jung Hyup Kim, ","International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, Volume 56, November 2016, Pages 106-114, ","In contemporary organizations, people are often required to work and learn under increasing time pressures as organizations set deadlines in order to respond to stiffer competition. Human behavioral patterns in the presence of deadlines have been studied quantitatively to show that relatively little time is devoted to tasks early on and that most work is performed in close time proximity to a deadline. This phenomenon, called deadline rush, can be explained by a hyperbolic behavioral model. By employing a decision-making task based on an Anti-Air Warfare Coordinator (AAWC) simulator, the experiment had two group size levels (individuals and teams) and two task complexity levels (low and high). The experimental results showed that deadline reactivity is greater for individuals than teams on low-complexity tasks and task complexity is negatively related to deadline reactivity. The results of this study suggest that different group sizes and task types have a significant impact on production performance and that the setting of deadlines, to the degree possible, may be a relevant means towards managing or improving system performance."
Structure of Extracellular Polysaccharides (EPS) Produced by Rhizobia and their Functions in Legume每Bacteria Symbiosis: 〞 A Review,"Pallab Kumar Ghosh, Tushar Kanti Maiti, ","Achievements in the Life Sciences, Volume 10, Issue 2, December 2016, Pages 136-143, ","The symbiotic diazotrophs comprise with a very diverse group of Gram negative soil bacteria, collectively called as rhizobia found in nodule of legume plant. Rhizobia adopt themselves in different environment including soil, rhizosphere and grown within legume roots, where they fix nitrogen. The establishment of symbiosis is a very complicated process involving a coordinated exchange of signal between legume plants and the symbionts. The nodule development requires synthesis of signal molecules such as Nod factors that are important for induction of nodule development. There are different types of surface polysaccharides such as lipopolysaccharides, capsular polysaccharides, neutral and acidic polysaccharides found in rhizobia. The production of symbiotically active polysaccharides may allow rhizobial strains to adapt themselves to changing environmental conditions and interact efficiently with legume plants. Despite extensive research, the actual molecular function of the surface polysaccharides of rhizobia in symbiosis remains unclear. This review emphasized on the structural composition of extracellular polysaccharide of different rhizobia isolated from different legume plants. The compositions of extracellular polysaccharides are different in different rhizobia. The various compositions of extracellular polysaccharides produced by the symbionts are considered as the signaling molecules essential for determining host plant specificity. The present status of the biological functions of the exo-polysaccharide in symbiosis such as host specificity, successful invasion, formation of infection thread and induction of nodule formation in legume plants is also summarized here."
Arsenic contamination of drinking water in Ireland: A spatial analysis of occurrence and potential risk,"Ellen R. McGrory, Colin Brown, Norma Bargary, Natalya Hunter Williams, Liam Morrison, ","Science of The Total Environment, Volume 579, 1 February 2017, Pages 1863-1875, ","The presence of arsenic in groundwater has become a global concern due to the health risks from drinking water with elevated concentrations. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Union calls for drinking water risk assessment for member states. The present study amalgamates readily available national and sub-national scale datasets on arsenic in groundwater in the Republic of Ireland. However, due to the presence of high levels of left censoring (i.e. arsenic values below an analytical detection limit) and changes in detection limits over time, the application of conventional statistical methods would inhibit the generation of meaningful results. In order to handle these issues several arsenic databases were integrated and the data modelled using statistical methods appropriate for non-detect data. In addition, geostatistical methods were used to assess principal risk components of elevated arsenic related to lithology, aquifer type and groundwater vulnerability. Geographic statistical methods were used to overcome some of the geographical limitations of the Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sample database. Nearest-neighbour inverse distance weighting (IDW) and local indicator of spatial association (LISA) methods were used to estimate risk in non-sampled areas. Significant differences were also noted between different aquifer lithologies, indicating that Rhyolite, Sandstone and Shale (Greywackes), and Impure Limestone potentially presented a greater risk of elevated arsenic in groundwaters. Significant differences also occurred among aquifer types with poorly productive aquifers, locally important fractured bedrock aquifers and regionally important fissured bedrock aquifers presenting the highest potential risk of elevated arsenic. No significant differences were detected among different groundwater vulnerability groups as defined by the Geological Survey of Ireland. This research will assist management and future policy directions of groundwater resources at EU level and guide future research focused on understanding arsenic mobilisation processes to facilitate in guiding future development, testing and treatment requirements of groundwater resources.Download high-res image (397KB)Download full-size image"

Microhardness was measured to study the hardness change across the weld nugget. Under low load and high cycles situation all the materials show very similar fatigue strength. Crack initiation and propagation during the fatigue loading history has been experimentally determined and discussed. Microhardness tests show that DP600 GI samples have the highest hardness, about 420 HV in weld nugget and 250 HV in base metal, followed by TRIP600-bare, about 400 HV in weld nugget and 220 HV in base metal, and HSLA340Y GI, about 320 HV in weld nugget and 160 HV in base metal. It was also found that both DP600 GI and HSLA340Y GI display softening during high load and low cycles fatigue tests with HSLA showing more prominent softening behavior."

The stochastic Melnikov method is employed and then the criteria in both mean and mean-square sense are derived. The threshold amplitude of bounded noise given by stochastic Melnikov process is in good comparison with one determined by the numerical simulation of top Lyapunov exponents. The presence of noise scatters the chaotic domain in parameter space and the larger noise intensity results in a sparser and more irregular region. Both the simple cell mapping method and the generalized cell mapping method are applied to demonstrate the effects of noises on the attractors. Results show that the attractors are diffused and smeared by bounded noise and if the noise intensity increases, the diffusion is exacerbated."

The most relevant features exploited in applied S-layer research are: (i) pores passing through S-layers show identical size and morphology and are in the range of ultrafiltration membranes; (ii) functional groups on the surface and in the pores are aligned in well-defined positions and orientations and accessible for binding functional molecules in very precise fashion; (iii) isolated S-layer subunits from many organisms are capable of recrystallizing as closed monolayers onto solid supports at the air-water interface, on lipid monolayers or onto the surface of liposomes. Particularly their repetitive physicochemical properties down to the subnanometer scale make S-layers unique structures for functionalization of surfaces and interfaces down to the ultimate resolution limit. The following review focuses on selected applications in biotechnology, diagnostics, vaccine development, biomimetic membranes, supramolecular engineering and nanotechnology. Despite progress in the characterization of S-layers and the exploitation of S-layers for the applications described in this chapter, it is clear that the field lags behind others (e.g. enzyme engineering) in applying recent advances in protein engineering. Genetic modification and targeted chemical modification would allow several possibilities including the manipulation of pore permeation properties, the introduction of switches to open and close the pores, and the covalent attachment to surfaces or other macromolecules through defined sites on the S-layer protein. The application of protein engineering to S-layers will require the development of straightforward expression systems, the development of simple assays for assembly and function that are suitable for the rapid screening of numerous mutants and the acquisition of structural information at atomic resolution. Attention should be given to these areas in the coming years."

Crystallographic study of complexes with coenzyme and substrate explain the NADP dependence which determines the enzyme's metabolic role and support the proposed general base每general acid mechanism.Results The refined structures of binary coenzyme/ analogue complexes show that Arg33 is ordered by binding the 2∩-phosphate, and provides one face of the adenine site. The nicotinamide, while less tightly bound, is more extended when reduced than when oxidized. All substrate binding residues are conserved; the 3-hydroxyl of 6-phosphogluconate is hydrogen bonded to N汎 of Lys183 and the 3-hydrogen points towards the oxidized nicotinamide. The 6-phosphate replaces a tightly bound sulphate in the apo-enzyme.Conclusions NADP specificity is achieved primarily by Arg33 which binds the 2∩-phosphate but, in its absence, obscures the adenine pocket. The bound oxidized nicotinamide is syn ; hydride transfer from bound substrate to the nicotinamide si- face is achieved with a small movement of the nicotinamide nucleotide. Lys183 may act as general base. A water bound to Gly130 in the coenzyme domain is the most likely acid required in decarboxylation. The dihydronicotinamide ring of NADPH competes for ligands with the 1-carboxyl of 6-phosphogluconate."
An adaptive control momentum method as an optimizer in the cloud,"Jianhao Ding, Lansheng Han, Dan Li, ","Future Generation Computer Systems, Volume 89, December 2018, Pages 192-200, ","Many issues in the cloud can be transformed into optimization problems, where data is of high dimension and randomness. Thus, stochastic optimizing is a key to Autonomous Cloud. And one of the most significant discussions in this field is how to adapt the learning rate and convergent path dynamically. This paper proposes a gradient-based algorithm called Adacom, that is based on an adaptive control system and momentum. Critically inheriting the previous studies, a reference model is introduced to generate the update. The method reduces noise and decides on paths with less oscillation, while maintaining the accumulated learning rate. Due to system design properties, the method requires fewer hyper-parameters for tuning. We state the prospect of Adacom as a general optimizer in Autonomous Cloud, and explore the potential of Adacom for pervasive computing by the assumption of transition data. Then we demonstrate the convergence of Adacom theoretically. The evaluations over the simulated transition data prove the feasibility and superiority of Adacom with other gradient-based methods."
Dissociations of the Fluocinolone Acetonide Implant: The Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Trial and Follow-up Study,"Janet T. Holbrook, Elizabeth A. Sugar, Alyce E. Burke, Albert T. Vitale, Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Trial Research Group, ","American Journal of Ophthalmology, Volume 164, April 2016, Pages 29-36, ","To describe fluocinolone acetonide implant dissociations in the Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Trial.Randomized clinical trial with extended follow-up.Review of data collected on the first implant in the eye(s) of participants. Dissociation was defined as the drug pellet no longer being affixed to the strut and categorized as spontaneous or surgically related.A total of 250 eyes (146 patients) had at least 1 implant placed. Median follow-up time after implant placement was 6 years (range 0.5每9.2 years). Thirty-four dissociations were reported in 30 participants. There were 22 spontaneous events in 22 participants; 6-year cumulative risk of a spontaneous dissociation was 4.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4%每9.1%). The earliest event occurred 4.8 years after placement. Nine of 22 eyes with data had a decline in visual acuity ≡5 letters temporally related to the dissociation. Thirty-nine implant removal surgeries were performed, 33 with replacement. Twelve dissociations were noted during implant removal surgeries in 10 participants (26%, 95% CI 15%每48%); 5 of these eyes had a decline in visual acuity ≡5 letters after surgery. The time from implant placement to removal surgery was longer for the surgeries at which dissociated implants were identified than for those without one (5.7 vs 3.7 years, P < .001). Overall, visual acuity declined 15 or more letters from pre-implant values in 22% of affected eyes; declines were frequently associated with complications of uveitis or its treatment.There is an increasing risk of dissociation of Retisert implants during follow-up; the risk is greater with removal/exchange surgeries, but the risk of both spontaneous and surgically related events increases with longevity of the implants. In 22% of affected eyes visual acuity declined by 15 letters. In the context of eyes with moderate to severe uveitis for years, this rate is not unexpected."
On the formulation of an analytical approach to hydrologic response and similarity at the basin scale,"Vijay K. Gupta, Ed. Waymire, ","Journal of Hydrology, Volume 65, Issues 1每3, August 1983, Pages 95-123, ",The hydrologic response at the basin scale represents the temporally and spatially averaged behavior of water transport in a channel network. Some theoretical studies have recently appeared in the literature which attempt to formulate and solve the problem of how the averaging of the network geometry and the dynamics determines the hydrologic response. A review of these recent papers shows that the incorporation of the network geometry in terms of the Strahler ordered channels is not appropriate. An alternate analytical approach is formulated which requires the use of the path number classification for this purpose. This approach also makes it apparent that the analytical geomorphology (via Shreve's postulates) provides a natural avenue for undertaking analytical investigations on the structure of the hydrologic response. These connections are explored in the vein of formulating and solving the problem of hydrologic similarity.

Of particular significance in this context is the need for a comprehensive quantitative theory of channel networks in three dimensions reflecting the constraints of space filling and available potential energy as well as climatic, hydrologic and geologic controls which are in dynamical equilibrium with channel network forms. Recent progress related to these issues is discussed in a nontechnical way and illustrated with examples, and important open problems are identified."
Experimental study on interaction between a positive mass and a negative effective mass through a mass每spring system,"Jiao Zhou, Yong Cheng, Hongkuan Zhang, Guoliang Huang, Gengkai Hu, ","Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Letters, Volume 5, Issue 5, August 2015, Pages 196-199, ","We investigate the interaction between a positive mass and a negative effective mass through a three-mass chain connected with elastic springs, a pair of masses is designed to have an effective negative mass, and it interacts with the third positive one as if an equivalent two-mass chain. The dynamics of the equivalent two-mass chain shows that the two bodies may be self-accelerated in same direction when the effective mass becomes negative, the experiment is also conducted to demonstrate this type of motion. We further show that the energy principle (Hamilton＊s principle) is applicable if the energy of the negative mass unit is properly characterized. The result may be relevant to composite with cells of effective negative mass, their interaction with matrix may lead to more richer unexpected macroscopic responses."

A total of 91 HIV-positive patients (67 males and 24 females) who underwent 103 procedures (111 implants) were followed up for a mean period of 27 months (range 12每66 months). No occurrences of late implant sepsis were found in 100 implants (94 procedures) in 82 patients at 27 months＊ follow-up (range 12每66 months). Nine patients (9 procedures, 9 implants) developed early infections within 6 weeks and were treated with antibiotics (6 patients), amputation (1 patient) or removal of metal work (2 patients). There was no evidence of subsequent late implant sepsis in any of these patients, at a mean follow-up of 25 months (range 12每52 months). This study demonstrates that it is safe to perform internal fixation in HIV-positive patients, with no observed increase risk of late implant sepsis. There is no indication to remove implants after fracture union, other than for the general clinical indications that may lead to removal of metal work in any patient."
"Loess:: a nonparametric, graphical tool for depicting relationships between variables","William G. Jacoby, ","Electoral Studies, Volume 19, Issue 4, December 2000, Pages 577-613, ","Loess is a powerful but simple strategy for fitting smooth curves to empirical data. The term ※loess§ is an acronym for ※local regression§ and the entire procedure is a fairly direct generalization of traditional least-squares methods for data analysis. Loess is nonparametric in the sense that the fitting technique does not require an a priori specification of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Although it is used most frequently as a scatterplot smoother, loess can be generalized very easily to multivariate data; there are also inferential procedures for confidence intervals and other statistical tests. For all of these reasons, loess is a useful tool for data exploration and analysis in the social sciences. And, loess should be particularly helpful in the field of elections and voting behavior because theories often lead to expectations of nonlinear empirical relationships even though prior substantive considerations provide very little guidance about precise functional forms."
Unstable force analysis for induction motor eccentricity,"Xu Han, Alan Palazzolo, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, Volume 370, 26 May 2016, Pages 230-258, ","The increasing popularity of motors in machinery trains has led to an intensified interest in the forces they produce that may influence machinery vibration. Motor design typically assumes a uniform air gap, however in practice all motors operate with the rotor slightly displaced from the motor centerline in what is referred to as an eccentric position. Rotor center eccentricity can cause a radially unbalanced magnetic field when the motor is operating. This will results in both a radial force pulling the motor further away from the center, and a tangential force which can induce a vibration stability problem. In this paper, a magnetic equivalent circuit MEC modeling method is proposed to calculate both the radial and tangential motor eccentric force. The treatment of tangential force determination is rarely addressed, but it is very important for rotordynamic vibration stability evaluation. The proposed model is also coupled with the motor electric circuit model to provide capability for transient vibration simulations. FEM is used to verify the MEC model. A parametric study is performed on the motor radial and tangential eccentric forces. Also a Jeffcott rotor model is used to study the influence of the motor eccentric force on mechanical vibration stability and nonlinear behavior. Furthermore, a stability criteria for the bearing damping is provided. The motor radial and tangential eccentric forces are both curved fitted to include their nonlinearity in time domain transient simulation for both a Jeffcott rotor model and a geared machinery train with coupled torsional-lateral motion. Nonlinear motions are observed, including limit cycles and bifurcation induced vibration amplitude jumps."
Scene matching using F-histogram-based features with possibilistic C-means optimization,"Ozy Sjahputera, James M. Keller, ","Fuzzy Sets and Systems, Volume 158, Issue 3, 1 February 2007, Pages 253-269, ","This paper outlines further advances from initial findings previously reported in [O. Sjahputera, J.M. Keller, Possibilistic C-means in scene matching, Fourth Internat. Conf. of the European Society for Fuzzy Logic and Technology (EUSFLAT), 2005, pp. 669每675]. We propose a scene matching approach based on spatial relationships among objects in the images to determine if two images acquired under different viewing conditions capture the same scene. This is a difficult problem in computer vision. Our approach produces a mapping of objects from one view to the other, and recovers the viewing transformation parameters. The core of the system relies on capturing spatial relationship information through Force Histograms as affine-invariant image descriptors. Object mapping across images is performed by finding the best correspondence map (FMAP) between force histograms in the two images. The major problem is that the number of potential FMAPs is large, even for modest numbers of scene objects. Hence, search optimization is required. The correct FMAP contains histogram correspondences represented by similar feature vectors. Therefore, dense regions in the feature space are suspected to contain these vectors. Possibilistic C-means (PCM) clustering is used to find these dense regions. The centroids of these dense regions are used to generate the FMAPs. Previously, the FMAP was generated using a nearest-neighbor like approach. In this study, we propose an improved version of this method by incorporating fuzzy memberships into the FMAP building process. Here, the fitness of FMAP candidates are assessed with respect to all histogram correspondences already in FMAP, not just from an initial seed point alone. The best FMAP is selected and translated into a mapping scheme that connects the objects in the two images."

Coordinative integration of copper (II) and iron (II) phthalocyanine into amidoximated PAN fiber for enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation,"Xu Han, Zhenbang Han, Jinfang Li, Jin Zhao, Xiaoming Zhao, ","Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, Volume 533, 1 January 2019, Pages 333-343, ","Metal phthalocyanine (MPc) complexes hold great promise for photocatalysis applications because of their high visible light harvesting efficiency and semiconductive properties. However, the effective development requires the suppression of their rapid charge recombination. Transition metal ions can act as electron traps to enhance the charge separation of semiconductors, but challenges still remain for bimetallic co-catalysis of MPc due to the difficulties in the combination between them. Herein, we proposed a new approach to enable the assisted metal ions to interact with MPc through fibrous support, constructing a novel bimetallic photocatalyst via simultaneously immobilizing iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc) and Cu(II) onto the surface of amidoximated polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber. Taking the photodegradation of organic dyes as model reactions, this bimetallic catalyst achieves much higher photoactivity than that of the monometallic FePc catalyst, and effectively converts surface H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals rather than superoxide radicals and high-valent metal-oxo species. The Cu(II) not only enables the transfer of photoexcited electrons from FePc, but also promotes the running of Fe(II)/Fe(III) cycle to boost reactive radicals generation through H2O2 activation. The strategy of coupling Cu(II) with MPc through fibrous support provides a facile and promising solution for the advancement of MPc-based photocatalysis via visible light energy.Download high-res image (285KB)Download full-size image"
Critical Roles of the Histone Methyltransferase MLL4/KMT2D in Murine Hepatic Steatosis Directed by ABL1 and PPAR污2,"Dae-Hwan Kim, Janghyun Kim, Ji-Sun Kwon, Jaspreet Sandhu, Jae W. Lee, ","Cell Reports, Volume 17, Issue 6, 1 November 2016, Pages 1671-1682, ","The pathophysiologic continuum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease begins with steatosis. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the gene regulatory program directing steatosis, how it is orchestrated at the chromatin level is unclear. PPAR污2 is a hepatic steatotic transcription factor induced by overnutrition. Here, we report that the histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase MLL4/KMT2D directs overnutrition-induced murine steatosis via its coactivator function for PPAR污2. We demonstrate that overnutrition facilitates the recruitment of MLL4 to steatotic target genes of PPAR污2 and their transactivation via H3 lysine 4 methylation because PPAR污2 phosphorylated by overnutrition-activated ABL1 kinase shows enhanced interaction with MLL4. We further show that Pparg2 (encoding PPAR污2) is also a hepatic target gene of ABL1-PPAR污2-MLL4. Consistently, inhibition of ABL1 improves the fatty liver condition of mice with overnutrition by suppressing the pro-steatotic action of MLL4. Our results uncover a murine hepatic steatosis regulatory axis consisting of ABL1-PPAR污2-MLL4, which may serve as a target of anti-steatosis drug development.Download high-res image (220KB)Download full-size image"

An energy measurement based collision resolution protocol,"Sanjeev Khanna, Saswati Sarkar, Insik Shin, ","Teletraffic Science and Engineering, Volume 5, 2003, Pages 951-960, ","A central problem in wireless packet networks is the efficient resolution of collisions among nodes with independent transmission schedules. Natural metrics for measuring the efficiency of any collision resolution scheme include total time taken for collision resolution, average participation time of each transmitter during contention resolution, average number of transmissions made by a transmitter, and average power consumption per a transmitter. While it is straightforward to design a centralized protocol that optimizes along each of these metrics, the challenge is in designing distributed protocols that are efficient along each one of these metrics. No existing approach performs well along all these metrics simultaneously. In this paper, we present EMCRR, a novel randomized distributed collision resolution protocol that is based on power control and energy measurement techniques. We study the performance of EMCRR both analytically and empirically. Our analytical and empirical results closely match each other and show that EMCRR compares very favorably to all existing schemes."
Effective and efficient similarity search in scientific workflow repositories,"Johannes Starlinger, Sarah Cohen-Boulakia, Sanjeev Khanna, Susan B. Davidson, Ulf Leser, ","Future Generation Computer Systems, Volume 56, March 2016, Pages 584-594, ","Scientific workflows have become a valuable tool for large-scale data processing and analysis. This has led to the creation of specialized online repositories to facilitate workflow sharing and reuse. Over time, these repositories have grown to sizes that call for advanced methods to support workflow discovery, in particular for similarity search. Effective similarity search requires both high quality algorithms for the comparison of scientific workflows and efficient strategies for indexing, searching, and ranking of search results. Yet, the graph structure of scientific workflows poses severe challenges to each of these steps. Here, we present a complete system for effective and efficient similarity search in scientific workflow repositories, based on the Layer Decomposition approach to scientific workflow comparison. Layer Decomposition specifically accounts for the directed dataflow underlying scientific workflows and, compared to other state-of-the-art methods, delivers best results for similarity search at comparably low runtimes. Stacking Layer Decomposition with even faster, structure-agnostic approaches allows us to use proven, off-the-shelf tools for workflow indexing to further reduce runtimes and scale similarity search to sizes of current repositories."
Assessing the performance of visual identification tasks using time window-based eye inter-fixation duration,"Jung Hyup Kim, Xinran Zhao, Wei Du, ","International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, Volume 64, March 2018, Pages 15-22, ","The objective of this research was to develop a new eye-tracking metric to evaluate human performance of a visual identification task. According to prior research on eye tracking, eye movement metrics could examine relationships between task performance and eye gaze behaviors. However, little is known about the relationship between the eye movements and the performance on the identification task. In this study, by using the time window-based human-in-the-loop simulation representing an anti-air warfare coordinator, we studied the performance on the identification task and eye tracking data during the experiment. The performance was evaluated by the total number of correctly identified aircraft. Saccade duration (SD) and time windows-based inter-fixation duration (TWID) were used to analyze participants' eye tracking data. Transition number (TN) was also used as a metric to compare SD with TWID. The results indicated that both TWID and SD showed a significant difference between excellent performers and others. The participants who perfectly identified all unknown aircraft had much shorter inter-fixation duration compared to others who made mistakes. However, only the well-skilled performers＊ average TWID was significantly related to TN. The findings of this research supported that TWID could be used as one of the eye movement measures to assess the performance of the identification task in a computer-based environment."

Jabbour, ","Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research, Volume 1793, Issue 7, July 2009, Pages 1315-1324, ","Prokineticins and their receptors are expressed in various cellular compartments in human endometrium, with prokineticin 1 (PROK1) showing a dynamic pattern of expression across the menstrual cycle and during pregnancy. Previous studies suggest that PROK1 can play an important role in implantation and early pregnancy by inducing vascular remodeling and increasing vascular permeability. Here we demonstrate that PROK1 induces the expression of IL-8, a chemokine with angiogenic properties, in endometrial epithelial Ishikawa cells stably expressing prokineticin receptor 1 and in human first trimester decidua. We also show that IL-8 promoter activity is induced by PROK1 and that this requires the presence of AP1 and NFAT motifs. The role of calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway is confirmed by the use of specific chemical inhibitors. Additionally, PROK1 induces the expression of the regulator of calcineurin 1 isoform 4 (RCAN1-4) via the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. A modulatory role for RCAN1-4 is demonstrated by RCAN1-4 overexpression which results in the inhibition of PROK1-induced IL-8 expression whereas reduction in RCAN1-4 endogenous expression results in an increase in PROK1-induced IL-8 production. Our findings show that in endometrial cells PROK1 can activate the calcineurin/NFAT pathway to induce IL-8 expression and that this is negatively modulated by the induction of expression of RCAN1-4."

Previous research on the American states has generated a disparate variety of findings, so there is no scholarly consensus on this question. We argue that many earlier works were limited by their focus on single policy areas or static analyses. To overcome these issues, we analyze yearly data on governmental spending priorities across a full array of policy areas in the 50 states from 1982 through 2011. Our results clearly show that direct democracy states devote more resources to collective goods policies while non-direct democracy states emphasize particularized benefits. This difference occurs because public preferences in direct democracy states are more closely aligned with policy priorities than is the case in states without direct democracy institutions."
Role of coupled flow dynamics and real network structures on Hortonian scaling of peak flows,"Ricardo Mantilla, Vijay K. Gupta, Oscar J. Mesa, ","Journal of Hydrology, Volume 322, Issues 1每4, 15 May 2006, Pages 155-167, ","We investigate how channel flow dynamics on real river networks produces scaling in peak flows. Scaling relations have been defined by log每log linearity between peak flow statistics and drainage areas for idealized mean self-similar networks like Peano and Mandelbrot Viscek. Unlike idealized basins, drainage areas and link lengths in real basins vary statistically. We use Horton每Strahler order as scale parameter instead of drainage area, and use the Hortonian framework to analyze these network structures. A river-network oriented GIS is used to extract the drainage network for the Walnut Gulch basin, Arizona in the United States. It provides the link connectivity structure and the geometric variables for numerically solving coupled link-based mass and momentum conservation equations. The equations are solved for spatially uniform and instantaneous injection of runoff under three different scenarios of flow in the channels: (1) Constant Velocity, (2) Constant Friction, and (3) Spatially Variable Friction. We find that Hortonian scaling in peak flows does not hold for the constant friction scenario. The scaling exponents of peak flows for the other two cases are larger than the scaling exponent of the peaks of the width functions. This property of scaling exponents for a real network is opposite to previous findings for idealized mean self-similar networks. An empirical scaling analysis of peak flows on the Walnut Gulch basin is briefly explained to provide preliminary empirical support to our theoretical findings."

Since Luria, 1966, Luria, 1970 designated this term, two main forms of dynamic aphasia have been identified: one, a language-specific selection deficit at the level of word/sentence generation, associated with left inferior frontal lesions; and two, a domain-general impairment in generating multiple responses or connected speech, associated with more extensive bilateral frontal and/or frontostriatal damage. Both forms of dynamic aphasia have been interpreted as arising due to disturbances in early prelinguistic conceptual preparation mechanisms that are critical for language production. We investigate language-specific and domain-general accounts of dynamic aphasia and address two issues: one, whether deficits in multiple conceptual preparation mechanisms can co-occur; and two, the contribution of broader cognitive processes such as energization, the ability to initiate and sustain response generation over time, to language generation failure. Thus, we report patient WAL who presented with frontal dynamic aphasia in the context of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). WAL was given a series of experimental tests that showed that his dynamic aphasia was not underpinned by a language-specific deficit in selection or in microplanning. By contrast, WAL presented with a domain-general deficit in fluent sequencing of novel thoughts. The latter replicated the pattern documented in a previous PSP patient (Robinson, et al., 2006); however, unique to WAL, generating novel thoughts was impaired but there was no evidence of a sequencing deficit because perseveration was absent. Thus, WAL is the first unequivocal case to show a distinction between novel thought generation and subsequent fluent sequencing. Moreover, WAL's generation deficit encompassed verbal and non-verbal responses, showing a similar (but more profoundly reduced) pattern of performance to frontal patients with an energization deficit. In addition to impaired generation of novel thoughts, WAL presented with a concurrent strategy generation deficit, both falling within the second form of dynamic aphasia comprised of domain-general conceptual preparation mechanisms. Thus, within this second form of dynamic aphasia, concurrent deficits can co-occur. Overall, WAL presented with the second form of dynamic aphasia and was impaired in the generation of novel thoughts and internally-generated strategies, in the context of PSP and bilateral frontostriatal damage."
Recognizing complex instrumental activities of daily living using scene information and fuzzy logic,"Tanvi Banerjee, James M. Keller, Mihail Popescu, Marjorie Skubic, ","Computer Vision and Image Understanding, Volume 140, November 2015, Pages 68-82, ","We describe a novel technique to combine motion data with scene information to capture activity characteristics of older adults using a single Microsoft Kinect depth sensor. Specifically, we describe a method to learn activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs) in order to study the behavior patterns of older adults to detect health changes. To learn the ADLs, we incorporate scene information to provide contextual information to build our activity model. The strength of our algorithm lies in its generalizability to model different ADLs while adding more information to the model as we instantiate ADLs from learned activity states. We validate our results in a controlled environment and compare it with another widely accepted classifier, the hidden Markov model (HMM) and its variations. We also test our system on depth data collected in a dynamic unstructured environment at TigerPlace, an independent living facility for older adults. An in-home activity monitoring system would benefit from our algorithm to alert healthcare providers of significant temporal changes in ADL behavior patterns of frail older adults for fall risk, cognitive impairment, and other health changes."

With recent developments in nanostructures, concerns of uncertainty and risk regarding environment, health, and safety (EHS) cannot be ignored. Thus the concept of ※green nanotechnology§ comes to rescue. The main goal of green nanotechnology is to produce nanostructures without affecting the environment or human health. This can be a viable substitute to the conventional physical and chemical methods of synthesizing nanostructures.This chapter deals with progressive transition toward green nanotechnology and highlights the state of current regulatory rules and standardizations related to nanotechnology and nanostructures for delivery systems.

Tests for overidentifying restrictions in Factor-Augmented VAR models,"Xu Han, ","Journal of Econometrics, Volume 184, Issue 2, February 2015, Pages 394-419, ",This paper develops tests for overidentifying restrictions in Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) models. The identification of structural shocks in FAVAR can involve infinitely many restrictions as the number of cross sections goes to infinity. Our focus is to test the joint null hypothesis that all the restrictions are satisfied. Conventional tests cannot be used due to the large dimension. We transform the infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one by combining the individual statistics across the cross section dimension. We find the limit distribution of our joint test statistic under the null hypothesis and prove that it is consistent against the alternative that a fraction of or all identifying restrictions are violated. The Monte Carlo results show that the joint test statistic has good finite-sample size and power. We implement our tests to an updated version of Stock and Watson＊s (2005) data set. Our test result is further confirmed by the impulse responses of major macroeconomic variables to the monetary policy shock: the impulse responses based on the specification selected by our test are generally more plausible than those based on the specifications rejected by our test.

Complexity of the Minimum Input Selection Problem for Structural Controllability,"Sepehr Assadi, Sanjeev Khanna, Yang Li, Victor M. Preciado, ","IFAC-PapersOnLine, Volume 48, Issue 22, 2015, Pages 70-75, ","We consider the minimum input selection problem for structural controllability (MISSC), stated as follows: Given a linear system x = Ax, where A is a n x n state matrix with m nonzero entries, find the minimum number of states that need to be driven by an external input so that the resulting system is structurally controllable. The fastest algorithm to solve this problem was recently proposed by Olshevsky in (Olshevsky, 2015) and runs in ﹢ (my/n) operations. In this paper, we propose an alternative algorithm to solve MISSC in min{0 (rriy/n), O (n2﹞37), O (m10/7)} operations. This running time is obtained by (i) proving that MISSC problem is computationally equivalent to the maximum bipartite matching (MBM) problem and (ii) considering the three fastest algorithms currently available to solve MBM, namely, the Hopcraft-Karp algorithm, the Mucha-Sankowski algorithm, and Madry's algorithm. Furthermore, our algorithm can directly benefit from future improvements in MBM computation. Conversely, we also show that any algorithmic improvement on solving MISSC would result in an improvement in MBM computation, which would be of great interest for theoretical computer scientists."

A feasibility study on the use of the MOOSE computational framework to simulate three-dimensional deformation of CANDU reactor fuel elements,"Kyle A. Gamble, Anthony F. Williams, Paul K. Chan, Diane Wowk, ","Nuclear Engineering and Design, Volume 293, November 2015, Pages 385-394, ","Horizontally oriented fuel bundles, such as those in CANada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactors present unique modeling challenges. After long irradiation times or during severe transients the fuel elements can laterally deform out of plane due to processes known as bow and sag. Bowing is a thermally driven process that causes the fuel elements to laterally deform when a temperature gradient develops across the diameter of the element. Sagging is a coupled mechanical and thermal process caused by deformation of the fuel pin due to creep mechanisms of the sheathing after long irradiation times and or high temperatures. These out-of-plane deformations can lead to reduced coolant flow and a reduction in coolability of the fuel bundle. In extreme cases element-to-element or element-to-pressure tube contact could occur leading to reduced coolant flow in the subchannels or pressure tube rupture leading to a loss of coolant accident. This paper evaluates the capability of the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework developed at the Idaho National Laboratory to model these deformation mechanisms. The material model capabilities of MOOSE and its ability to simulate contact are also investigated."
The effect of metacognitive monitoring feedback on performance in a computer-based training simulation,"Jung Hyup Kim, ","Applied Ergonomics, Volume 67, February 2018, Pages 193-202, ","This laboratory experiment was designed to study the effect of metacognitive monitoring feedback on performance in a computer-based training simulation. According to prior research on metacognition, the accurate checking of learning is a critical part of improving the quality of human performance. However, only rarely have researchers studied the learning effects of the accurate checking of retrospective confidence judgments (RCJs) during a computer-based military training simulation. In this study, we provided participants feedback screens after they had completed a warning task and identification task in a radar monitoring simulation. There were two groups in this experiment. One group (group A) viewed the feedback screens with the flight path of all target aircraft and the triangular graphs of both RCJ scores and human performance together. The other group (group B) only watched the feedback screens with the flight path of all target aircraft. There was no significant difference in performance improvement between groups A and B for the warning task (Day 1: group A 每 0.347, group B 每 0.305; Day 2: group A 每 0.488, group B 每 0.413). However, the identification task yielded a significant difference in performance improvement between these groups (Day 1: group A 每 0.174, group B 每 0.1555; Day 2: group A 每 0.324, group B 每 0.199). The results show that debiasing self-judgment of the identification task produces a positive training effect on learners. The findings of this study will be beneficial for designing an advanced instructional strategy in a simulation-based training environment."

We systematically investigated fusions in 9,624 tumors across 33 cancer types using multiple fusion calling tools. We identified a total of 25,664 fusions, with a 63% validation rate. Integration of gene expression, copy number, and fusion annotation data revealed that fusions involving oncogenes tend to exhibit increased expression, whereas fusions involving tumor suppressors have the opposite effect. For fusions involving kinases, we found 1,275 with an intact kinase domain, the proportion of which varied significantly across cancer types. Our study suggests that fusions drive the development of 16.5% of cancer cases and function as the sole driver in more than 1% of them. Finally, we identified druggable fusions involving genes such as TMPRSS2, RET, FGFR3, ALK, and ESR1 in 6.0% of cases, and we predicted immunogenic peptides, suggesting that fusions may provide leads for targeted drug and immune therapy.Download high-res image (222KB)Download full-size image"

The percentage of episodes successfully terminated was adjusted for multiple episodes per patient.A total of 717 of 728 (96%) episodes classified as AT or AF were judged to be appropriate detections. By device classification, atrial ATP terminated 187 of 383 (40% adjusted) episodes classified as AT compared with 65 of 240 episodes classified as AF (26% adjusted, p = 0.013). Atrial Ramp or Burst+ ATP terminated 184 of 378 episodes of AT (39% adjusted), whereas 50-Hz Burst pacing therapy terminated only 12 of 109 episodes of AT (12% adjusted) and 65 of 240 episodes of AF (26% adjusted). If efficacy was defined as termination of AT/AF within 20 s of delivery of the pacing therapy, ATP therapies terminated 139 of 383 (32% adjusted) episodes of AT compared with 34 of 240 episodes of AF (15% adjusted, p = 0.003). Efficacy was dependent on AT cycle length. Frequent transitions between AT and AF predicted inefficacy of atrial ATP (p < 0.001). Ventricular proarrhythmia secondary to atrial ATP was not observed.Atrial ATP therapies terminate many episodes of AT without ventricular proarrhythmia. The addition of 50-Hz Burst pacing has minimal efficacy for AT/AF."

This condition is generally accompanied by a vesicular rash. Objectives: We review here a case of fulminant fatal disseminated VZV infection, not accompanied by skin involvement, and the laboratory approaches currently available to diagnose this disease. Study design: Post mortem tissue samples were subjected to histopathological examination, and tested for herpesviruses by electron microscopy and PCR. Results: Intranuclear inclusions were noted by histological examination in the lungs, liver, kidneys and bone marrow. Particles with a herpesvirus morphology were visualized in liver tissue. VZV DNA was detected in liver and bone marrow by PCR followed by sequencing of the amplicons. Viremia was documented by retrospective testing of the serum by PCR. Conclusions: A disseminated VZV infection which proved rapidly fatal was demonstrated in a case without skin manifestations. This rare presentation of VZV infection is potentially underdiagnosed. Testing for VZV viremia by PCR can at the very least suggest the diagnosis although whether plasma-associated viremia is truly pathognomonic of visceral disseminated infection remains to be established."

Transport of juvenile clams: effects of species and sediment grain size,"Heather L. Hunt, ","Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, Volume 312, Issue 2, 6 December 2004, Pages 271-284, ","Erosion and transport of juvenile benthic invertebrates, including bivalves, have the potential to alter patterns of distribution and abundance during the early post-settlement period. However, the factors influencing rates of postlarval dispersal are not well understood. Both hydrodynamics and behaviour (e.g. burrowing) are likely to play a role in determining patterns of transport of juvenile bivalves. To determine the relationship between sediment transport and bivalve dispersal, experiments were conducted in a racetrack flume to examine the effect of grain size, flow, and clam size on rates of erosion of two species of juvenile clams (Mya arenaria and Mercenaria mercenaria). Results of the experiments were compared to predictions of erosion thresholds based on the physical characteristics of the sediment and clams. Erosion of Mercenaria was greater than Mya, the opposite of predictions based on Mercenaria's greater density, indicating the importance of burrowing behaviour. In most cases, erosion also was greater in the finer sand, in contrast to the predicted similarity of erosion thresholds of the two sediments. However, clam erosion did increase with increasing shear velocity and decrease with clam size, as expected. The results of this study indicate that both hydrodynamics and behaviour play roles in the transport of these two species of juvenile bivalves and that their vulnerability to passive erosion cannot be predicted solely from knowledge of sediment transport."

We report the results of detailed in vivo therapeutic investigations demonstrating the high tumor affinity of GA-198AuNPs in severely compromised immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing human prostate tumor xenografts. Intratumoral administration of a single dose of 汕-emitting GA-198AuNPs (70 Gy) resulted in clinically significant tumor regression and effective control in the growth of prostate tumors over 30 days. Three weeks after administration of GA-198AuNPs, tumor volumes for the treated animals were 82% smaller as compared with tumor volume of control group. The treatment group showed only transitory weight loss in sharp contrast to the tumor-bearing control group, which underwent substantial weight loss. Pharmacokinetic studies have provided unequivocal evidence for the optimum retention of therapeutic payload of GA-198AuNPs within the tumor site throughout the treatment regimen with minimal or no leakage of radioactivity to various nontarget organs. The measurements of white and red blood cells, platelets, and lymphocytes within the treatment group resembled those of the normal SCID mice, thus providing further evidence on the therapeutic efficacy and concomitant in vivo tolerance and nontoxic features of GA-198AuNPs.In this study, the biocompatibility and cancer therapeutic applications of glycoprotein (GA) functionalized gold nanoparticles containing b-emitting Au-198 are described in SCID mice bearing human prostate tumor xenografts. The findings of significant therapeutic efficacy, good in vivo tolerance and non-toxic features make these particles ideal candidates for future human applications."

Due to fluid-structure interaction, the airfoil-shaped self-agitator oscillates and generates vortices that improve mixing within the channel and thus improve the heat transfer. The fluid-structure interaction is simulated with the fully coupled method of remeshing. Numerical results show that the self-agitator can generate out-of-phase heaving and rotating motions to enhance heat transfer by 27% without additional power costs and the Nusselt number can be improved by 53% at the same Reynolds number. To investigate the fundamental aspects of the convective heat transfer enhancement with vortex generation, modal analysis is performed for the vorticity and temperature fields with dynamic modal decomposition. Instantaneous results can be constructed with steady mode and six dominant unsteady modes, while the steady mode results can be used to predict the average thermal performance. A prototype of the self-agitator is fabricated and tested experimentally for concept demonstration and validation. The experimental results show the self-agitator can improve the air-side thermal performance in the rectangular channel significantly without additional pumping power."
An improved fast plane wave expansion method for topology optimization of phononic crystals,"Longxiang Xie, Baizhan Xia, Jian Liu, Guoliang Huang, Jirong Lei, ","International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, Volume 120, January 2017, Pages 171-181, ","Phononic crystals (PnCs) are artificially made materials composed of periodically arranged structures capable of manipulating acoustic/elastic wave propagation characteristics. In this paper, an improved fast plane wave expansion method (IFPWEM) is developed to obtain the band structures of PnCs. In the method presented, the continuity of the algorithm has been improved by eliminating the jump discontinuity points as well as decreasing the number of wave vectors used. Implementing these changes results in increased computational efficiency when compared to the traditional fast plane wave expansion method (FPWEM). In order to increase the band gap width produced by the PnCs, an adaptive genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the PnCs structural topology for in-plane wave mode (xy mode). The numerical results yielded from optimization of two-dimension (2D) PnCs with a symmetric square lattice microstructure verifies that the efficiency of the IFPWEM is significantly greater than the conventional FPWEM and finite element methods."
Public opinion during a presidential campaign: Distinguishing the effects of environmental evolution and attitude change,"William G. Jacoby, ","Electoral Studies, Volume 28, Issue 3, September 2009, Pages 422-436, ","This paper develops a spatial model which distinguishes between different sources of temporal variability in public opinion over the course of an election campaign. Candidates and citizens are shown as points within a space. The candidate points are fixed, but their relative positions can change as a result of change over time in the dimension weights. If this occurs, it represents environmental evolution. The individual citizens' points also can move within the space, independently of the external environment. To the extent this occurs, it represents attitude change. The model is tested with data from the CPS 1980 National Election Study. The empirical results show that much of the variability in public evaluations of the candidates is due to evolutionary changes in the electoral environment, rather than individual-level attitude changes. Furthermore, that attitudinal change which does occur is strongly delimited by factors like partisan strength, interest in the campaign, and political participation."
A distance metric for a space of linguistic summaries,"Anna Wilbik, James M. Keller, ","Fuzzy Sets and Systems, Volume 208, 1 December 2012, Pages 79-94, ","Producing linguistic summaries of large databases or temporal sequences of measurements is an endeavor that is receiving increasing attention. These summaries can be used in a continuous monitoring situation, like eldercare, where it is important to ascertain if the current summaries represent an abnormal condition. It is therefore necessary to compute the distance between summaries as a basis for such a determination. In this paper, we propose a dissimilarity measure between summaries based on fuzzy protoforms, and prove that this measure is a metric. We take into account not only the linguistic meaning of the summaries, but also two quality evaluations, namely the truth values and the degrees of focus. We present examples of how the distance metric behaves and show that it corresponds with intuition."

Promotion of cooperation by adaptive interaction: The role of heterogeneity in neighborhoods,"Xu Han, Xiaowei Zhao, Haoxiang Xia, ","Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, Volume 502, 15 July 2018, Pages 483-491, ","Evolution of cooperation in prisoner＊s dilemma games has been studied extensively in the past decades. Recent studies have investigated the effect of adaptive interaction intensity on spatial prisoner＊s dilemma, showing that if individuals can adjust their interaction intensity with each opponent at the same extent, cooperation can be promoted in a proper scale. However, the previous studies about adaptive interaction willingness do not consider the heterogeneity of the opponents. In this paper, a simulative model is developed to examine whether and how the interactive diversity influences cooperation in the spatial prisoner＊s dilemma games, in which individuals consider the corresponding behavior of different opponents. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively promote cooperation, and the average payoff of the system can significantly be improved by high interaction intensity between cooperators. In addition, we also show four kinds of different individuals to analyze the evolution progresses. The simulations show that cooperators on the boundary decrease their interaction willingness, which makes the boundary defectors lose their opportunity to participate in the interaction and be invaded by cooperators."
A decision support tool for energy efficient synchromodal supply chains,"Nasibeh Zanjirani Farahani, James S. Noble, Cerry M. Klein, Moein Enayati, ","Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 186, 10 June 2018, Pages 682-702, ","The industrial supply chain is a significant consumer of limited energy resources worldwide. Companies have been encouraged to reduce energy costs by restructuring their logistics network, improving their transportation asset fuel efficiency, and reducing travel distance. The recent evolution of synchromodal supply chains has focused on flexible transportation modes as a new option for supply chain managers to reduce the total energy cost. Illustrating the monetary advantages of such reconfigurations will guide decision makers to get the most from all available options.In this paper, the process of modeling and developing a user-friendly, customizable tool for supply chain decision makers called the Synchromodal Supply Chain Energy Analysis tool (SySCEA) is presented. SySCEA enables the analysis of the overall environmental and economic effects due to supply chain fuel consumption and changing network configuration as it relates to order quantity, demand quantity, product size, packaging, mode and transportation assets. Currently, SySCEA supports up to five arc/routes, plus the first and last mile, for a synchromodal supply chain. However, due to the modular nature of the tool it is simple to extend it to larger networks."

Experts disagreed on the stage classification in 620 of 1553 comparisons (40%), plus disease classification (including pre-plus) in 287 of 1553 comparisons (18%), zone in 117 of 1553 comparisons (8%), and overall ROP category in 618 of 1553 comparisons (40%). However, agreement for presence versus absence of type 1 disease was >95%. There were no differences between image-based and clinical classification except for zone III disease.The most common area of discrepancy in ROP classification is stage, although inter-expert agreement for clinically significant disease, such as presence versus absence of type 1 and type 2 disease, is high. There were no differences between image-based grading and clinical examination in the ability to detect clinically significant disease. This study provides additional evidence that image-based classification of ROP reliably detects clinically significant levels of ROP with high accuracy compared with the clinical examination."

Considerations for improving assay sensitivity in chronic pain clinical trials: IMMPACT recommendations,"Robert H. Dworkin, Dennis C. Turk, Sarah Peirce-Sandner, Laurie B. Burke, Dan Ziegler, ","PAIN, Volume 153, Issue 6, June 2012, Pages 1148-1158, ","A number of pharmacologic treatments examined in recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have failed to show statistically significant superiority to placebo in conditions in which their efficacy had previously been demonstrated. Assuming the validity of previous evidence of efficacy and the comparability of the patients and outcome measures in these studies, such results may be a consequence of limitations in the ability of these RCTs to demonstrate the benefits of efficacious analgesic treatments vs placebo (※assay sensitivity§). Efforts to improve the assay sensitivity of analgesic trials could reduce the rate of falsely negative trials of efficacious medications and improve the efficiency of analgesic drug development. Therefore, an Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials consensus meeting was convened in which the assay sensitivity of chronic pain trials was reviewed and discussed. On the basis of this meeting and subsequent discussions, the authors recommend consideration of a number of patient, study design, study site, and outcome measurement factors that have the potential to affect the assay sensitivity of RCTs of chronic pain treatments. Increased attention to and research on methodological aspects of clinical trials and their relationships with assay sensitivity have the potential to provide the foundation for an evidence-based approach to the design of analgesic clinical trials and expedite the identification of analgesic treatments with improved efficacy and safety."

It follows on from the work of the 2015 Lancet Commission, which concluded that the response to climate change could be ※the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century§. The Lancet Countdown aims to track the health impacts of climate hazards; health resilience and adaptation; health co-benefits of climate change mitigation; economics and finance; and political and broader engagement. These focus areas form the five thematic working groups of the Lancet Countdown and represent different aspects of the complex association between health and climate change. These thematic groups will provide indicators for a global overview of health and climate change; national case studies highlighting countries leading the way or going against the trend; and engagement with a range of stakeholders. The Lancet Countdown ultimately aims to report annually on a series of indicators across these five working groups. This paper outlines the potential indicators and indicator domains to be tracked by the collaboration, with suggestions on the methodologies and datasets available to achieve this end. The proposed indicator domains require further refinement, and mark the beginning of an ongoing consultation process〞from November, 2016 to early 2017〞to develop these domains, identify key areas not currently covered, and change indicators where necessary. This collaboration will actively seek to engage with existing monitoring processes, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and WHO's climate and health country profiles. The indicators will also evolve over time through ongoing collaboration with experts and a range of stakeholders, and be dependent on the emergence of new evidence and knowledge. During the course of its work, the Lancet Countdown will adopt a collaborative and iterative process, which aims to complement existing initiatives, welcome engagement with new partners, and be open to developing new research projects on health and climate change."

Solidification behavior of 6061 wrought aluminum alloy during rheo-diecasting process with self-inoculation method,"Ming LI, Yuan-dong LI, Hong-qiang ZHENG, Xiao-feng HUANG, Ying MA, ","Transactions of Nonferrous Metals Society of China, Volume 28, Issue 5, May 2018, Pages 879-889, ","The semisolid slurry of the 6061 wrought aluminum alloy was prepared by the self-inoculation method (SIM). The effects of the isothermal holding parameters on microstructures of rheo-diecastings were investigated, and the solidification behavior of 6061 wrought aluminum alloy during the rheo-diecasting process was analyzed using OM, SEM, EDS and EBSD. The results indicate that the isothermal holding process during slurry preparation has great effect on primary 汐(Al) particles (汐1), but has little effect on the microstructure of secondary solidification in the process of thin-walled rheo-diecasting. Nucleation is expected to take place in the entire remaining liquid when the remaining liquid fills the die cavity, and the secondary solidification particles (汐2) are formed after the process of stable growth, unstable growth and merging. The solute concentration of remaining liquid is higher than that of the original alloy due to the existence of 汐1 particles, hence the contents of Mg and Si in 汐2 particles are higher than those in 汐1 particles."
Identification and functional characterization of an uncharacterized antimicrobial peptide from a ciliate Paramecium caudatum,"Pengfei Cui, Yuan Dong, Zhijian Li, Yubo Zhang, Shicui Zhang, ","Developmental & Comparative Immunology, Volume 60, July 2016, Pages 53-65, ","The global ever-growing concerns about multi-drug resistant (MDR) microbes leads to urgent demands for exploration of new antibiotics including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Here we demonstrated that a cDNA from Ciliata Paramecium caudatum, designated Pcamp1, coded for a protein with features characteristic of AMPs, which is not homologous to any AMPs currently known. Both the C-terminal 91 amino acid residues of PcAMP1, cPcAMP1, expressed in Escherichia coli and the C-terminal 26 amino acid residues (predicted mature AMP), cPcAMP1/26, synthesized, underwent a coil-to-helix transition in the presence of TFE, SDS or DPC. Functional assays revealed that cPcAMP1 and cPcAMP1/26 were both able to kill Aeromonas hydrophila and Staphylococcus aureus. ELISA showed that cPcAMP1 and cPcAMP1/26 were able to bind to microbe-associated molecular pattern molecules LPS and LTA, which was further corroborated by the observations that cPcAMP1 could deposit onto the bacterial membranes. Importantly, both cPcAMP1 and cPcAMP1/26 were able to induce bacterial membrane permeabilization and depolarization, and to increase intracellular ROS levels. Additionally, cPcAMP1 and cPcAMP1/26 were not cytotoxic to mammalian cells. Taken together, our results show that PcAMP1 is a potential AMP with a membrane selectivity towards bacterial cells, which renders it a promising template for the design of novel peptide antibiotics against MDR microbes. It also shows that use of signal conserved sequence of AMPs can be an effective tool to identify potential AMPs across different animal classes."

ScriptEase: A generative/adaptive programming paradigm for game scripting,"Maria Cutumisu, Curtis Onuczko, Matthew McNaughton, Thomas Roy, Stephanie Gillis, ","Science of Computer Programming, Volume 67, Issue 1, 1 June 2007, Pages 32-58, ","The traditional approach to implementing interactions between a player character (PC) and objects in computer games is to write scripts in a procedural scripting language. These scripts are usually so complex that they must be written by a computer programmer rather than by the author of the game story. This interruption in the game story authoring process has two distinct disadvantages: it increases the cost of game production and it introduces a disconnect between the author＊s intentions and the interactions produced from the programmer＊s written scripts. We introduce a mechanism to solve these problems. We show that game authors (non-programmers) can generate the necessary scripts for implementing meaningful interactions between the PC and game objects using a three-step process. In the first step, the author uses a generative pattern (concept) to create a high-level description of a commonly occurring game scenario. In the second step, the author uses a standard set of adaptation operations to customize the high-level description to the particular circumstances of the story that is being told. In the third step, the author presses a button that automatically generates scripting code from the adapted pattern. We describe the results of three studies in which a combined total of 56 game story authors used this three-step process to construct Neverwinter Nights game stories, using a tool called ScriptEase. We believe that this generative/adaptive process is the key to future game story scripting. More generally, this article advocates the development of adaptive programming as an alternative to current constructive programming techniques, as well as the application of adaptive programming in many domains."

Early data from the International Society of Pediatric Oncology suggested decreased intraoperative spillage but increased risk of local recurrence after PC. Patients with WT at our institution were managed with PC until 1996; subsequently, they underwent PN. This study compares these approaches as they affect tumor spillage, local recurrence, and survival.Patients with WT diagnosed at the Hospital for Sick Children from 1985 to 2003 were reviewed.One hundred sixty patients were identified (114 PC and 46 PN). Tumor spill occurred in 6 (5.3%) of 114 PC and 2 (4.3%) of 46 PN patients. Tumor inhomogeneity, tumor size, and inferior vena cava compression/clot at diagnosis did not affect incidence of spill. Of 6 PC patients with surgical spill, 1 (17%) had significant tumor shrinkage, compared with 87 (81%) of 108 without spill (P < .001). Preoperative chemotherapy and PN had equal rates of surgical complications. Preoperative chemotherapy resulted in 12 (10.5%) of 114 local recurrences vs 5 (10.8%) of 46 with PN. Event-free survival and overall survival were 80% and 92% for PC at 129 months vs 85% and 96% for PN at 61 months.Preoperative chemotherapy and PN are equally effective in the treatment of WT with no difference in tumor spillage. Failure of the tumor to shrink in size with PC was significantly associated with an increase in tumor spillage and would suggest that a more cautious surgical approach be undertaken in these cases."

The RSN model predicts that such variables exhibit statistical simple scaling, when indexed by Horton每Strahler order. The average side tributary structure of RSN networks also exhibits Tokunaga-type self-similarity which is widely observed in nature. We examine the scaling structure of distributions of the maximum of the width function for RSNs for nested, complete Strahler basins by performing ensemble simulations. The maximum of the width function exhibits distributional simple scaling, when indexed by Horton每Strahler order, for both RSNs and natural river networks extracted from digital elevation models (DEMs). We also test a powerlaw relationship between Horton ratios for the maximum of the width function and drainage areas. These results represent first steps in formulating a comprehensive physical statistical theory of floods at multiple space-time scales for RSNs as discrete hierarchical branching structures."
Exploring the interactions between resource availability and the utilisation of semi-natural habitats by insect pollinators in an intensive agricultural landscape,"Lorna J. Cole, Sarah Brocklehurst, Duncan Robertson, William Harrison, David I. McCracken, ","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, Volume 246, 1 August 2017, Pages 157-167, ","Intensification of agriculture and associated loss of habitat heterogeneity is a key driver of global declines in insect pollinators. Pollinators utilise different habitats to meet resource requirements throughout their life-span and it is widely accepted that their conservation requires a landscape-scale approach. Information on the mechanisms driving insect pollinators at the landscape scale is, however, lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, this novel study explores how pollinators utilise different habitats within a landscape and how utilisation changes over the season. Floral resources and insect pollinators (i.e. bumblebee, butterflies and hoverflies) were monitored during peak pollinator activity periods on a wide range of agricultural and semi-natural habitats in an intensive grassland landscape.The availability of key foraging resources differed between semi-natural habitats and this was strongly linked to their utilisation by pollinators. Floral resources were most abundant and diverse in road verges, riparian buffer strips and open scrub. These were key habitats for butterflies, with road verges and buffer strips also being important for hoverflies and bumblebees. The relative value of semi-natural habitats in providing floral resources changed throughout the season. Pollinators appeared to respond to changes in key floral resources, dynamically using different semi-natural habitats to meet their requirements. Maintaining landscape heterogeneity and improving the quality of semi-natural habitats to ensure resource diversity and continuity is fundamental to pollinator conservation. Regionally targeting agri-environment spending could result in the simplification of agricultural landscapes with consequences on insect pollinators and biodiversity as a whole.The role that habitat diversity plays in the provisioning of resources for insect pollinators at the landscape scale.Download high-res image (316KB)Download full-size image"
Techniques for microscale patterning of zeolite-based thin films,"Swarnasri Mandal, Heather L. Williams, Heather K. Hunt, ","Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, Volume 203, February 2015, Pages 245-258, ","Micro- and nano-scale devices have made a significant impact on electrical, optical, mechanical, and medicinal platforms, such as microchips, environmental sensors, and smart implants. Of particular interest for these devices is the use of nanoporous materials, such as aerogels, zeolites, and mesoporous materials, whose inherent nano- to micro-scale porosity provides potentially beneficial properties that could be harnessed for these devices, particularly when the materials are synthesized in thin film form. However, the primary challenge to utilizing these materials remains the ability to fabricate or pattern the thin film materials into appropriate micro- and nano-scale features. A number of techniques have been developed to address the issue of patterning thin films of nonporous materials, from bottom-up approaches, like chemical or mechanical assembly, to top-down approaches, such as sputtering, ablation, and lithography. However, most of the patterning techniques represented in the literature for thin film materials are typically less compatible with porous thin films, particularly microporous and mesoporous thin films. Here, we present a review of the various patterning techniques that have been either heavily investigated or proposed for microporous thin film materials, along with their advantages and potential limitations. Specifically, we focus on top-down, bottom-up, and deposition-based approaches that have yielded micro- to nano-scale patterning abilities for zeolite-based materials. Given the unique physical, chemical, mechanical, and structural properties of zeolites and other inherently-nanostructured materials, the ability to choose and adapt an appropriate patterning technique will greatly enhance the success of their utilization in micro-scale and potentially nanoscale device fabrication.Download high-res image (81KB)Download full-size image"
A Unifying Model of Orientation Crowding in Peripheral Vision,"William J. Harrison, Peter J. Bex, ","Current Biology, Volume 25, Issue 24, 21 December 2015, Pages 3213-3219, ","Peripheral vision is fundamentally limited not by the visibility of features, but by the spacing between them [1]. When too close together, visual features can become ※crowded§ and perceptually indistinguishable. Crowding interferes with basic tasks such as letter and face identification and thus informs our understanding of object recognition breakdown in peripheral vision [2]. Multiple proposals have attempted to explain crowding [3], and each is supported by compelling psychophysical and neuroimaging data [4, 5, 6] that are incompatible with competing proposals. In general, perceptual failures have variously been attributed to the averaging of nearby visual signals [7, 8, 9, 10], confusion between target and distractor elements [11, 12], and a limited resolution of visual spatial attention [13]. Here we introduce a psychophysical paradigm that allows systematic study of crowded perception within the orientation domain, and we present a unifying computational model of crowding phenomena that reconciles conflicting explanations. Our results show that our single measure produces a variety of perceptual errors that are reported across the crowding literature. Critically, a simple model of the responses of populations of orientation-selective visual neurons accurately predicts all perceptual errors. We thus provide a unifying mechanistic explanation for orientation crowding in peripheral vision.

Jacoby, ","Electoral Studies, Volume 28, Issue 4, December 2009, Pages 584-594, ","This paper examines the impact of liberal-conservative ideology on voting behavior in the 2004 presidential election, using data from the CPS National Election Study for that year. The empirical results show that there was widespread recognition of the candidates' and parties' ideological positions. However, liberal-conservative identifications exerted no direct impact on voting choices within the 2004 electorate. On the other hand, liberal-conservative identifications did show an indirect effect which operated through their influence on the more proximate determinants of electoral decisions. These findings clarify the role of ideology in the 2004 presidential election. They also conform very closely to the basic theoretical structure laid out in The American Voter.This paper examines the role of ideology as a determinant of recent voting behavior in the American electorate. The analysis uses data from the 2004 CPS National Election Study, and the empirical results suggest a somewhat complicated interpretation. On the one hand, liberal-conservative orientations had no direct impact whatsoever on citizens' voting choices. On the other hand, mass perceptions and evaluations of the candidates, issues, and conditions within the external environment were clearly structured along ideological lines. And, the latter did influence electoral decisions. Therefore, liberal-conservative ideology exerted an important, but completely indirect, effect on citizens' 2004 voting choices. These findings have important implications, not only for understanding the role of ideology in American elections, but also for theories of voting behavior."
Experimental demonstration of a dissipative multi-resonator metmaterial for broadband elastic wave attenuation,"Miles V. Barnhart, Xianchen Xu, Yangyang Chen, Shun Zhang, Guoliang Huang, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, In press, accepted manuscript, Available online 10 September 2018, ","Elastic metamaterials (EMMs) encompass a relatively new class of composite materials that exhibit unique dynamic effective material properties and possess the ability to mitigate or even completely inhibit the propagation of acoustic/elastic waves over specific frequency spectrums (band gaps). However, it is extremely difficult to achieve broadband energy absorption with single resonance based EMMs. Dissipative EMMs with multiple resonators have recently been suggested for the attenuation of elastic wave energy spanning broad frequency spectrums. In this study, we fabricate a dissipative EMM with multiple resonators comprised from layered spherical inclusions embedded in an epoxy matrix and experimentally demonstrate broadband elastic wave mitigation. An analytical solution combined with numerical simulations is used to validate the accuracy of the fabrication based on a single unit cell test. We also numerically investigate the dynamic wave dispersion behavior of the fabricated dissipative EMM and find that the two strong attenuation regions induced by the two internal resonators can be effectively combined into a broadband wave attenuation region by the intrinsic damping properties of the constitutive materials used in the design. This broadband wave attenuation is finally demonstrated through an impact test performed on finite EMM samples where the frequency spectrum of the transmitted amplitude is in very good agreement with the numerical results. This design can be easily scaled and implemented into different length scales, which will benefit a range of applications requiring broadband vibration elastic wave, and/or seismic wave mitigation."
Biodistribution of maltose and gum arabic hybrid gold nanoparticles after intravenous injection in juvenile swine,"Genevieve M. Fent, Stan W. Casteel, Dae Young Kim, Raghuraman Kannan, Kattesh Katti, ","Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine, Volume 5, Issue 2, June 2009, Pages 128-135, ","This article describes several experiments performed to test our hypothesis that the agent used to coat/stabilize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) will act to direct the AuNPs to specific tissues within the body and that changing the coating will change the target organ. Samples were also collected for pathological examination. Gum arabic每 (GA) and maltose- (MALT) stabilized AuNPs were administered intravenously to juvenile swine, and blood, tissue, and urine samples were collected for gold analysis. Our results indicate that differences do exist between the two NP constructs tested, with 50% or greater of the total gold dose being found in the liver or lung for the GA- and MALT-stabilized AuNPs, respectively. These findings indicate that the functional unit used to coat/stabilize the AuNPs has an important role in determining the tissue distribution profile for individual AuNP constructs."
Estimating regional coal resource efficiency in China using three-stage DEA and bootstrap DEA models,"Yijia Cui, Guoliang Huang, Ziyong Yin, ","International Journal of Mining Science and Technology, Volume 25, Issue 5, September 2015, Pages 861-864, ","Based on three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model estimates of resource utilization efficiency of coal, we selected 29 provinces from China＊s 2012 input每output data and used the bootstrap DEA model to correct the bias.

Moreover, the comprehensive technical efficiency score indicates that the scale is invalid. Area utilization efficiencies for the eastern, central, and western regions were 0.917, 0.731, and 0.629, respectively. The results prove that there are significant differences in the distribution of coal resources utilization efficiency across regions."

In exploratory analyses, we evaluated the relationship between hospital-level IHCA incidence and outcomes with general hospital-wide quality improvement activities.Retrospective cohort study of 2,205,123 hospitalizations at 101 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals between 2008 and 2012.Risk- and reliability-adjusted hospital-level IHCA incidence and survival to hospital discharge.A total of 8821 (0.40%) IHCA occurred between 2008 and 2012, with no significant change in risk-adjusted incidence over this time (P = .77). Hospital-level IHCA incidence varied substantially across facilities, with a median hospital incidence of 4.0 per 1000 hospitalizations and a range from 1.4 to 11.8 per 1000 hospitalizations. Overall, survival to discharge after IHCA was 31.2%. Risk-adjusted odds of survival increased over the study period (2012 vs 2008, OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.27, 1.75) but survival varied substantially across facilities from 20.3% to 45.4%. General hospital quality improvement activities were inconsistently associated with IHCA incidence and survival.Within the VHA, the incidence and outcomes of IHCA showed important trends over time but varied substantially across hospitals with no consistent link to general hospital quality improvement activities. Identification of specific resuscitation practices at hospitals with low incidence and high survival of IHCA may guide further improvements for inhospital resuscitation."
"Policy attitudes, ideology and voting behavior in the 2008 Election","William G.

At the same time, voting behavior was not particularly aligned along stark policy divisions; the direct effects of issue attitudes were confined largely to the most sophisticated stratum of the electorate. Finally, liberal-conservative orientations did affect citizens' political attitudes and candidate choices in ways that are fairly unique, compared to other recent elections."
A three-dimensional unit cell model with controllable crimped structure for investigating finite strain response of collagen fiber reinforced biological composites,"Li Liu, Dean Hu, Xu Han, ","Composites Science and Technology, Volume 164, 18 August 2018, Pages 178-186, ","Composite materials reinforced by crimped fibers, such as collagen fibers, have a widely application in the advanced structures. Therefore, an effective and achievable model is significant for explicitly describing the geometry of the crimped fibers and evaluating their mechanical behaviors. Aiming at this purpose, a three-dimensional (3D) unit cell model (UCM) is developed based on the microstructure of the collagen fibers, in which a controllable modified sinusoidal waviness fiber is explicitly embedded into the soft matrix, and an effective periodic boundary condition is applied on the proposed 3D UCM by using the multi-points constraint equations. The accuracy and validity of the proposed model are verified by comparing with the existing experimental results. For investigating the influence of the geometric parameters on the mechanical responses of the crimped fiber reinforced composites, several numerical UCMs with different geometric parameters are presented. The obtained results reveal that the parameters of crimp amplitude H and waviness 聿 of the fibers mainly contribute to the flexibility of the materials. The parameter 肋 for characterizing the roughness of the fibers is associated with the size and position of largest stress region. Moreover, the fiber radius R plays an important role in determining the bearing capacity of the materials and an excellent mechanical property, e.g., not only withstands the large initial tensile load but also has a special ability to guarantee the flexibility of the materials, may be achieved by controlling the number of the fibers with big and small radii."

The FRP decks considered consist of contiguous thin-walled box sections and are fabricated by bonding side-by-side pultruded thin-walled box beams, which are placed transversely over FRP composite stringers. In this study, we review the modeling and experimental verification of FRP structural beams, including micro/macro-mechanics predictions of ply and laminate properties, beam bending response, shear-lag effect, and local and global buckling behaviors. A simplified design analysis procedure for cellular FRP bridge decks is developed based on a first-order shear deformation macro-flexibility (SDMF) orthotropic plate solution. The present approach can allow the designers to analyze, design and optimize material architectures and shapes of FRP beams, as well as various bridge deck configurations, before their implementation in the field. Experimental studies of cellular FRP bridge decks are conducted to obtain stiffness coefficients, and an example of a cellular FRP deck on optimized winged-box FRP stringers under actual track-loading is presented to illustrate the analytical method. The experimental-analytical approach presented in this study is used to propose simplified engineering design equations for new and replacement highway FRP deck-and-stringer bridges."

Mutations in TBX5 cause Holt-Oram syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition that affects the formation of the heart and upper-limb. Several studies have provided significant insight into the role of TBX5 in cardiogenesis; however, how TBX5 activity is regulated by other factors is still unknown. Here we report that histone acetyltransferases KAT2A and KAT2B associate with TBX5 and acetylate it at Lys339. Acetylation potentiates its transcriptional activity and is required for nuclear retention. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of kat2a and kat2b transcripts in zebrafish severely perturb heart and limb development, mirroring the tbx5a knockdown phenotype. The phenotypes found in MO-injected embryos were also observed when we introduced mutations in the kat2a or kat2b genes using the CRISPR-Cas system. These studies highlight the importance of KAT2A and KAT2B modulation of TBX5 and their impact on heart and limb development."

The ER-汕 expression was statistically significantly elevated in the adenomyotic functionalis gland during the proliferative phase and throughout the myometrium across the entire menstrual cycle. Expression of PR-A was similar to that of PR-B, with reduced expression in the basalis stroma, and inner and outer myometrium in the adenomyotic samples. The pattern of ER-汕, PR-A, and PR-B expression was similar in the endometrial basalis and adenomyotic foci.These data suggest ER-汕 expression and the lack of PR expression are related to the development and/or progression of adenomyosis and might explain the poor response of adenomyosis-associated menstrual symptoms to progestational agents."

Three PCR ribotypes predominated amongst the Scottish isolates of C. difficile; ribotype 106 (29.4%), ribotype 001 (22%) and ribotype 027 (12.6%) followed by the less prevalent ribotypes including 002, 015, 014, 078, 005, 023 and 020. The distribution of ribotypes varied between healthboard areas. Ribotype 106 or 001 was the predominant ribotype in 10 healthboard areas, while ribotype 027 was the predominant type in two neighbouring areas. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of C. difficile isolates showed high frequencies of resistance to moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, erythromycin and cefotaxime in the epidemic C. difficile ribotypes 001, 027 and 106 compared to other less common ribotypes. Furthermore, reduced susceptibility to metronidazole was found only in the epidemic strains. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that fluoroquinolones, macrolides and cephalosporins may play a role in the spread of C. difficile in Scotland (while the role of metronidazole needs further investigations), and highlights the role of antimicrobial stewardship in preventing and controlling C. difficile infection (CDI)."

Reply to Pachai et al.,"William J. Harrison, Peter J. Bex, ","Current Biology, Volume 26, Issue 9, 9 May 2016, Pages r353-r354, ","Peripheral vision is fundamentally limited by the spacing between objects. When asked to report a target＊s identity, observers make erroneous reports that sometimes match the identity of a nearby distractor and sometimes match a combination of target and distractor features. The classification of these errors has previously been used to support competing ＆substitution＊ [1] or ＆averaging＊ [2] models of the phenomenon known as ＆visual crowding＊. We recently proposed a single model in which both classes of error occur because observers make their reports by sampling from a biologically-plausible population of weighted responses within a region of space around the target [3]. It is critical to note that there is no probabilistic substitution or averaging process in our model; instead, we argue that neither substitution nor averaging occur, but that these are misclassifications of the distribution of reports that emerge when a population response distribution is sampled. This is a fundamentally different way of thinking about crowding, and on this basis we claim to have provided a mechanism unifying categorically distinct perceptual errors. Our goal was not to model all crowding phenomena, such as the release from crowding when target and flanks differ in color or depth [4]. Pachai et al.[5] have suggested that our model is not unifying because it inaccurately predicts perceptual performance for a particular stimulus. Although we agree that our model does not predict their data, this specific demonstration overlooks the critical aspect of the model: perceptual reports are drawn from a weighted population code. We show that Pachai et al.＊s [5] own data actually provide evidence for the population code we have described [3], and we suggest a biologically-plausible analysis of their stimuli that provides a computational basis for their ＆grouping＊ account of crowding."

Separation efficiency is correlated with two dimensionless groups. The first is the Archimedes number. It is a ratio of buoyant force to viscous force. The second dimensionless group is defined in this work. The Espanani number is the ratio of the pressure force to the viscous force. Excellent correlation between separation efficiency and the product of the Archimedes number and the Espanani number is observed. This observation informs both process and equipment design."
Accessing characters in spoken Chinese disyllables: An ERP study on the resolution of auditory ambiguity,"Xuqian Chen, Guoliang Huang, Jian Huang, ","Neuroscience Letters, Volume 610, 1 January 2016, Pages 187-192, ","Chinese differs from most Indo-European languages in its phonological, lexical, and syntactic structures. One of its unique properties is the abundance of homophones at the monosyllabic/morphemic level, with the consequence that monosyllabic homophones are all ambiguous in speech perception. Two-morpheme Chinese words can be composed of two high homophone-density morphemes (HH words), two low homophone-density morphemes (LL words), or one high and one low homophone-density morphemes (LH or HL words). The assumption of a simple inhibitory homophone effect is called into question in the case of disyllabic spoken word recognition, in which the recognition of one morpheme is affected by semantic information given by the other. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were used to trace on-line competitions among morphemic homophones in accessing Chinese disyllables. Results showing significant differences in ERP amplitude when comparing LL and LH words, but not when comparing LL and HL words, suggested that the first morpheme cannot be accessed without feedback from the second morpheme. Most importantly, analyses of N400 amplitude among different densities showed a converse homophone effect in which LL words, rather than LH or HL words, triggered larger N400. These findings provide strong evidence of a dynamic integration system at work during spoken Chinese disyllable recognition."

Adsorption of iodine on graphite in High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor systems: A review,"Kyle L. Walton, Tushar K. Ghosh, Dabir S. Viswanath, Sudarshan K. Loyalka, Robert V. Tompson, ","Progress in Nuclear Energy, Volume 73, May 2014, Pages 21-50, ","Adsorption of iodine on graphite is of great interest for operation and safety of high temperature nuclear reactors. Graphite can adsorb significant amounts of iodine and retain it for a long period of time. Significant amount of work on this subject has been done in the past. Various types of adsorption apparatus have been designed and data were collected. The types of graphite used in past studies are not available anymore, and as a consequence the data are not applicable for the new type of commercial nuclear grade graphites. However, the past experimental systems, data, and their analysis are useful to design a better experimental system, collect more accurate data, and, provide better understanding of the adsorption process and data. In addition the existing data can be used to generate a framework to understand the types of adsorption processes taking place. In this work, we have conducted an exhaustive literature review and further analyzed the data. Four adsorption isotherms; the Langmuir, the Freundlich, and the two isotherms proposed in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Tecdoc-978 were used to correlate the available equilibrium adsorption data. For most of the data, the simple Langmuir and the Freundlich isotherms provided a reasonable fit of the data. The Polyani's potential theory was also used to check the consistency of the data and as indicated by the theory, most of the data set provided a single characteristic curve. The isosteric heats of adsorption calculated using the literature data suggested that iodine-adsorption on graphite could be a chemisorption process."

We found functionally significant estrogen receptor-regulated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and gene/lncRNA interaction networks. Pathway analysis identified subtypes with high leukocyte infiltration, raising potential implications for immunotherapy. Using 16 key molecular features, we identified five prognostic subtypes and developed a decision tree that classified patients into the subtypes based on just six features that are assessable in clinical laboratories."
Resistance of Human 汕B2-crystallin to in vivo Modification,"Zhongli Zhang, Larry L David, David L Smith, Jean B Smith, ","Experimental Eye Research, Volume 73, Issue 2, August 2001, Pages 203-211, ","Post-translational modifications and/or structural changes induced by modifications are likely causes of the decrease in crystallin solubility associated with aging and the development of cataract. Characterization of human lens crystallins by mass spectrometry has demonstrated that 汕B2-crystallin undergoes less modification than any of the other crystallins. As the lens ages, 汕B2-crystallin retains its hydrophilic N-terminus while the hydrophilic C-termini of 汐-crystallins and large portions of the N-termini of 汕A3/A1 and 汕B1 are truncated. The hydrophilic terminal regions of crystallins contribute to their solubility. Furthermore, deamidation and disulfide bond formation, other modifications that may affect solubility by altering conformation, are less extensive in 汕B2 than in the other crystallins. This resistance to modification results in higher levels of 汕B2 compared with the other crystallins in the water-soluble fraction of older lenses. The solubility of 汕B2 and its propensity to form non-covalent associations with less soluble 汕-crystallins may contribute to the solubility of the other 汕-crystallins. A current hypothesis is that the chaperone-like properties of 汐-crystallins contribute to lens crystallin solubility, particularly in younger lenses. In older lenses, where most of the 汐-crystallins have become water-insoluble, 汕B2-crystallins may play a dominant role in lens crystallin solubility."
Improvement of rank histograms for verifying the reliability of extreme event ensemble forecasts,"Jing Xu, Aizhong Ye, Qingyun Duan, Feng Ma, Zheng Zhou, ","Environmental Modelling & Software, Volume 92, June 2017, Pages 152-162, ","Ensemble forecasting is becoming increasingly popular as a hydrological forecasting tool because of its advantages of not only predicting the most likely outcome of a hydrological event, but also providing related uncertainty information. Rank histogram is one of the most widely used metrics for verifying the reliability of ensemble forecasts. This study proposed an improved rank histogram method, the Rank Polar Diagram (Rpolar diagram), for evaluating the reliability of ensemble forecasts of extreme events. The conventional rank histogram provided a simple evaluation of the reliability of an ensemble forecast, which could not differentiate the reliability of the forecasts of extreme events such as heavy storms, high flows and low flows. Rpolar diagrams were able to verify not only the overall reliability but also the partial reliability over different flow intervals, including extremes. In Rpolar diagram, forecast intervals could be set according to user preference or uniform intervals automatically. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Rpolar diagram using two typical sets of simulation ensembles and actual streamflow/precipitation ensembles. Both streamflow and precipitation application results exhibited the suitability of the Rpolar diagrams for verifying the reliability of extreme events."
Interactive story authoring: A viable form of creative expression for the classroom,"Mike Carbonaro, Maria Cutumisu, Harvey Duff, Stephanie Gillis, Kevin Waugh, ","Computers & Education, Volume 51, Issue 2, September 2008, Pages 687-707, ","The unprecedented growth in numbers of children playing computer games has stimulated discussion and research regarding what, if any, educational value these games have for teaching and learning. The research on this topic has primarily focused on children as players of computer games rather than builders/constructors of computer games. Recently, several game companies, such as BioWare Corp. and Bethesda Softworks, have released game story creation tools to the public, along with their games. However, a major obstacle to using these commercial tools is the level of programming experience required to create interactive game stories. In this paper, we demonstrate that a commercial game story construction tool, BioWare Corp.＊s Aurora Toolset, can be augmented by our new tool, ScriptEase, to enable students in two grade ten English classes to successfully construct interactive game stories. We present evidence that describes the relationship between interactive story authoring and traditional story authoring, along with a series of factors that can potentially affect success at these activities: gender, creativity, intellectual ability, previous experiences with programming, time playing computer games, and time spent online. Results indicate that students can successfully construct sophisticated interactive stories with very little training. The results also show no gender differences in the quality of these interactive stories, regardless of programming experience or the amount of time per week playing computer games or participating in general online activities, although a subset of female students did show a slightly higher level of performance on interactive story authoring. In the educational context of this study, we show that ScriptEase provides an easy-to-use tool for interactive story authoring in a constructionist learning environment."
RankCNN: When learning to rank encounters the pseudo preference feedback,"Yuan Dong, Chong Huang, Wei Liu, ","Computer Standards & Interfaces, Volume 36, Issue 3, March 2014, Pages 554-562, ","Learning to rank has received great attentions in the field of text retrieval for several years. However, a few researchers introduce the topic into visual reranking due to the special nature of image presentation. In this paper, a novel unsupervised visual reranking is proposed, termed rank via the convolutional neural networks (RankCNN). This approach integrates deep learning with pseudo preference feedback. The optimal set of pseudo preference pairs is first detected from initial list by a modified graph-based method. Ranking is then reduced to pairwise classification in the architecture of CNN. In addition, Accelerated Mini-Batch Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (ASDCA) is introduced to the framework to accelerate the training. The experiments indicate the competitive performance on the LETOR 4.0, the Paris and the Francelandmark dataset."
Sensor technology for smart homes,"Dan Ding, Rory A. Cooper, Paul F. Pasquina, Lavinia Fici-Pasquina, ","Maturitas, Volume 69, Issue 2, June 2011, Pages 131-136, ","A smart home is a residence equipped with technology that observes the residents and provides proactive services. Most recently, it has been introduced as a potential solution to support independent living of people with disabilities and older adults, as well as to relieve the workload from family caregivers and health providers. One of the key supporting features of a smart home is its ability to monitor the activities of daily living and safety of residents, and in detecting changes in their daily routines. With the availability of inexpensive low-power sensors, radios, and embedded processors, current smart homes are typically equipped with a large amount of networked sensors which collaboratively process and make deductions from the acquired data on the state of the home as well as the activities and behaviors of its residents. This article reviews sensor technology used in smart homes with a focus on direct environment sensing and infrastructure mediated sensing. The article also points out the strengths and limitations of different sensor technologies, as well as discusses challenges and opportunities from clinical, technical, and ethical perspectives. It is recommended that sensor technologies for smart homes address actual needs of all stake holders including end users, their family members and caregivers, and their doctors and therapists. More evidence on the appropriateness, usefulness, and cost benefits analysis of sensor technologies for smart homes is necessary before these sensors should be widely deployed into real-world residential settings and successfully integrated into everyday life and health care services."

Poly 汐-lysine and poly (污-glutamic acid) were deposited alternately onto the surface of an electrospun poly 汍-caprolactone matrix via electrostatic layer-by-layer self-assembly, and then selenocystamine was loaded as a catalyst. Measurement of in vitro catalytic generation of nitric oxide demonstrated that this catalyst-loaded material could considerably accelerate the release of nitric oxide from S-nitrosoglutathione. A fibroblast proliferation assay showed that the material possessed satisfactory cellular compatibility. The catalyst-loaded material could inhibit the spread of smooth muscle cells in the presence of nitric oxide donors. In arteriovenous-shunt experiment, the catalyst-loaded graft exhibited good anti-thrombotic property where it could prevent acute thrombosis by decreasing the adhesion and activation of platelets and other blood cells.

Current undergraduate examination methods robustly assess up to 5 of these 8 required skills. This study sought to evaluate an alternative certification examination (※ACE§) in assessing all of the 8 required domains in surgical cases.A total of 143 final-year medical students were invited to participate in an ※ACE§ in February 2013. In total, 137 students, 95.8% of the class, agreed to participate. The ※ACE§ format consisted of 4 sequential patient encounters observed by 2 independent examiners. It assessed all the 8 required domains of professional practice. The examiners and the students evaluated this examination format using a Likert scale and free-text comments.The ※ACE§ assessed all the 8 domains. The inclusion of a patient safety measure to avoid an egregious error in the pass criteria resulted in 27 (18.9%) students failing to meet them. The correlation of grades between the independent examiners in the ※ACE§ was strong at a Cronbach 汐 of 0.907 (CI: 0.766每1). The ※ACE§ format was reported as an acceptable examination methodology by the examiners for formative or summative assessment of surgical cases at the end of a primary medical degree.The ※ACE§ format is standardized, is integrative, and has excellent interrater reliability. Inclusion of a patient safety measure as pass criteria appears to increase specificity. The ※ACE§ shows potential as an alternative examination to the traditional long case examination and objective structured clinical examination in assessing all the 8 domains of professional practice."
Viable Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis isolated from calf milk replacer,"Irene R. Grant, Antonio C. G. Foddai, James C. Tarrant, Brenna Kunkel, Michael T. Collins, ","Journal of Dairy Science, Volume 100, Issue 12, December 2017, Pages 9723-9735, ","When advising farmers on how to control Johne's disease in an infected herd, one of the main recommendations is to avoid feeding waste milk to calves and instead feed calf milk replacer (CMR). This advice is based on the assumption that CMR is free of viable Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) cells, an assumption that has not previously been challenged. We tested commercial CMR products (n = 83) obtained from dairy farms around the United States by the peptide-mediated magnetic separation (PMS)-phage assay, PMS followed by liquid culture (PMS-culture), and direct IS900 quantitative PCR (qPCR). Conventional microbiological analyses for total mesophilic bacterial counts, coliforms, Salmonella, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, nonhemolytic Corynebacterium spp., and Bacillus spp. were also performed to assess the overall microbiological quality of the CMR. Twenty-six (31.3%) of the 83 CMR samples showed evidence of the presence of MAP. Seventeen (20.5%) tested positive for viable MAP by the PMS-phage assay, with plaque counts ranging from 6 to 1,212 pfu/50 mL of reconstituted CMR (average 248.5 pfu/50 mL). Twelve (14.5%) CMR samples tested positive for viable MAP by PMS-culture; isolates from all 12 of these samples were subsequently confirmed by whole-genome sequencing to be different cattle strains of MAP. Seven (8.4%) CMR samples tested positive for MAP DNA by IS900 qPCR. Four CMR samples tested positive by both PMS-based tests and 5 CMR samples tested positive by IS900 qPCR plus one or other of the PMS-based tests, but only one CMR sample tested positive by all 3 MAP detection tests applied. All conventional microbiology results were within current standards for whole milk powders. A significant association existed between higher total bacterial counts and presence of viable MAP indicated by either of the PMS-based assays. This represents the first published report of the isolation of viable MAP from CMR. Our findings raise concerns about the potential ability of MAP to survive manufacture of dried milk-based products."

Simulating land-use decisions in the La Amistad Biosphere Reserve buffer zone in Costa Rica and Panama,"Sheila Bliss Duffy, Michael S Corson, W. E Grant, ","Ecological Modelling, Volume 140, Issues 1每2, 30 May 2001, Pages 9-29, ","Human demand for agricultural products leads to land degradation, deforestation, habitat destruction, and loss of biodiversity. Effective management of land for both agricultural and conservation purposes remains central to sustainable development efforts. We describe development of a preliminary model that integrates ecological, economic, and social factors affecting land-use decisions in the buffer zone of the La Amistad Biosphere Reserve in Costa Rica and Panama. The model simulates potential shifts in the distribution of land among six alternative uses and the resulting impacts on the finances of rural families living within the buffer zone over the next decade. The output of interest is changes in land use as measured by the number of hectares in each of the six land-use classes. In baseline simulations, farmers tended to convert land, particularly forested hectares, into agricultural land uses. Sensitivity analysis showed that model results appeared more sensitive to economic and social factors than they did to ecological factors. Given the relatively short 10-year simulations, changes in topsoil-loss rates had no effect on final land-use distributions. Of four management strategies simulated, decreasing production costs by 25% yielded the largest final amount of cash on hand after 10 years. Generally, increasing tourism profit by 50% yielded the next-highest financial benefits, followed by increasing conservation subsidy by 50% and decreasing annual interest rate by 50%. We consider the primary contribution of the present model to be examination, at the individual farm level, of the relative influence of ecological, economic, and social factors on land-use decisions and distribution. Ideally, such studies will have the potential to influence management interventions that enable buffer zone farmers to achieve financial security and, as a by-product, balance land-use distribution in buffer-zone agroecosystems, which may help to maintain biodiversity."

Therefore, this study investigated PAK1, PAK2, and p-PAK2 Ser20 in the pathogenesis of GTD. By real-time PCR, PAK1 mRNA was significantly higher in HMs, particularly metastatic HMs (P = 0.046) and HMs that developed persistent disease (P = 0.011), when compared with normal placentas. By immunohistochemistry, significantly increased cytoplasmic PAK1 immunoreactivity in cytotrophoblasts was also detected in HMs (P = 0.042) and choriocarcinomas (P = 0.003). In addition, HMs that developed persistent disease displayed higher PAK1 immunoreactivity than those that regressed (P = 0.016), and elevated PAK1 immunoreactivity was observed in placental site trophoblastic tumors. Indeed, there was significant positive correlation between PAK1 expression and the proliferative indices Ki-67 (P = 0.016) and MCM7 (P = 0.026). Moreover, higher PAK1 mRNA and protein expression was confirmed in the choriocarcinoma cell-lines JEG-3 and JAR; however, PAK2 mRNA and p-PAK2 immunoreactivity showed a similar expression pattern in normal first trimester placentas and GTD. Knockdown of PAK1 in JEG-3 and JAR reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion ability, up-regulated p16, and down-regulated vascular endothelial growth factor and MT1-MMP expression. This is the first report revealing the involvement of PAK1 in the pathogenesis and clinical progress of GTD."

We aim to determine the symptoms and prevalence of SDB in a university student population using a questionnaire survey followed by home sleep monitoring.The Sleep and Health Questionnaire (a modified version of the Specialized Centers of Research Sleep Questionnaire, translated into Chinese) was distributed to all first-year students (1,306 male and 1,757 female) enrolled in the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Subsequently, those students who returned the questionnaires were randomly chosen to undergo portable home sleep monitoring using the MESAM IV device (Madaus Medizin-Elektronik; Freiburg, Germany).A total of 1,910 replies were obtained from 3,063 questionnaires sent by mail (response rate, 62.4%). The female to male ratio was 1.8:1, with mean age of 19.4 years (SD, 1.3 years) and mean body mass index (BMI) of 20.0 (SD, 2.5). Overall, 25.7% of subjects reported snoring; 10.7% and 42.1% reported impaired performance ability and daytime sleepiness, respectively. Of the 88 subjects who underwent overnight sleep monitoring, 66 subjects (75%) were snorers and 8 subjects (9%) snored > 10% of the night. Male subjects had a higher BMI (p < 0.001) and tended to snore more often than female subjects (p = 0.06). Subjects with an oxygen desaturation index (ODI) ≡ 3 had a BMI > 22 (p < 0.05). On sleep study, nine subjects (10.2%) and two subjects (2.3%) had a respiratory disturbance index (RDI) ≡ 3 and an RDI ≡ 5, respectively, associated with self-reported sleepiness, giving a minimum estimated prevalence of SDB as 0.1% (RDI ≡ 5) in the study population. There was no correlation between recorded snoring with either RDI or self-reported sleepiness. Questionnaire responses, neck circumference, and alcohol consumption did not predict the occurrence of SDB.Snoring was prevalent, while SDB was uncommon in this student population. However, snoring and self-reported symptoms by questionnaire were poor predictors for SDB. Male gender showed a trend as an independent predictor for snoring, but not for SDB."

Prediction of vapor每liquid equilibria for mixtures of low boiling point compounds using Wong每Sandler mixing rule and EOS/GE model,"Reza Espanani, Andrew Miller, William Jacoby, ","Chemical Engineering Science, Volume 152, 2 October 2016, Pages 343-350, ","Vapor每liquid equilibrium (VLE) of low boiling point components occurs at low-temperature and usually at high pressure. A proper method for computing the fugacity coefficient is to use a cubic equation of state with mixing rules. However, empirical mixing rules include one adjustable parameter and cannot predict VLE of some mixtures accurately. An alternative that could be used for non-ideal mixtures is the Wong每Sandler mixing rule, which is derived based on the excess Gibbs energy (GE). In this research, VLE of light gaseous mixtures was calculated at low temperatures and medium to high pressures using the Peng每Robinson equation of state (PR EOS), the Wong每Sandler mixing rule, and the NRTL equation as a GE model. This introduces an additional adjustable parameter. Assuming the adjustable parameters as a function of temperature, the results show that this thermodynamic model is an appropriate method to predict VLE of low boiling point materials at wide range of temperatures."
A hybrid elastic metamaterial with negative mass density and tunable bending stiffness,"Yangyang Chen, Gengkai Hu, Guoliang Huang, ","Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, Volume 105, August 2017, Pages 179-198, ","Achieving vibration and/or wave attenuation with locally resonant metamaterials has attracted a great deal of attention due to their frequency dependent negative effective mass density. Moreover, adaptive phononic crystals with shunted piezoelectric patches have also demonstrated a tunable wave attenuation mechanism by controlling electric circuits to achieve a negative effective stiffness. In this paper, we propose an adaptive hybrid metamaterial that possesses both a negative mass density as well as an extremely tunable stiffness by properly utilizing both the mechanical and electric elements. A multi-physical analytical model is first developed to investigate and reveal the tunable wave manipulation abilities in terms of both the effective negative mass density and/or bending stiffness of the hybrid metamaterial. The programmed flexural wave manipulations, broadband negative refraction and waveguiding are then illustrated through three-dimensional (3D) multi-physical numerical simulations in hybrid metamaterial plates.

"Myocardial perfusion, function and exercise tolerance after the arterial switch operation","Steven N. Weindling, Gil Wernovsky, Steven D. Colan, J. Anthony Parker, S. Ted Treves, ","Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Volume 23, Issue 2, February 1994, Pages 424-433, ","Objectives. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of myocardial perfusion abnormalities at rest and exercise and to assess exercise capacity in children after the arterial switch operation.Background. There have been sporadic reports of myocardial ischemia or sudden death in children after the arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries, possibly related to inadequate coronary perfusion due to kinking or stenosis of the translocated coronary arteries.Methods. Myocardial perfusion at rest and peak exercise was assessed using the scintigraphic agent technetium-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (sestamibi). Exercise capacity was determined with a modified Brace protocol. Ambulatory etectrocardiographic (ECG) Holter monitoring was performed. Ventricular function, contractility and wall motion were assessed echocardiographically.Results. Twenty-three children (aged 4.2 to 7.9 years) underwent evaluation. Abnormalities were found on the rest perfusion scans in 22 children (95.6%). The left ventricular myocardium was divided into 13 segments for analysis. Of 299 rest segments, 225 (75.3%) were normal, 11 (3.7%) showed mild defects, 45 (15%) moderate defects and 18 (6%) severe defects at rest. At peak exercise, 237 segments (79.3%) were normal, 24 (8%) showed mild defects, 33 (11%) moderate defects and 5 (1.7%) severe defects. Compared with rest studies, myocardial perfusion grade at exercise was unchanged in 246 segments (82.3%), improved in 42 (14%) and worsened in 11 (3.7%). All patients had normal exercise tolerance without symptoms or ischemic ECG changes. No ventricular tachycardia was seen on Holter monitoring. All patients had a shortening fraction ≡27%. Left ventricular contractility was normal in 12 children in whom it was assessed. Regional wall motion was normal in 17 children with adequate echocardiographic images for this analysis.Conclusions. Myocardial perfusion scan abnormalities assessed by technetium-99m sestamibi are common after an arterial switch operation. These abnormalities are of uncertain clinical significance and generally lessen with exercise. The normal exercise tolerance without symptoms or ECG changes suggests that myocardial perfusion is adequate during the physiologic stress of exercise in children up to 8 years after an arterial switch operation."
Estimation and inference of dynamic structural factor models with over-identifying restrictions,"Xu Han, ","Journal of Econometrics, Volume 202, Issue 2, February 2018, Pages 125-147, ",This paper develops a new estimator for the impulse response functions in structural factor models with a fixed number of over-identifying restrictions. The proposed identification scheme nests the conventional just-identified recursive scheme as a special case. We establish the asymptotic distributions of the new estimator and develop test statistics for the over-identifying restrictions. Simulation results show that adding a few more over-identifying restrictions can lead to a substantial improvement in estimation accuracy for impulse response functions at both zero and nonzero horizons. We estimate the effects of a monetary policy shock using a U.S. data set. The results show that our over-identified scheme can help to detect incorrect specifications that lead to spurious impulse responses.

This study was performed mainly before the availability of combination antiretroviral therapy.The main histologic subtypes were centroblastic lymphoma in 131 patients (45%), immunoblastic lymphoma in 39 patients (13%), and Burkitt＊s lymphoma (including the classical form and the variant with plasmacytic differentiation) in 115 patients (40%). Burkitt＊s lymphoma was the most aggressive form, whereas immunoblastic lymphoma occurred in severely immunodeficient patients. Two-year survival after enrollment was 15% in immunoblastic lymphoma, 32% in Burkitt＊s lymphoma, and 31% in centroblastic lymphoma (P = 0.006), but multivariate analysis did not confirm the independent prognostic value of histologic subtype. Instead, five independent pretreatment factors increased the risk of mortality: age 40 years or older [relative risk (RR) = 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.005], elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level (RR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.02), having a diagnosis of AIDS before lymphoma (RR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.6; P = 0.006), CD4+ cell count less than 100 ℅ 106/L (RR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.6; P = 0.0004), and impaired performance status (RR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7 to 3.4; P <0.0001).Several pretreatment characteristics of HIV-related lymphoma were linked to the histologic form, but HIV disease parameters other than those of lymphoma were the main determinants of outcome, so the histologic features of the lymphoma were not associated with prognosis."

Direct observation of deformation twinning under stress gradient in body-centered cubic metals,"Binbin Jiang, Aidong Tu, Hao Wang, Huichao Duan, Kui Du, ","Acta Materialia, Volume 155, 15 August 2018, Pages 56-68, ","In body-centered cubic (BCC) metals, plastic deformation usually takes place by deformation twinning under high strain rate. Although numerous efforts have been conducted on deformation twinning, the twinning mechanism is still shrouded in mystery. Here, we report a direct observation of deformation twinning in BCC tantalum and niobium by the use of in situ and aberration-corrected electron microscopy. Twin lamellae grow up from coherent twin boundaries by repeatedly extruding and subsequently expanding of bulges on the twin boundaries. A substantial stress gradient is detected around twin lamellae along the twinning direction. The twin growth can be described by a self-thickening mechanism through dislocation reactions at steps on coherent twin boundaries thus absent continuous supply of dislocations. The dislocation reactions can be activated and deactivated by the transition between normal step dislocations and complementary zonal dislocations. These results provide insights to deformation twinning in bulk BCC metals.Download high-res image (325KB)Download full-size image"
"Coal-ball floras of Maritime Canada and palynology of the Foord seam: geologic, paleobotanical and paleoecological implications","Paul C. Lyons, Erwin L. Zodrow, Michael A. Millay, Graham Dolby, Aureal T. Cross, ","Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology, Volume 95, Issues 1每4, January 1997, Pages 31-50, ","Coal balls in the Canadian Carboniferous System are known from the Clifton Formation (late Bolsovian) of New Brunswick and from the Foord seam (Stellarton Formation, late Bolsovian) of the Stellarton Basin of Nova Scotia. Coal balls from these two units are dominated by arborescent lycopods but ferns, seed ferns, calamiteans, and cordaiteans also occur. Baxter's list (Baxter, 1960) of coal-ball plants from New Brunswick is updated and these fossil plants are illustrated here for the first time on the basis of an examination of his peels.The palynomorphs and coal-ball plants of the Foord seam of the Stellarton Basin are illustrated and their paleoecology is discussed. Five genera of arborescent lycopods were present in the Foord swamp: Diaphorodendron, Paralycopodites, Lepidophloios, Sigillaria and Lepidodendron. The first three genera are represented in coal balls; the second two are also represented as compressions in the Foord seam; and all genera are represented in the spore assemblages from the Foord seam. The palynostratigraphy indicates that Sigillaria and Diaphorodendron were almost exclusively confined to the upper bench, whereas the other three genera were probably present in the Foord mire throughout its entire history. Palynomorphic changes in the Foord mire probably reflect gradual changes in wet and dry conditions."

Neonatal oncology: Diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas,"Sheila Weitzman, Ronald Grant, ","Seminars in Perinatology, Volume 21, Issue 1, February 1997, Pages 102-111, ","Tumors are a rare but important cause of mortality and morbidity in the neonate. There is a wide spectrum of benign and malignant tumors that can occur, some of which have a unique presentation and behavior in this age group. It is important to recognize that tumors such as stage IVS neuroblastoma, which have a good prognosis in older children, may be rapidly fatal in the newborn and constitute an oncological emergency. Other tumors behave in a less aggressive fashion at this age than in the older child, and should not be overtreated. An increasing number of tumors are being detected by prenatal screening, and understanding of their natural history and management is important. Management of neonatal cancer requires knowledge also of the developmental biology of the neonate, of the way in which they handle drugs, and the increased potential for acute toxicity and long-term morbidity from chemotherapy and radiation therapy."
Cyclin D1 Gene G870A Polymorphism Predicts Response to Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy and Prognosis in Rectal Cancer,"Alexandre Ho-Pun-Cheung, Eric Assenat, Simon Thezenas, Fr谷d谷ric Bibeau, Evelyne Lopez-Crapez, ","International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics, Volume 68, Issue 4, 15 July 2007, Pages 1094-1101, ","Purpose: To investigate whether CCND1 genetic variations associated with a constitutive nuclear protein may influence either the pathologic response to preoperative RT or the prognosis in a series of rectal cancer patients.Methods and Materials: Seventy rectal cancer patients treated by neoadjuvant radiotherapy were included in the study. CCND1 exon 5 mutations were screened, and the G870A polymorphism was assessed for correlation with clinical variables, tumor response, and patient outcome.Results: No exon 5 mutation was found. Concerning the G870A polymorphism, the A/A variant was significantly associated with radiosensitivity (p = 0.022). Moreover, patients harboring the A allele were correlated with a lower risk of local failure (p = 0.017). Also, combination of the G870A polymorphism with the post-therapeutic lymph node status allowed the elaboration of a prognostic index, which accurately distinguished subgroups of patients with predictable recurrence-free (p = 0.003) and overall (p = 0.044) survival.Conclusions: Although CCND1 exon 5 mutations are rare in rectal cancer, G870A polymorphism is a frequent variation that may predict radiosensitivity and prognosis."
Validation of an appropriate reference gene for normalization of reverse transcription每quantitative polymerase chain reaction data from rectal cancer biopsies,"Alexandre Ho-Pun-Cheung, Caroline Bascoul-Mollevi, Eric Assenat, Fr谷d谷ric Bibeau, Evelyne Lopez-Crapez, ","Analytical Biochemistry, Volume 388, Issue 2, 15 May 2009, Pages 348-350, ","Gene expression quantification using reverse transcription每quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT每qPCR) requires data normalization using an invariable reference gene. Here we assessed the stability of 15 housekeeping genes in 31 tumor and normal rectal samples to validate a reliable reference gene for rectal cancer studies. Our data show that 18S and 28S RNA are stably expressed in all samples. Moreover, when used for normalization, 18S, but not 28S, greatly reduced unspecific variations of gene expression due to RNA degradation. These results demonstrate that 18S is an appropriate reference gene for normalization of RT每qPCR data from rectal cancer samples."
Cytokine Gene Expression Profile of Circulating CD4+ T Cells in Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis,"Christopher K. W. Lai, Sheng Ho, Christopher H. S. Chan, Joseph Chan, Kar-neng Lai, ","Chest, Volume 111, Issue 3, March 1997, Pages 606-611, ","T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ cells, are thought to play an important role in the immune defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis through the release of their wide array of cytokines. In vitro studies suggest that Mycobacterium-specific T-cell clones are of the TH1 subtype. Using the technique of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we have investigated the capacity for cytokine gene expression profile in ex vivo circulating CD4+ T cells from 20 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared with that of 30 normal healthy tuberculin-positive volunteers. Venous blood samples were collected from the former prior to the initiation of chemotherapy. A significant increase in interleukin (IL-2) expression (p< 0.001) and a significant decrease in IL-5 expression (p<0.0001) were observed in patients with tuberculosis but no differences were seen in the expression of IL-4 and interferon gamma between the two study groups. Our data support a TH1-like immune response in active tuberculosis."
Emergence of statistical scaling in floods on channel networks from complex runoff dynamics,"Vijay K. Gupta, ","Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, Volume 19, Issue 2, January 2004, Pages 357-365, ","The physical processes governing floods in river basins are highly variable in space and time. Spatial variability produces a very large number of values of the parameters governing production of runoff from hills and its transport through channels. Most of these parameters cannot be measured, and the number of different values that they can take increases with spatial scale. By contrast the aggregated behavior of peak flows exhibits statistical scale invariance at successively larger spatial scales. Statistical scaling is an emergent property of a complex physical system, which is not built into the physical equations. The slopes and the intercepts of log每log linear relationships describing scale invariance are called ＆scaling parameters＊, which can be estimated empirically. Scaling theory provides a new mathematical framework for interpreting empirical scaling parameters in terms of numerical and analytical solutions of physical equations and thereby testing different hypotheses. We illustrate this central idea using three flood-scaling parameters that have been estimated from two experimental basins in the United States, Walnut Gulch, AZ, and Goodwin Creek, MS. Scaling theory unifies spatial scaling flood statistics with physical processes, which has been a long-standing, fundamental open hydrology problem. The scaling framework provides the scientific foundations for solving the global problem of prediction of floods from ungauged and poorly gauged basins."
Polyaniline-based nanocomposite materials for hydrogen storage,"Michael Ulrich Jurczyk, Ashok Kumar, Sesha Srinivasan, Elias Stefanakos, ","International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, Volume 32, Issue 8, June 2007, Pages 1010-1015, ","Nanomaterials have diverse tunable physical properties as a function of their size and shape due to strong quantum confinement effect and large surface to volume ratio. On basis of these facts, nanocomposite materials can be considered as strong candidates for hydrogen storage. In the present work, we report a novel conducting polymeric nanocomposite material for hydrogen storage. Conducting polymer-based nanocomposites were modified using carbon nanotubes as filler material. This further increased the porous structure of the nanocomposite and the number of binding sites, which in turn enhances the hydrogen storage capacity. Additionally, fine aluminum powder was added to the polymeric nanocomposite, which further increased the hydrogen sorption of the material. The modified conducting polymeric nanocomposites were characterized with various analytical techniques including FTIR, DSC, TGA and SEM. Adsorption and desorption experiments are conducted using a Sieverts-type volumetric PCT instrument. Further experiments are in progress to understand the hydrogen storage mechanism in the proposed conducting polymer nanocomposites."

This paper reviews the broader definition of necrotizing infections, including infective myositis. The symptoms, signs and laboratory-based diagnostic tools are discussed. Early diagnosis of NSTI is often a challenge due to inconsistent features of necrosis at presentation; however, features of necrosis can also develop within hours. Clear risk factors and patterns of bacteriology exist, some of which define prognosis. Modern concepts, including debridement zones and an operative strategy are discussed. Time to debridement significantly impacts mortality outcomes and is a key message of this article."
Virtual Fusion: State of the Art in Component Simulation/Emulation for Manufacturing,"William S. Harrison, Frederick Proctor, ","Procedia Manufacturing, Volume 1, 2015, Pages 110-121, ","Simulation is an indispensable part of design and analysis in a near infinite space of applications. Every day, simulation is applied to new problems as well as giving further insight into existing ones. Additionally, advancements in computing have enabled simulation to continue contributing understanding in areas where it is already a ubiquitous tool. Manufacturing in particular has benefited a great deal from simulation techniques ranging from Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for product design, to Discrete Event Simulations (DES) for process planning. In recent times emulation has emerged as an effective means of process validation. Emulation typically refers to a testing process where the controllers or control code are in their final state, while the components they control are still virtual. Virtual Fusion takes this one step further in creating a Hybrid Process Simulation (HPS), where any component of the process may be physically present or completely simulated. This paper first defines and then discusses the characteristics necessary for the component simulations needed in an HPS. It then follows with a technological survey, a literature review of existing tools, and concludes with research challenges."

Nguyen, ","Plant Science, Volume 240, November 2015, Pages 65-78, ","Drought stress causes significant yield losses in major oil seed crops, such as soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr]. Few soybean lines have been identified as canopy-wilting tolerant; however, the molecular mechanism conferring tolerance is not fully understood. To understand the biological process, a whole genome transcriptome analysis was performed for leaf tissues of two contrasting soybean lines: drought-susceptible (DS) Pana and drought-tolerant (DT) PI 567690. A pairwise comparison of the DS and DT lines under drought and control conditions detected 1914 and 670 genes with a greater than two-fold change in expression under drought conditions. Pairwise treatment comparison and gene enrichment analysis on the DT line showed the down-regulation of genes associated with protein binding, hydrolase activity, carbohydrate/lipid metabolism, xyloglucan endo-transglycosylases associated with cell-wall, apoplast, and chlorophyll a/b binding proteins. On the other hand, genes that were associated with the biotic stress response, ion binding and transport, the oxido-reductive process and electron carrier activity were up-regulated. Gene enrichment analysis detected UDP glucuronosyl transferase activity-encoding genes to be differentially expressed in PI 567690 under drought stress conditions. We found valuable SNPs variation in aquaporin genes of the DT line that are conserved in known slower canopy-wilting lines, this should facilitate marker-assisted selection in soybeans with improved drought tolerance."

Studies were included if they provided original qualitative or quantitative data on staff perceptions of tele-ICU coverage. Studies were imported into content analysis software and coded by tele-ICU configuration, methodology, participants, and findings (eg, positive and negative staff evaluations).Review of 3,086 citations yielded 23 eligible studies. Findings were grouped into four categories of staff evaluation: overall acceptance level of tele-ICU coverage (measured in 70% of studies), impact on patient care (measured in 96%), impact on staff (measured in 100%), and organizational impact (measured in 48%). Overall acceptance was high, despite initial ambivalence. Favorable impact on patient care was perceived by > 82% of participants. Staff impact referenced enhanced collaboration, autonomy, and training, although scrutiny, malfunctions, and contradictory advice were cited as potential barriers. Staff perceived the organizational impact to vary. An important limitation of available studies was a lack of rigorous methodology and validated survey instruments in many studies.Initial reports suggest high levels of staff acceptance of tele-ICU coverage, but more rigorous methodologic study is required."
Effects of CO2-driven sediment acidification on infaunal marine bivalves: A synthesis,"Jeff C. Clements, Heather L. Hunt, ","Marine Pollution Bulletin, Volume 117, Issues 1每2, 15 April 2017, Pages 6-16, ","While ocean acidification (OA) effects on marine organisms are well documented, impacts of sediment acidification on infaunal organisms are relatively understudied. Here we synthesize CO2-driven sediment acidification effects on infaunal marine bivalves. While sediment carbonate system conditions can already exceed near-future OA projections, sediments can become even more acidic as overlying seawater pH decreases. Evidence suggests that infaunal bivalves experience shell dissolution, more lesions, and increased mortality in more acidic sediments; effects on heavy metal accumulation appear complex and uncertain. Infaunal bivalves can avoid negative functional consequences of sediment acidification by reducing burrowing and increasing dispersal in more acidic sediments, irrespective of species or life stage; elevated temperature may compromise this avoidance behaviour. The combined effects of sediment acidification and other environmental stressors are virtually unknown. While it is evident that sediment acidification can impact infaunal marine bivalves, more research is needed to confidently predict effects under future ocean conditions."

Disease relevance of T11TS-induced T-cell signal transduction through the CD2-mediated calcineurin每NFAT pathway: Perspectives in glioma immunotherapy,"Suhnrita Chaudhuri, Debanjan Bhattacharya, Manoj Kumar Singh, Saibal Moitra, Swapna Chaudhuri, ","Molecular Immunology, Volume 67, Issue 2, Part B, October 2015, Pages 256-264, ","Malignant glioma is the most lethal of a wide array of CNS neoplasms. Its onset and progression are markedly associated with profound immunosupression and paralysis of T-cell survival and proliferation. Myriad immunotherapeutic strategies are presently used to target such T-cell anomalies in glioma. Our recent work has highlighted use of the novel glycopeptide, the CD2 ligand, T11 target structure (T11TS) as an immunotherapeutic agent against experimentally induced glioma in rats. We have shown that T11TS causes multi-target modulation of key components of the T-cell 每 antigen presenting cell (APC) immunological synapse. This consequently triggers T-cell activation so as to reverse glioma-induced changes to physiological levels. T11TS administration also causes CD2 upregulation. Earlier we also found T11TS to cause enhanced proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in glioma conditions. These findings led us to believe that downstream CD2-stimulated ※alternative pathway§ of calcineurin每NFAT could be a possible target for modulation by T11TS. In the present paper we thus show that immunotherapy with T11TS induces a multi-targeted approach towards activation of this ※alternative pathway§ of T-cell signaling providing an immunotherapeutic advantage against glioma. We show here that T11TS immunotherapy causes positive modulations of the CD2 pathway-associated proteins, viz., p59fyn, protein kinase C-牟 (PKC-牟), calcineurin and nuclear factor for activation of T-cells (NFAT) and hint that this may accord greater survival and proliferation advantage to T-cells of the glioma-bearing animals for augmented defence against glioma. These findings help open a molecular immunotherapeutic door 每 one which is directed towards clinical studies for glioma-immunotherapy using T11TS."
Mechanical and actuation behavior of electroactive nanostructured polymers,"Ravi Shankar, Tushar K. Ghosh, Richard J. Spontak, ","Sensors and Actuators A: Physical, Volume 151, Issue 1, 8 April 2009, Pages 46-52, ","Electroactive polymers (EAPs) can exhibit relatively large actuation strain responses upon electrical stimulation. For this reason, in conjunction with their light weight, robust properties, low cost and facile processability, EAPs are of considerable interest in the development of next-generation organic actuators. Within this class of materials, dielectric electroactive polymers (D-EAPs) have repeatedly exhibited the most promising and versatile properties. A new family of D-EAPs derived from swollen poly[styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-styrene] triblock copolymers has been recently found to undergo ultrahigh displacement at relatively low electric fields compared to previously reported D-EAPs. The present work examines the mechanical and actuation response of these electroactive nanostructured polymer (ENP) systems under quasi-static, and electromechanical loading conditions. Careful measurement of the quasi-static properties under tensile and compressive loading yield similar results that are significantly influenced by the introduction of in-plane strain, as well as by copolymer concentration or molecular weight. Blocking stress measurements reveal that the actuation effectiveness achieved by some of the ENPs is comparable to that of the VHB 4910 acrylic D-EAP, thus providing a novel and efficient avenue to designer D-EAPs for advanced engineering, biomimetic and biomedical applications."
Utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT in identifying penile squamous cell carcinoma metastatic lymph nodes,"Henry M. Rosevear, Hadyn Williams, Matthew Collins, Andrew J. Lightfoot, James A. Brown, ","Urologic Oncology: Seminars and Original Investigations, Volume 30, Issue 5, September每October 2012, Pages 723-726, ","Due to the significant potential morbidity of inguinal and pelvic lymphadenectomy, the search for an imaging modality that can accurately identify penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) lymphatic metastases continues. Initial 18F-FDG PET/CT studies have reported 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the detection of inguinal and obturator lymph node metastasis. We review a single institutional experience of 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging of SCCA of the penis to assess for accuracy and potential impact on clinical management.Three patients diagnosed with penile SCCA at a single institution underwent staging 18F-FDG PET/CT and went on to subsequent inguinal lymph node dissection. The 18F-FDG PET machine was a Philips Gemini Time-of-Flight PET with LYSO crystals with 4.7 mm spatial resolution. The CT was a 16-slice helical CT with 5 mm slice widths. 18F-FDG PET/CT findings were compared with the histologic findings of these procedures. Decision to proceed with lymphadenectomy was based on clinical judgment of a single urologist and all fused 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging was assessed by a single experienced radiologist.No patient received chemotherapy or radiation before the 18F-FDG PET/CT or surgery. The first patient was obese (BMI > 30), clinically node negative, and the 18F-FDG PET/CT showed inflammation. Histologic examination showed a positive 2 cm right inguinal metastatic node. The second patient's 18F-FDG PET/CT showed a suspicious 1 cm left inguinal node. Histologically, the suspicious lymph node was positive for SCCA as was a second positive 2 cm lymph node not identified on preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT. Clinical exam of this patient was negative. The third patient was 18F-FDG PET/CT and clinically negative but subsequently developed a palpable lymph node approximately 1 month later, which was suspicious on repeat 18F-FDG PET/CT and positive for SCCA on histological examination.18F-FDG PET/CT has shown initial promise in the staging of penile SCCA. However, our review shows that false negative studies occur at alarmingly high rates, and 18F-FDG PET/CT is poor in detection of micro-metastasis. Thus, close follow-up in these patients is imperative."

Tympanometry provides objective information on middle ear status, and findings obtained from this procedure have often served as a criterion for medical referral. Objective: To extend previous research and to facilitate use of normative tympanometry measures obtained from children with native Hawaiian ancestry. Methods: Data were collected from 718 ears of 359 children in academic levels ranging from preschool to third grade. Subjects were matched across groups (182 native Hawaiian; 177 non-native Hawaiian) for academic level and gender. Variables included physical ear-canal volume (Vec), tympanometric peak compliance (peak Y, also known as static admittance), tympanometric width (TW), and tympanometric peak pressure (TPP). Results: Significantly higher TW (F1,714=8.82, P=0.008) and TPP (F1,714=9.98, P=0.002) values occurred in ears of native Hawaiian children. Statistical interaction between gender and age was not significant. Conclusion: Differences in tympanometric findings between groups suggest differences in middle ear function, and these findings continue to underscore the importance of including tympanometry within a hearing screening protocol for early identification of possible hearing impairment."
Exploiting Web service geographical neighborhood for collaborative QoS prediction,"Zhen Chen, Limin Shen, Feng Li, ","Future Generation Computer Systems, Volume 68, March 2017, Pages 248-259, ","Since Web services with equivalent functionalities but different quality are becoming increasingly available on the Internet, predicting the unknown QoS value of a Web service to an active user who has not accessed the service previously is often required for Web service recommendation and composition. Existing collaborative filtering methods suffer from the unavoidable sparsity and cold-start problems and underestimate the role of geographical information that inherently exists in user每service rating oriented model. The principal motivation for using geographical information in Web service QoS prediction stems from the observation that the ratings Web services perform are influenced significantly by their geographical neighborhood, a fact that is verified by our empirical data analysis on the real-world QoS dataset WSDream. Hence, it will be of interest to incorporate this implicit source of information in QoS prediction. In this paper, carefully selected geographical neighbors, clustered using a bottom-up hierarchical neighborhood clustering method, are smoothly integrated into a matrix factorization model, thereby building a more accurate prediction model. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by considering the biases of users and Web services. In experiments using the WSDream QoS dataset, our proposed method outperforms the other competitive methods with respect to accuracy and alleviates the sparsity and cold-start issues."
Association of calpain with insoluble pellet of rat lens,"Kirsten J. Lampi, Larry L. David, Thomas R. Shearer, ","Experimental Eye Research, Volume 55, Issue 2, August 1992, Pages 369-375, ","Calpains are calcium-activated neutral proteases found in many tissues including the lens. The purpose of this research was to localize calpain in various biochemical fractions of the rat lens. Lenses were homogenized (with and without added calcium) and separated into water-soluble and -insoluble fractions, which were further extracted with urea, NaOH, and SDS. Of the total calpain 10% was insoluble. In the lens calpain was found to be both insoluble and associated with the membrane. Extraction of calpain from the insoluble fraction suggested calpain was loosely and tightly associated with the membrane. Calpain associated with membrane-rich fractions was obtained from discontinuous sucrose gradients, confirming the above. Calcium increased the amount of calpain associated with the insoluble fraction up to 30% of the total calpain. When the calcium was chelated, this calpain once again became soluble, and its specific activity was higher than water-soluble calpain. The translocation of calpain from the water-soluble fraction to insoluble fractions by calcium may be important because: (1) it may bring calpain into proximity with its substrates; and (2) it may activate calpain, since membrane phospholipids lower the protease's calcium requirement."

TiN nanoparticles were evenly distributed in the electrode surface, and the adsorbed oxygen content was increased by doping TiN into Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode. Electrochemical tests showed that the TiN-modified electrode has higher electrochemical activity and longer service lifetime, which were helpful to the electrochemical decolorization Orange II solution.

In vitro and in vivo measurements of fiber optic and electrochemical sensors to monitor brain tissue pH,"Sheila A. Grant, Kerry Bettencourt, Peter Krulevitch, Julie Hamilton, Robert Glass, ","Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, Volume 72, Issue 2, 25 January 2001, Pages 174-179, ","We report herein the development of fiber optic and electrochemical pH sensors that could become part of an arsenal to quickly and aggressively treat people undergoing a stroke as well as people who have suffered traumatic brain injury. The fiber optic pH sensor design consists of the immobilization of a pH sensitive dye, seminaphthorhodamine-1 carboxylate (SNARF-1C) within a silica sol每gel matrix. A miniature optoelectronics package was developed to acquire data from the fiber optic sensor. The electrochemical sensor consists of a thin film multilayer coating sputtered on a kapton substrate. The sensors were tested in vitro and in vivo. For both sensors, the in vitro results show linear and reproducible responses in human blood in the pH range 6.8每8.0. The results of the in vivo studies which were performed in Spraque每Dawley rats indicate that both the fiber optic and electrochemical sensors monitor pH with very little drift. It was concluded that both types of sensors would be useful in tracking brain tissue pH."
"A randomized, controlled trial of RSD1235, a novel anti-arrhythmic agent, in the treatment of recent onset atrial fibrillation","Denis Roy, Brian H. Rowe, Ian G. Stiell, Benoit Coutu, for the CRAFT Investigators, ","Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Volume 44, Issue 12, 21 December 2004, Pages 2355-2361, ","The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of intravenous RSD1235 in terminating recent onset atrial fibrillation (AF).Anti-arrhythmic drugs currently available to terminate AF have limited efficacy and safety. RSD1235 is a novel atrial selective anti-arrhythmic drug.This was a phase II, multi-centered, randomized, double-blinded, step-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. Fifty-six patients from 15 U.S. and Canadian sites with AF of 3 to 72 h duration were randomized to one of two RSD1235 dose groups or to placebo. The two RSD1235 groups were RSD-1 (0.5 mg/kg followed by 1 mg/kg) or RSD-2 (2 mg/kg followed by 3 mg/kg), by intravenous infusion over 10 min; a second dose was given only if AF was present. The primary end point was termination of AF during infusion or within 30-min after the last infusion. Secondary end points included the number of patients in sinus rhythm at 0.5, 1, and 24 h post-last infusion and time to conversion to sinus rhythm.The RSD-2 dose showed significant differences over placebo in: 1) termination of AF (61% vs. 5%, p < 0.0005); 2) patients in sinus rhythm at 30 min (56% vs. 5%, p < 0.001); 3) sinus rhythm at 1 h (53% vs. 5%, p = 0.0014); and 4) median time to conversion to SR (14 vs. 162 min, p = 0.016). There were no serious adverse events related to RSD1235.RSD1235, a new atrial-selective anti-arrhythmic agent, appears to be efficacious and safe for converting recent onset AF to sinus rhythm."

The injection was well tolerated by all, except for two patients who developed small haematomas at the site of the injection and 2 patients who complained of dizziness. Ablactation occurred in 100% of the patients in the 40 mg group, but was successful in only 92 and 91% of the patients in the 20 and 30 mg groups, respectively. There were two cases of suboptimal response in the 50 mg group, despite marked reduction in plasma prolactin levels. Both these patients had developed moderate breast engorgement before they received the injection. The difference in response among the four groups was not statistically significant. We recommend that the injection be given prior to the development of breast engorgement."

We examined the number of specialists in oral medicine in OMF departments, the training given to OMF consultants in oral medicine, and the estimated time dedicated to treating patients with oral medical conditions in outpatient clinics. We also examined the pattern and reasons for onward referrals to departments of oral medicine. A postal questionnaire was sent to 300 OMF consultants and was returned by 183 (61%). Sixteen (9%) of the responding consultants had a registered specialist qualification in oral medicine with the General Dental Council (GDC), 15 (8%) had a degree in oral medicine, and 4 (2%) had a diploma. One hundred and eighteen (64%) consultants had been given formal training in oral medicine during their training as registrars. Time dedicated to oral medicine in outpatient clinics varied between less than 20% and more than 40% of total outpatient time. Sixteen surgeons (9%) referred 1每2 patients/week to departments of oral medicine, and 19 (10%) referred 2每4/month. Reasons for referral included need for specialist expertise, failure of treatment, and lack of time in outpatients.

Molecular analysis of expression and function of hFc污RIIbl and b2 isoforms in myeloid cells,"Trupti Joshi, Latha P. Ganesan, Xianhua Cao, Susheela Tridandapani, ","Molecular Immunology, Volume 43, Issue 7, March 2006, Pages 839-850, ","The inhibitory receptor Fc污RIIb becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and associates with the inositol phosphatase SHIP to downregulate phagocytosis. The two splice variants of Fc污RIIb, b1 and b2, are differentially expressed in hematopoetic cells. Both isoforms of Fc污RIIb are expressed in human myeloid cells although Fc污RIIb2 predominates. In murine B cells Fc污RIIb2 associates with clathrin-coated pits and undergoes endocytosis, whereas Fc污RIIbl is excluded from the coated pits, indicating that the two isoforms serve partially differing functions. In humans, there are conflicting reports with regard to the ability of Fc污RIIb2 to become tyrosine phosphorylated, and the functional capacities of the two isoforms are poorly understood. We, and others, have previously reported that the expression of Fc污RIIb is upregulated in human monocytes by the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4. Here, we extend these findings to demonstrate that the IL-4-induced upregulation of Fc污RIIb is synergistically enhanced by the addition of IL-10, both at the protein and the mRNA level. The upregulated receptors are functional as assessed by their ability to become tyrosine phosphorylated and to downregulate phagocytosis. Interestingly, both b1 and b2 isoforms are upregulated by anti-inflammatory cytokines. Transfection experiments expressing human Fc污RIIbl or b2 in Raw 264.7 murine macrophage cells revealed that both isoforms are tyrosine phosphorylated and promote SHIP phosphorylation. Finally, both b1 and b2 isoforms of Fc污RIIb downregulate phagocytosis to a similar extent. Thus we conclude that Fc污RIIbl and b2 are both functional inhibitory receptors in the phagocytic process."

Noroviruses are genetically very diverse, and new genogroups and genotypes are continuously being discovered. Some norovirus genotypes are more commonly found in foodborne outbreaks, suggesting that virological factors may determine virus adsorption characteristics to food surfaces and the efficiency of food-to-person transmission. Noroviruses can be found in a wide range of mammalian species, including pigs and cows that are extensively farmed for human consumption. The zoonotic potential of animal noroviruses via the food chain cannot be ignored."

Enhanced anisotropic response of dielectric elastomer actuators with microcombed and etched carbon nanotube sheet electrodes,"Xiaomeng Fang, Ang Li, Ozkan Yildiz, Huiqi Shao, Tushar K. Ghosh, ","Carbon, Volume 120, August 2017, Pages 366-373, ","Dielectric elastomers (DE), also known as dielectric electroactive polymers offer tremendous potential in a wide-ranging applications including microrobotics and wearable responsive systems. The real-world application of DEs, however, has been limited by a number of factors, including facile means of producing directional stress/strain. As a critical component of the DE actuator, the electrodes should have high electrical conductance under finite in-plane deformation, good electromechanical stability, and ease of shaping based on the design requirements. In this work we investigate highly aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets as electrodes in DE actuators to yield anisotropic electromechanical response. The morphology of CNT sheets were altered by microcombing and selective laser etching to enhance mechanical anisotropy. The enhancement of CNT sheets alignment results in almost pure unidirectional strain of 33% at a relatively moderate electric field. The results demonstrate that the deformation anisotropy of DE actuators can be significantly improved by directional laser etching of the electrodes rather than microcombing alone.Download high-res image (273KB)Download full-size image"

We evaluated the accuracy of ER-MRI compared with subsequent pathology specimen from prostatectomy.We reviewed 309 open radical retropubic prostatectomy cases (RRP) from 2003 to 2008 to identify 94 men with a preoperative ER-MRI, which was obtained in patients with high-risk factors suspicious for local extension (Gleason grade ≡ 4+3, PSA ≡ 10 ng/ml, abnormal rectal exam, or extensive biopsy core involvement). Findings of extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and lymphadenopathy (LAD) on ER-MRI were compared with subsequent findings on pathology specimens.Ninety-four men underwent preoperative ER-MRI. No tumor was seen on ER-MRI in 9 men (10%). Of 94 ER-MRIs, 4% showed SVI, and 12% had ECE. At prostatectomy, lymph nodes were pathologically positive in 10 men, none of which were enlarged on ER-MRI. RRP was aborted in 3 of these 10 patients due to positive nodes confirmed on frozen section. Comparing ER-MRI results to subsequent prostatectomy specimen the results for accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity were 70%, 27%, 76%, 14%, 88% for ECE and 93%, 75%, 94%, 38%, 99% for SVI. The accuracy of ECE prediction was 86% in abnormal rectal exam vs. 66% in normal exam (P < 0.05).Endorectal MRI in the evaluation of high-risk prostate cancer was moderately accurate for SV involvement but inaccurate for ECE and insensitive for metastatic lymph node involvement. The predictive accuracy of ER-MRI improved in patients with an abnormal rectal exam."
Development of generalized interpolation material point method for simulating fully coupled thermomechanical failure evolution,"Jun Tao, Hongwu Zhang, Yonggang Zheng, Zhen Chen, ","Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Volume 332, 15 April 2018, Pages 325-342, ","Based on the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy, the generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) method is further developed in this paper for fully coupled thermomechanical problems, with applications to model-based simulation of failure evolution. The fully coupled thermomechanical GIMP method (CTGIMP) considers the effects of both the temperature on deformation and the deformation on temperature. The discrete governing equations are formulated for both thermomechanical motion and heat conduction. A staggered solution scheme is designed to solve the coupled governing equations with explicit time integration. Representative examples with analytical solutions are presented to verify the proposed CTGIMP for coupled thermomechanical analyses. The CTGIMP is then used for model-based simulation of vibration-induced thermoplasticity, and of failure evolution in a snowy slope under the heat convection condition to demonstrate the potential of the proposed procedure in engineering applications."

In this study, we isolated a cDNA of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) from sea bass, which encoded a single-spanning transmembrane protein of 326 amino acids including a 21-amino acid signal peptide, an extracellular region, a transmembrane region and a 36-amino acid intracellular region included two Ig-like domains (ILDs), and was expressed in multiple lymphoid organs. We then showed that recombinant extracellular domain of sea bass pIgR was capable of binding to Vg as well as IgG and IgM. We also showed that Vg as well as IgG and IgM interacted with pIgR-expressing HEK 293T cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that Vg as well as IgG and IgM were all capable of enhancing phagocytosis by HEK 293T cells and inducing expression of tnf-汐 and il-1汕, via interacting with pIgR. Collectively, these results suggest that fish Vg, analogous to IgG and IgM, can interact with pIgR and result in similar down-stream immune responses, providing an additional evidence that Vg plays an antibody-like role."

Surgical pathology was used as the definitive reference standard. The QUADAS2 tool was used for quality assessment.In total, 162 articles were identified; 12 articles met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Ten studies reported on cytology and 8 studies reported kras mutational analysis. 362 patients (of 1115 total) had surgical pathology available. The sensitivity and specificity of cytology was 0.42 and 0.99; the sensitivity and specificity of kras was 0.39 and 0.95; and the sensitivity and specificity of the combined test of cytology and kras was 0.71 and 0.88, respectively.kras mutational analysis used as an individual screening test has a poor diagnostic accuracy, as does cytology when used alone. The benefit comes with utilization in a combined fashion. More studies are needed to evaluate the correct sequence and utility of these tests for cyst differentiation."
"Uneven development, urbanization and production of space in the middle-scale region based on the case of Jiangsu province, China","Chao Ye, Mingxing Chen, Jinjun Duan, Dongyang Yang, ","Habitat International, Volume 66, August 2017, Pages 106-116, ","The space in the process of urbanization is undergoing a great transition from physical space to social space. The relations between society and space become more important and complicated than ever. As a critical social theory, production of space means that urbanization has been reshaped by social factors or forces like capital, power and class, so that the urban space finally becomes their production and process. Based on socio-spatial dialectic, the main methodology of spatial production, urban space (re)shapes social relations and processes. The different spatial scales have and continuously produce the different social relations. In the researches about production of space, little work has been done on the index system to assess the extent of production of space and to analyze middle-scale region. This article designs a set of simple index system to reflect the spatial influences of capital, power as well as class, and chooses Jiangsu Province as a typical case because of its rapid and differential urbanization to indicate the process of spatial production from 2000 to 2015. In this index system, capital is represented by fixed-asset investment, real estate investment and foreign direct investment; power is represented by the index of the constructed urban land area; the index reflecting class is the urban-rural income ratio. Based on the analysis of these changing indexes, this paper finds that urbanization in Jiangsu is hybrid process: the forces from capital and power greatly contribute to rapid urbanization and high urbanization level, however, the gaps among the three sub-regions in the province and rural-urban income inequality have not decreased accordingly. Conversely, these gaps enlarge in some periods. This kind of urbanization pattern is characterized by large-scale spatial expansion, and is driven by capital and power, but there are many latent social risks and spatial inequality. In the process of spatial production, space and society interact, entangle and (re)shape the pattern of urbanization in the end."

While isolated diastolic heart failure (DHF) accounts for up to a third of all cases of congestive heart failure, the prevalence of SDB in DHF is unknown. We aim to determine the prevalence and characteristics of SDB in a group of patients with symptomatic DHF.Twenty subjects with symptomatic DHF (New York Heart Association class II or III) and isolated diastolic dysfunction on echocardiography were assessed with lung function tests, modified sleep and health questionnaire, and overnight polysomnography. Significant SDB was defined as an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) >10.Thirteen female and seven male subjects (mean age, 65㊣6.0 years; mean body mass index (BMI), 28 ㊣3.2) were evaluated, of whom 17 (85%) had a diagnosis of hypertension. Overall sleep quality was poor, with fragmentation and frequent arousals associated with respiratory events. Fifty-five percent of the patients had significant SDB, mainly obstructive apneas. BMI and the prevalence of hypertension were similar in patients with and without SDB. The deceleration time, an index of diastolic dysfunction, was more prolonged in the group with SDB (236㊣40 ms vs 282㊣31 ms; p<0.05). As a group, a lower minimum percentage arterial oxygen saturation during sleep, but not the AHI was associated with more severe degree of diastolic dysfunction on echocardiogram, including a lower ratio between the early peak transmittal flow velocity and the late peak atrial systolic velocity (rho=0.57; p<0.05) and a prolonged isovolumic relaxation time (rho=〞0.54; p<0.05).SDB is common in patients with DHF. Patients with DHF and SDB may be associated with worse diastolic dysfunction than those without SDB, although a causal relationship remains to be established."

The pathogenic path of norovirus is simple, but it causes a tremendous global burden. Contaminated water is the primary source of norovirus entry into humans, followed by contaminated vegetables, fruits, and shellfish, which are often served raw or not well cooked. Norovirus is highly virulent with a low infectious dose. Once a foodborne infection occurs, person-to-person spread is inevitable, and it is very difficult to control. The impact of norovirus as a pandemic pathogen has not been fully appreciated. The United States and Europe have the most well-established monitoring systems for norovirus-associated foodborne diseases, whereas other countries have only recently begun to follow. An innovative approach is required to control the occurrence of norovirus infection from foods."
Abstraction over implementation structure with symmetrically encapsulated multimethods,"David Lievens, William Harrison, ","Science of Computer Programming, Volume 78, Issue 7, 1 July 2013, Pages 953-968, ","In object-oriented languages, methods are encapsulated, hence module interfaces are made up of sets of methods partitioned along the objects or classes that make up the module. This prevents abstraction over the implementation structure of applications. Any change in method placement may cause a global effect that ripples through all clients depending on that method. Sometimes this unduly restricts the scope of software evolution, particularly for methods with multiple parameters where there is no clear owner. We investigate a simple scheme where methods may be defined in the classes of any of their parameters. This allows client code to be oblivious to choice of method placement, and therefore immune against it changing. When combined with multiple dispatch, this scheme allows for modular extensibility, where methods defined in one class may be overloaded by methods defined in classes that are not its subclasses. We detail our proposal by extending a core calculus of class-based object-oriented languages with these symmetrically encapsulated multimethods, and prove the result sound. It is well-known that multiple dispatch is at odds with modular type-checking. We also discuss different strategies that can be followed to mitigate the type-checking problem and propose variants of the original calculus that are amenable to modular checking."

Chan, Rodney A. Hayward, ","Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Volume 45, Issue 9, 3 May 2005, Pages 1474-1481, ","To investigate the generalizability of the reduction in mortality posed by implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, we examined the effectiveness of defibrillators as applied in routine medical practice.Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators have been shown to be efficacious in the primary and secondary prevention of overall and cardiovascular mortality in clinical trials.Using the National Veterans Administration database, we identified a cohort of 6,996 patients from 1995 to 1999 with new-onset ventricular arrhythmia and pre-existing ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure, of which 1,442 received a defibrillator, and followed them for three years to determine rates of mortality. With multivariate logistic regression analyses that adjusted for demographics, illness severity, and comorbidity, we assessed overall, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular rates of mortality. To further address potential confounding, we also stratified the cohort by quintiles using a multivariable propensity score for each patient and determined mortality rates.For the overall cohort, multivariate regression showed that those who received defibrillators had significantly lower all-cause (odds ratio [OR] 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 0.60) and cardiovascular (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.65)] rates of mortality at three years. No significant differences were noted between groups in their rates of noncardiovascular mortality (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.10). Propensity score analysis demonstrated similar mortality reduction benefits at three years: risk ratio (RR) 0.72 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.79) for all-cause; RR 0.70 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.78) for cardiovascular; and RR 0.95 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.08) for noncardiovascular rates of mortality. These results suggest that one death is prevented in this patient population for every four to five patients receiving a defibrillator for three years.Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in routine medical practice significantly reduce cardiovascular and all-cause rates of mortality at levels similar to secondary prevention trials."
The Use of Dihydrostreptomycin in the Treatment of Tuberculosis,"DAVID T. CARR, H. CORWIN HINSHAW, KARL H. PFUETZE, HENRY A. BROWN, ","Diseases of the Chest, Volume 16, Issue 6, December 1949, Pages 801-815, ","Dihydrostreptomycin, a derivative of streptomycin, has been reported to be as effective as the parent drug against the tubercle bacillus in vitro and against experimental tuberculosis in various animals. The neurotoxicity of the two drugs has also been studied experimentally and dihydrostreptomycin has been reported to be less toxic than streptomycin.The present report summarizes our experience with the first 35 patients whom we treated with the new drug. Dihydrostreptomycin was found to be less neurotoxic than streptomycin, only four of 26 patients showing any sign or symptom of vestibular damage when a daily dose of 2 gm. was given for long periods. Two patients noted slight deafness after treatment was completed and audiograms revealed the development of deafness for the high frequencies in one of them. No allergic reactions occurred, although nine of these 35 patients had 7.5 per cent or more of eosinophils. No other changes in the blood were noted. Studies of function of liver and kidneys did not reveal damage to these organs. Dihydrostreptomycin seemed to be as effective as streptomycin in the treatment of various types of tuberculosis, but much more work must be done to determine if the same doses of the two drugs are equally effective. The frequency of dihydrostreptomycin-resistant strains of tubercle bacilli is not yet known, but three of these patients discharged resistant organisms during treatment, one of them after only 18 days of therapy."
Feasibility and Oncologic Control after Percutaneous Image Guided Ablation of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma,"Brian T. Welch, Matthew R. Callstrom, Jonathan M. Morris, Anil N. Kurup, Thomas D. Atwell, ","The Journal of Urology, Volume 192, Issue 2, August 2014, Pages 357-363, ","We assessed the safety, local control and oncologic efficacy of percutaneous ablation in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.A retrospective review was performed of 61 patients who underwent 74 ablation procedures to treat 82 metastatic renal cell carcinoma lesions with the intent of local eradication. Technical success, local tumor control, complications and patient survival were analyzed according to standard criteria.Four (4.9%) technical failures were observed while 2 patients were lost to followup. Time to recurrence was assessed for the subset of 76 (93%) tumors that were followed after ablation. Six (of 76, 7.9%) tumors recurred at a mean of 1.6 years after ablation (median 1.4, range 0.6 to 2.9). Thus, known overall local tumor control was achieved in 70 of 80 (87.5%) tumors. Estimated local recurrence-free survival rates (95% CI, number still at risk) at 1, 2 and 3 years after ablation were 94% (88每100, 41), 94% (88每100, 32) and 83% (70每97, 17), respectively. Estimated overall survival rates (95% CI, number still at risk) at 1, 2 and 3 years after ablation were 87% (79每97, 42), 83% (73每94, 31) and 76% (63每90, 19), respectively.Image guided ablation of metastatic renal cell carcinoma is a relatively safe procedure with acceptable local control rates. Ablation may offer patients a minimally invasive option of local tumor eradication and warrants a role in the multimodal treatment approach for select patients."
Puncture resistance of pre-strained geotextiles and its relation to uniaxial tensile strain at failure,"Tushar K. Ghosh, ","Geotextiles and Geomembranes, Volume 16, Issue 5, October 1998, Pages 293-302, ",The principal focus of this study is the puncture resistance of geotextiles under uniform radial pre-strain.

The test results show lower failure strain in puncture if the test sample is pre-strained. The failure strain measured in wide width tensile tests are much higher than calculated strains in puncture.

Nucleotide oligomerization domain-2 interacts with 2∩-5∩-oligoadenylate synthetase type 2 and enhances RNase-L function in THP-1 cells,"Jae W. Dugan, Amador Albor, Larry David, Jonathan Fowlkes, Michael P. Davey, ","Molecular Immunology, Volume 47, Issues 2每3, December 2009, Pages 560-566, ","Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-2 (NOD2) is an intracellular protein involved in innate immunity and linked to chronic inflammatory diseases in humans. Further characterization of the full spectrum of proteins capable of binding to NOD2 may provide new insights into its normal functioning as well as the mechanisms by which mutated forms cause disease. Using a proteomics approach to study human THP-1 cells, we have identified 2∩-5∩-oligoadenylate synthetase type 2 (OAS2), a dsRNA binding protein involved in the pathway that activates RNase-L, as a new binding partner for NOD2. The interaction was confirmed using over-expression of OAS2 and NOD2 in HEK cells. Further confirmation was obtained by detecting NOD2 in immunoprecipitates of endogenous OAS2 in THP-1 cells. Finally, over-expression of NOD2 in THP-1 cells led to enhanced RNase-L activity in cells treated with poly(I:C), a mimic of double-stranded RNA virus infection. These data indicate connectivity in pathways involved in innate immunity to bacteria and viruses and suggest a regulatory role whereby NOD2 enhances the function of RNase-L."

Sevoflurane postconditioning improves the spatial learning and memory impairments induced by hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation through suppressing IRE1汐-caspase-12-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway,"Xianwen Hu, Muchun Zhang, Xiaowen Duan, QiQuan Zhang, Ye Zhang, ","Neuroscience Letters, Volume 685, 15 October 2018, Pages 160-166, ","Severe hemorrhagic shock induces cognitive dysfunction by promoting cell death mediated by activating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Sevoflurane postconditioning prevents neuronal apoptosis against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. It is unknown if this protective effect on hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation rats (HSR) is associated with ER stress attenuation. Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected HSR by removing 40% blood volume within 30 min, and 60 min later the animals were resuscitated with infusion of the removing blood in 30 min. Sevoflurane postconditioning was performed by inhaling sevoflurane at three different concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 MAC) at the onset of resuscitation for 30 min. Severe hypotension (mean arterial pressure 40每45 mmHg) occurred in the shock session for 60 min accompanying with significantly elevated lactate, decreased BE and pH values in arterial blood gas analysis. There were impaired spatial learning and memory following HSR indicated by persistently longer escape latency and lower correct rate, as well as less duration and crossing in the target quadrant by using Morris water maze and Y-maze tests. In the hippocampal CA1 region, there was significantly higher activity of caspase-3 induced by HSR. HSR also elevated the expression of inositol-requiring enzyme 1汐 (IRE1汐) and caspase-12 in the hippocampus by western blot analysis. Sevoflurane postconditioning at 1.0 and 1.5 MAC significantly reversed these changes. These findings suggested that sevoflurane postconditioning could improve spatial learning and memory deficits induced by severe hemorrhagic shock and subsequent resuscitation. The suppression of endoplasmic reticulum stress provided critical contribution in neural apoptosis mediated by IRE1汐-caspase-12 pathway."

Development of dual receptor biosensors: an analysis of FRET pairs,"Sheila A Grant, Juntao Xu, Edward J Bergeron, Jennifer Mroz, ","Biosensors and Bioelectronics, Volume 16, Issues 4每5, June 2001, Pages 231-237, ","The development of a dual receptor detection method for enhanced biosensor monitoring was investigated by analyzing potential fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs. The dual receptor scheme requires the integration of a chemical transducer system with two unique protein receptors that bind to a single biological agent. The two receptors are tagged with special molecular groups (donors and acceptors fluorophores) while the chemical transduction system relies on the well-known mechanisms of FRET. During the binding event, the two FRET labeled receptors dock at the binding sites on the surface of the biological agent. The resulting close proximity of the two fluorophores upon binding will initiate the energy transfer resulting in fluorescence. The paper focuses on the analysis and optimization of the chemical transduction system. A variety of FRET fluorophore pairs were tested in a spectrofluorimeter and promising FRET pairs were then tagged to the protein, avidin and its ligand, biotin. Due to their affinities, the FRET-tagged biomolecules combine in solution, resulting in a stable, fluorescent signal from the acceptor FRET dye with a simultaneous decrease in fluorescent signal from the donor FRET dye. The results indicate that the selected FRET pairs can be utilized in the development of dual receptor sensors."
An experimental study on the aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles under environmentally relevant conditions,"Marina Belen Romanello, Maria M.

NanoTiO2 is one of the most commonly employed nanomaterials. In the present work we studied the aggregation rates, aggregate size and aggregate morphology of NanoTiO2 under the presence of inert electrolytes, divalent cations, and these two combined with natural organic matter, in an effort to provide a comprehensive investigation of the phenomena of interaction of nanomaterials and natural waters and elucidate some of the conflicting information reported in the literature. The stability of nanoparticles could be explained in all cases, at least qualitatively, in terms of classical DLVO interactions (Electrical Double Layer, Van der Waals). Divalent cations were adsorbed to the surface of the nanoparticles, neutralizing the negative charge at pH values greater than the point of zero charge and inducing aggregation. Natural organic matter (NOM) adsorbed to the particles and made their zeta potential more negative, hence stabilizing them by lowering the pH of maximum aggregation. Divalent cations partially neutralized the adsorbed NOM, and at high concentrations aggregation was observed with Ca2+ but not Mg2+, suggesting the presence of specific Ca2+每NOM bridges.

Development of a novel FRET immunosensor technique,"Darcy J Lichlyter, Sheila A Grant, Orhan Soykan, ","Biosensors and Bioelectronics, Volume 19, Issue 3, 30 November 2003, Pages 219-226, ","We report on a novel technique to develop an optical immunosensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). IgG antibodies were labeled with acceptor fluorophores while one of three carrier molecules (protein A, protein G, or F(ab∩)2 fragment) was labeled with donor fluorophores. The carrier molecule was incubated with the antibody to allow specific binding to the Fc portion. The labeled antibody每protein complex was then exposed to specific and nonspecific antigens, and experiments were designed to determine the ＆in solution＊ response. The paper reports the results of three different donor每acceptor FRET pairs, fluorescein isothiocyanate/tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate, Texas Red/Cy5, and Alexa Fluor 546/Alexa Fluor 594. The effects of the fluorophore to protein conjugation ratio (F/P ratio) and acceptor to donor fluorophore ratios between the antibody and protein (A/D ratio) were examined. In the presence of specific antigens, the antibodies underwent a conformational change, resulting in an energy transfer from the donor to the acceptor fluorophore as measured by a change in fluorescence. The non-specific antigens elicited little or no changes. The Alexa Fluor FRET pair demonstrated the largest change in fluorescence, resulting in a 35% change. The F/P and A/D ratio will affect the efficiency of energy transfer, but there exists a suitable range of A/D and F/P ratios for the FRET pairs. The feasibility of the FRET immunosensor technique was established; however, it will be necessary to immobilize the complexes onto optical substrates so that consistent trends can be obtained that would allow calibration plots."

However, these two constructs were stable at extremes of pH conditions. Now the question arises: how is MARK4 stable at physiological pH in-vivo? To answer this question, we have successfully cloned, expressed, and purified UBA-domain along with the kinase domain of MARK4 and performed spectroscopic measurements and activity assays.

Here, we studied the interaction of PKR-inhibitor with two variants of human MARK4. One variant is named as MARK4-F1 which has 59 N-terminal residues along with kinase domain while another variant is MARK4-F2 which has kinase domain only. Molecular-docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and fluorescence-binding studies were undertaken to understand the role of N-terminal 59-residues in the binding of substrate/inhibitors. Molecular docking studies revealed that the PKR-inhibitor binds in the large hydrophobic cavity of the kinase domain of MARK4 through several hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonded interactions. Furthermore, MD simulation showed a stable parameters for the complexes of both MARK4-F1 and MARK4-F2 to PKR-inhibitor with marginal difference in their binding affinities. A significant decrease in the fluorescence intensity of MARK4 was observed on successive addition of the PKR-inhibitor. Using fluorescence data we have calculated the binding-affinity and the number of binding site of PKR-inhibitor to the MARK4. A significantly high binding affinity was observed for the PKR-inhibitor to the MARK4 variants. However, there is no any significant difference in the binding affinity of PKR-inhibitor to the MARK4 variants was observed, indicating that 59 N-terminal residues of MARK4-F1 are not playing a crucial role in the ligand binding.

Although the condition has for many years been managed successfully with prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics, the evolution of interventional radiology has seen the use of percutaneously placed ＆pigtail catheters＊ inserted under ultrasound and computed tomography guidance become the mainstay of therapy where such resources are available. This has been suggested to result in a more rapid defervescence of fever and symptoms, shorter periods of intravenous antibiotics and a decreased length of inpatient care. More invasive procedures, aspiration and drainage, together with improved microbiological diagnostic techniques, including polymerase chain reaction testing, has increased the yield of pathogens identified from abscess fluid samples. Culture results will guide treatment, especially for immunocompromised subjects who may develop a lung abscess as a complication of their underlying condition.

Cancer specific survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and predictive ability was evaluated using the concordance index.There were 1,165 deaths (29.1%) from renal cell carcinoma a median of 1.9 years after surgery compared to a median followup of 7.4 years for survivors. The estimated 10-year cancer specific survival rate was 96%, 80%, 66%, 55%, 36%, 26%, 25% and 12% for patients with 2010 primary tumor classifications of pT1a, pT1b, pT2a, pT2b, pT3a, pT3b, pT3c and pT4, respectively (p <0.001). The multivariate concordance index for the 2002 and 2010 TNM classifications was 0.848 and 0.850, respectively.The new 2010 classification remains a robust predictor of cancer specific survival compared to the 2002 classification by dividing pT2 lesions into pT2a and pT2b, reclassifying ipsilateral adrenal involvement as pT4, reclassifying renal vein involvement as pT3a and simplifying nodal involvement as pN0 vs pN1. However, the 2010 TNM classification showed only modest improvement in predictive ability compared to the 2002 classification."

In this work, we propose a methodology to derive the formal specification of operational metrics applicable to design optimization based on life cycle processes, such as ※manufacturing§, ※sunny day operation§, and ※unplanned maintenance§. These operational metrics are presented in the context of an industrial case study for an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) to provide context for the recommended approach.

Inhibition of cerebral protein synthesis: performance at different times after passive avoidance training,"Hasker P. Davis, Curt W. Spanis, Larry R. Squire, ","Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior, Volume 4, Issue 1, January 1976, Pages 13-16, ","Inhibition of cerebral protein synthesis impairs long-term memory in a variety of species and tasks. Recently it was reported that subcutaneous injection of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide impaired short-term retention, measured 10 min after training in a passive avoidance task. To examine the possibility that inhibition of cerebral protein synthesis may sometimes disrupt short-term memory, mice were injected subcutaneously with cycloheximide (120 mg/kg) or anisomycin (150 mg/kg), or bitemporally with cycloheximide or anisomycin (100 米g/side) and given one training trial in a passive avoidance box. Subcutaneously injected cycloheximide reduced step-through latencies 10 min after training as reported previously, but anisomycin or bitemporally injected cycloheximide did not. All 4 drug groups exhibited impaired long-term memory. Since the results obtained at short intervals after training varied depending on the drug and route of injection, the impairment produced by subcutaneous cycloheximide at 10 min after training cannot be attributed to inhibition of cerebral protein synthesis. It is suggested that performance at short intervals after training reflects drug side effects on step-through behavior. By contrast, the impairment obtained at long intervals after training is consistent with the hypothesis that cerebral protein synthesis is required for formation of long-term memory."
Methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) restores 汐-crystallin chaperone activity lost upon methionine oxidation,"Lisa A. Brennan, Wanda Lee, Frank J. Giblin, Larry L. David, Marc Kantorow, ","Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects, Volume 1790, Issue 12, December 2009, Pages 1665-1672, ","Lens cataract is associated with protein oxidation and aggregation. Two proteins that cause cataract when deleted from the lens are methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) that repairs protein methionine sulfoxide (PMSO) oxidized proteins and 汐-crystallin which is a two-subunit (汐A and 汐B) chaperone. Here, we tested whether PMSO formation damages 汐-crystallin chaperone function and whether MsrA could repair PMSO-汐-crystallin.Total 汐-crystallin was oxidized to PMSO and evaluated by CNBr-cleavage and mass spectrometry. Chaperone activity was measured by light scattering using lysozyme as target. PMSO-汐-crystallin was treated with MsrA, and repair was assessed by CNBr cleavage, mass spectrometry and recovery of chaperone function. The levels of 汐-crystallin-PMSO in the lenses of MsrA-knockout relative to wild-type mice were determined.PMSO oxidation of total 汐-crystallin (met 138 of 汐A and met 68 of 汐B) resulted in loss of 汐-crystallin chaperone activity. MsrA treatment of PMSO-汐-crystallin repaired its chaperone activity through reduction of PMSO. Deletion of MsrA in mice resulted in increased levels of PMSO-汐-crystallin.Methionine oxidation damages 汐-crystallin chaperone function and MsrA can repair PMSO-汐-crystallin restoring its chaperone function. MsrA is required for maintaining the reduced state of 汐-crystallin methionines in the lens.Methionine oxidation of 汐-crystallin in combination with loss of MsrA repair causes loss of 汐-crystallin chaperone function. Since increased PMSO levels and loss of 汐-crystallin function are hallmarks of cataract, these results provide insight into the mechanisms of cataract development and likely those of other age-related diseases."

Calpain II induced insolubilization of lens 汕-crystallin polypeptides may induce cataract,"Larry L. David, Jay W. Wright, Thomas R. Shearer, ","Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease, Volume 1139, Issue 3, 7 July 1992, Pages 210-216, ","Addition of calpain II (EC 3.4.22.17) to soluble proteins from 10-day-old rat lens caused an increase in turbidity and production of water-insoluble protein. The insolubilization increased with higher concentrations of both lens protein and calpain II, it could be prevented by the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64; it required at least 0.5 mM Ca2+, it was limited to 6% of the soluble protein present and resulted from precipitation 汕-crystallin polypeptides. When compared by two-dimensional electrophoresis, the insoluble 汕-crystallin polypeptides produced by calpain II were similar to insoluble 汕-crystallin polypeptides found incataractous lenses. Trypsin also caused insolubilization of 汕-crystallin polypeptides, but these polypeptides were unlike polypeptides produced during cataract formation. These data suggested that the loss of solubility was due to a specific removal of N/or C-terminal extensions from 汕-crystallin polypeptides by calpain II, and that a similar process may occur in vivo during cataract formation. It is hypothesized that the insoluble protein produced by calpain II causes cataract by increasing light scatter in the lens."

Keung Leung, ","Journal of Dental Sciences, Volume 9, Issue 1, March 2014, Pages 1-9, ","Type-2 diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease are complex human diseases. Pathogenesis of both ailments is multifactorial, involving chronic disease courses with varied clinical presentations. It is well established in the scientific literature that both diseases are interrelated; in particular, individuals suffering from diabetes are at a higher risk of developing periodontitis. The present review analyzed, using a hypothetical model, the complex factors that may influence the two diseases indirectly, including lifestyle, obesity, diabetes control, oral health behavior, and serum inflammatory factors, and even quality of life. In this review, special attention was given to exploring plausible theoretical or practical explanations of the interrelations and the contemporary evidence base underpinning these. Since the impact of individual general or oral health quality of life factors are substantial, it is very important for health care professionals to appreciate the influence of these factors as controlling these help assist in management of both type-2 diabetes and periodontal diseases thus reducing the social burden of these two complex disease in various populations."
Evaluation of thirteen haloacetic acids and ten trihalomethanes formation by peracetic acid and chlorine drinking water disinfection,"Runmiao Xue, Honglan Shi, Yinfa Ma, John Yang, Todd Eichholz, ","Chemosphere, Volume 189, December 2017, Pages 349-356, ","Free chlorine is a commonly used disinfectant in drinking water treatment. However, disinfection by-products (DBPs) are formed during water disinfection. Haloacetic acids (HAAs) and trihalomethanes (THMs) are two major groups of DBPs. Iodo-HAAs and iodo-THMs (I-HAAs and I-THMs) are formed during the disinfection of the water containing high levels of iodide and are much more toxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogs. Peracetic acid (PAA) is a strong antimicrobial disinfectant that is expected to reduce the formation of HAAs and THMs during disinfection. In this study, the formations of thirteen HAAs and ten THMs, including the iodinated forms, have been investigated during PAA disinfection and chlorination as the comparison. The DBP formations under different iodide concentrations, pHs, and contact times were systematically investigated. Two types of commercial PAAs containing different concentrations of PAA and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were studied. A solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method was upgraded for THM analysis including I-THMs. HAAs were analyzed by following a recently developed high performance ion chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Results show that the ratio of PAA and H2O2 concentration significantly affect the formation of I-THMs and I-HAAs. During PAA disinfection with lower PAA than H2O2, no detectable levels of THMs and HAAs were observed. During PAA disinfection with higher PAA than H2O2, low levels of monoiodoacetic acid, diiodoacetic acid, and iodoform were formed, and these levels were enhanced with the increase of iodide concentration. No significant quantities of chloro- or bromo-THMs and HAAs were formed during PAA disinfection treatment."
Superior prevention of calcium ionophore cataract by E64d,"Mitsuyoshi Azuma, Larry L. David, Thomas R. Shearer, ","Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease, Volume 1180, Issue 2, 10 December 1992, Pages 215-220, ","The purposes of this experiment were: (1), to compare effect of three E64 derivatives, E64, E64c and E64d in preventing nuclear opacity and proteolysis in calcium ionophore-induced cataract and (2), to measure the accumulation of E64 derivatives in the cultured lenses. In vitro E64 and E64c strongly inhibited purified calpain II from porcine heart, while E64d showed weaker inhibition than E64 and E64c. In cultured lenses, all three E64 derivatives reduced nuclear opacity by calcium ionophore A23187 in a concentration-dependent manner, and E64D, the ethyl-ester of E64c, was the most effective. When lenses were cultured in E64d for 2 h, the resulting concentration of E64 derivative in the lens was markedly higher than during culture in E64 of E64c. All three E64 derivatives prevented proteolysis of crystallins seen in A23187 cataract. The stronger effect of E64d against A23187 cataract was likely due to an earlier penetration into the lens, conversion to E64c and inhibition of activated calpain."

An application of backtracking search algorithm in designing power system stabilizers for large multi-machine system,"Naz Niamul Islam, M. A. Hannan, Hussain Shareef, Azah Mohamed, ","Neurocomputing, Volume 237, 10 May 2017, Pages 175-184, ","This paper deals with the backtracking search algorithm (BSA) optimization technique to solve the design problems of multi-machine power system stabilizers (PSSs) in large power system. Power system stability problem is formulated by an optimization problem using the LTI state space model of the power system. To conduct a comprehensive analysis, two test systems (2-AREA and 5-AREA) are considered to explain the variation of design performance with increase in system size. Additionally, two metaheuristic algorithms, namely bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are accounted to evaluate the overall design assessment. The obtained results show that BSA is superior to find consistent solution than BFOA and PSO regardless of system size. The damping performance that achieved from both test systems are sufficient to achieve fast system stability. System stability in linearized model is ensured in terms of eigenvalue shifting towards stability regions. On the other hand, damping performance in the non-linear model is evaluated in terms of overshoot and setting times. The obtained damping in both test systems are stable for BSA based design. However, BFOA and PSO based design perform worst in case of large power system. It is also found that the performance of BSA is not affected for large numbers of parameter optimization compared to PSO, and BFOA optimization techniques. This unique feature encourages recommending the developed backtracking search algorithm for PSS design of large multi-machine power system."
Wavelet based speech presence probability estimator for speech enhancement,"Daniel Pak-Kong Lun, Tak-Wai Shen, Tai-Chiu Hsung, Dominic K. C. Ho, ","Digital Signal Processing, Volume 22, Issue 6, December 2012, Pages 1161-1173, ","A reliable speech presence probability (SPP) estimator is important to many frequency domain speech enhancement algorithms. It is known that a good estimate of SPP can be obtained by having a smooth a-posteriori signal to noise ratio (SNR) function, which can be achieved by reducing the noise variance when estimating the speech power spectrum. Recently, the wavelet denoising with multitaper spectrum (MTS) estimation technique was suggested for such purpose. However, traditional approaches directly make use of the wavelet shrinkage denoiser which has not been fully optimized for denoising the MTS of noisy speech signals. In this paper, we firstly propose a two-stage wavelet denoising algorithm for estimating the speech power spectrum. First, we apply the wavelet transform to the periodogram of a noisy speech signal. Using the resulting wavelet coefficients, an oracle is developed to indicate the approximate locations of the noise floor in the periodogram. Second, we make use of the oracle developed in stage 1 to selectively remove the wavelet coefficients of the noise floor in the log MTS of the noisy speech. The wavelet coefficients that remained are then used to reconstruct a denoised MTS and in turn generate a smooth a-posteriori SNR function. To adapt to the enhanced a-posteriori SNR function, we further propose a new method to estimate the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR), which is an essential parameter for SPP estimation. Simulation results show that the new SPP estimator outperforms the traditional approaches and enables an improvement in both the quality and intelligibility of the enhanced speeches."

The work is motivated by the tremendous potential offered by the current multicomponent fiber forming technologies as a means to fabricate fiber actuators. To explore the potential, prototype fiber actuators have been fabricated using commercially available dielectric elastomer tubes and by applying appropriate compliant electrodes to inner cavity and outer walls of these tubes. The force and displacement generated by such actuators have been studied as a function of applied electric field under different prestrained conditions. In order to introduce anisotropy in the fiber behavior, two types of prestrains (uniaxial and uniform) were applied. Actuation strains of 7 and 18% were recorded for silicone tubes in the axial and radial directions, respectively. Polyurethane tubes produced significantly higher blocking force compared to silicone tubes. The results demonstrate significant influence of applied prestrain on actuation strains and blocking force measured under isometric condition."
"The costs of delaying remediation on human, ecological, and eco-cultural resources: Considerations for the Department of Energy: A methodological framework","Joanna Burger, Michael Gochfeld, David S. Kosson, Kevin G. Brown, Jennifer A. Salisbury, ","Science of The Total Environment, Volume 649, 1 February 2019, Pages 1054-1064, ","Remediation and restoration of the Nation's nuclear legacy of radiological and chemical contaminated areas is an ongoing and costly challenge for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). For large sites, such as the Hanford and Savannah River Sites, successful remediation involves complex decisions related to remedies, end-states, timing, and sequencing of cleanup of separate and related contaminated units within a site. Hanford Site cannot clean up every unit simultaneously due to limits in funding, personnel, and technology. This paper addresses one of the major considerations - the consequences of delaying remediation of a unit on different receptors (e.g. people, ecological, and eco-cultural resources), using the DOE Hanford Site as a case study. We develop a list of attributes that managers should consider for successful remediation, examine how delaying remediation could affect workers, the public and ecological resources (including water resources), and use some examples to illustrate potential effects of delays. The factors to consider when deciding whether and how long to delay remediation of a unit include personnel, information and data, funding, equipment, structural integrity, contaminant source, and resource vulnerability. Each of these factors affects receptors differently. Any remediation task may be dependent on other remediation projects, on the availability of transport, containers, interim storage and ultimate disposition decisions, or the availability of trained personnel. Delaying remediation may have consequences for people (e.g. workers, site neighbors), plants, animals, ecosystems, and eco-cultural resources (i.e. those cultural values that depend upon ecological resources). The risks, benefits, and uncertainties for evaluating the consequences of delaying remediation are described and discussed. Assessing the advantages and disadvantages of delaying remediation is important for health professionals, ecologists, resource trustees, regulators, Tribal members, recreationists, fishermen, hunters, conservationists, and a wide range of other stakeholders.Download high-res image (72KB)Download full-size image"
Outcomes and Clinicopathologic Variables Associated With Late Recurrence After Nephrectomy for Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma,"Simon P. Kim, Christopher J. Weight, Bradley C. Leibovich, R. Houston Thompson, Stephen A. Boorjian, ","Urology, Volume 78, Issue 5, November 2011, Pages 1101-1106, ","To characterize the incidence and clinicopathologic factors associated with late recurrence after surgical resection for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) because the recurrence patterns >5 years after nephrectomy have been poorly described.We identified 1454 patients treated with nephrectomy for localized RCC from 1970 to 2000 who had remained free of disease for 5 years. Subsequent tumor recurrence was classified as renal recurrence and distant metastasis. The incidence of recurrence >5 years from surgery was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The associations of clinicopathologic variables with late recurrence were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression models.With a median postoperative follow-up of 13.9 years (range 5.1-38.9), 63 patients (4.3%) experienced late renal recurrence at a median of 9.3 years (range 5.1-25.3), and 172 patients (11.8%) developed late distant metastases at a median of 9.6 years (range 5.1-26.6) after surgery. The estimated recurrence-free survival rate at 10 and 15 years was 97.3% and 95.2% for renal recurrence, and 93.1% and 85.9% for distant metastases, respectively. On multivariate analysis, increased tumor size (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12; P < .001) was associated with late renal tumor recurrence, and increased tumor size (HR 1.07; P = .018), clear cell or collecting duct histologic features (HR 3.76; P < .001), and tumor Stage pT1b (HR 2.8; P < .001), pT2a (HR 4.5; P < .001), pT2b (HR 3.4; P = .007), and pT3-pT4 (HR 5.1; P < .001) were associated with distant metastasis.After an initial 5-year postoperative disease-free interval, approximately 5% and 15% of patients will develop renal recurrence and distant metastases, respectively, during the next decade. Therefore, long-term surveillance remains necessary after nephrectomy."
Energy transfer or electron transfer?〞DFT study on the mechanism of [2+2] cycloadditions induced by visible light photocatalysts,"Mingyang Jiao, Yi-wen Ju, Bo-Zhen Chen, ","Tetrahedron Letters, Volume 59, Issue 17, 25 April 2018, Pages 1651-1660, ","The intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of 1,3-dienes under visible light irradiation investigated by Yoon and his co-workers shows remarkably high yield and stereoselective differences under different photocatalysts. The reaction was speculated to be induced by energy transfer. However, the origin for these phenomena is still unclear. In this scene, the detailed mechanism for the [2+2] cycloaddition of 1,3-dienes under visible light has been investigated using density functional theory B3LYP and TPSSTPSS methods. The result shows that the reaction not only can be induced by energy transfer between photocatalysts and reactants, but also can be induced by electron transfer between them. The [2+2] cycloaddition induced by energy transfer is carried out along the potential energy surface (PES) of triplet excited states (T1) firstly, and then goes back to the singlet ground state (S0) via MECPs (minimum energy crossing points) between the PESs of the S0 and T1 states, forming the product in the S0 state. The [2+2] reaction induced by electron transfer proceeds along the doublet state PES of the cation radical reactant and the neutral four-membered ring product could be obtained by electron transfer from the corresponding reactant or reduced photocatalyst. The origin of stereoselectivity of the [2+2] reaction is attributed to the reaction mechanism difference under different photocatalysts.Download high-res image (117KB)Download full-size image"

Results from animal models indicate that prenatal exposure to maternal stress and stress hormones has lasting consequences for development of the offspring. Few prospective studies of human pregnancy have examined the consequences of prenatal exposure to stress and stress hormones.In this study the effects of prenatal maternal psychosocial (anxiety, depression, and perceived stress) and endocrine (cortisol) indicators of stress on infant temperament were examined in a sample of 247 full-term infants. Maternal salivary cortisol and psychological state were evaluated at 18-20, 24-26, and 30-32 weeks of gestation and at 2 months postpartum. Infant temperament was assessed with a measure of negative reactivity (the fear subscale of the Infant Temperament Questionnaire) at 2 months of age.Elevated maternal cortisol at 30-32 weeks of gestation, but not earlier in pregnancy, was significantly associated with greater maternal report of infant negative reactivity. Prenatal maternal anxiety and depression additionally predicted infant temperament. The associations between maternal cortisol and maternal depression remained after controlling for postnatal maternal psychological state.These data suggest that prenatal exposure to maternal stress has consequences for the development of infant temperament."

All specimens were reviewed by a single uropathologist for microvascular and capillary-lymphatic invasion. Associations with time to metastasis and death from renal cell carcinoma were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models, controlling for established clinicopathological prognostic variables.Microvascular invasion and capillary-lymphatic invasion were identified in 119 (11%) and 17 (2%) of the 1,103 patients with clear cell, 5 (2%) and 1 (less than 1%) of the 219 with papillary, and 1 (1%) and 0 of the 86 with chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, respectively.

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma cases microvascular invasion was univariately associated with an increased risk of metastasis and cancer specific death (HR 3.5 and 3.0, respectively, each p <0.001). However, on multivariate analysis these associations were no longer statistically significant (HR 1.2, p = 0.4 and HR 1.3, p = 0.1, respectively). Capillary-lymphatic invasion remained significantly associated with an increased risk of metastasis and death on univariate analysis (HR 15.9 and 11.6) and on multivariate analysis (HR 3.2 and HR 3.1, respectively, each p <0.001).Microvascular invasion is associated with an increased risk of metastasis and cancer death in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, although this did not remain significant after controlling for established prognostic variables. Capillary-lymphatic invasion appears to be independently associated with metastasis and cancer death even after controlling for known prognostic risk factors. However, given its rarity, this feature may prove to be of limited clinical significance."
Global approach to reducing lead exposure and poisoning,"Pamela A. Meyer, Mary Jean Brown, Henry Falk, ","Mutation Research/Reviews in Mutation Research, Volume 659, Issues 1每2, July每August 2008, Pages 166-175, ","Lead poisoning is an important environmental disease that can have life-long adverse health effects. Most susceptible are children, and most commonly exposed are those who are poor and live in developing countries. Studies of children's blood-lead levels (BLLs) are showing cognitive impairment at increasingly lower BLLs. Lead is dangerous at all levels in children.The sources of lead exposure vary among and within countries depending on past and current uses. Sources of lead may be from historic contamination, recycling old lead products, or from manufacturing new products. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average population BLLs have declined rapidly. In many developing countries where leaded gasoline is no longer used, many children and workers are exposed to fugitive emissions and mining wastes. Unexpected lead threats, such as improper disposal of electronics and children's toys contaminated with lead, continue to emerge.The only medical treatment available is chelation, which can save lives of persons with very high BLLs. However, chelating drugs are not always available in developing countries and have limited value in reducing the sequelae of chronic low dose lead exposure. Therefore, the best approach is to prevent exposure to lead. Because a key strategy for preventing lead poisoning is to identify and control or eliminate lead sources, this article highlights several major sources of lead poisoning worldwide. In addition, we recommend three primary prevention strategies for lead poisoning: identify sources, eliminate or control sources, and monitor environmental exposures and hazards."
A novel low-rank model for MRI using the redundant wavelet tight frame,"Zhen Chen, Yuli Fu, Youjun Xiang, Junwei Xu, Rong Rong, ","Neurocomputing, Volume 289, 10 May 2018, Pages 180-187, ","The low-rank matrix reconstruction has been attracted significant interest in compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI). To the end of computability, rank is often modeled by nuclear norm. The singular value thresholding (SVT) algorithm is taken as a solver of this model, usually. However, this model with the solver may be insufficient to obtain a high quality magnetic resonance (MR) image at high speed. Still inspired by the low-rank matrix reconstruction idea, we proposes a novel low-rank model with a new scheme of the weight selection to reconstruct the MR image under the redundant wavelet tight frame. A fast and accurate solver is given for the proposed model. Further, a new scheme is presented to accelerate the proposed solver. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed solver and its accelerated version can converge stably. The proposed method is faster than some existing methods with the comparable quality."
Developmental changes in hippocampal shape among preadolescent children,"Muqing Lin, Peter T. Fwu, Claudia Buss, Elysia P. Davis, Min-Ying Su, ","International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience, Volume 31, Issue 7, November 2013, Pages 473-481, ","It is known that the largest developmental changes in the hippocampus take place during the prenatal period and during the first two years of postnatal life. Few studies have been conducted to address the normal developmental trajectory of the hippocampus during childhood. In this study shape analysis was applied to study the normal developing hippocampus in a group of 103 typically developing 6- to 10-year-old preadolescent children. The individual brain was normalized to a template, and then the hippocampus was manually segmented and further divided into the head, body, and tail sub-regions. Three different methods were applied for hippocampal shape analysis: radial distance mapping, surface-based template registration using the robust point matching (RPM) algorithm, and volume-based template registration using the Demons algorithm. All three methods show that the older children have bilateral expanded head segments compared to the younger children. The results analyzed based on radial distance to the centerline were consistent with those analyzed using template-based registration methods. In analyses stratified by sex, it was found that the age-associated anatomical changes were similar in boys and girls, but the age-association was strongest in girls. Total hippocampal volume and sub-regional volumes analyzed using manual segmentation did not show a significant age-association. Our results suggest that shape analysis is sensitive to detect sub-regional differences that are not revealed in volumetric analysis. The three methods presented in this study may be applied in future studies to investigate the normal developmental trajectory of the hippocampus in children. They may be further applied to detect early deviations from the normal developmental trajectory in young children for evaluating susceptibility for psychopathological disorders involving hippocampus."
Vitellogenin is an immunocompetent molecule for mother and offspring in fish,"Shicui Zhang, Yuan Dong, Pengfei Cui, ","Fish & Shellfish Immunology, Volume 46, Issue 2, October 2015, Pages 710-715, ","Our understanding of the function of vitellogenin (Vg) in reproduction has undergone a transformation over the past decade in parallel with new insights into the role of Vg in immunity. Initially, Vg was regarded as a female-specific reproductive protein, which is cleaved into yolk proteins such as phosvitin (Pv) and lipovitellin (Lv), stored in egg, providing the nutrients for developing embryos. Recently, Vg is shown to be an immune-relevant molecule involved in the defense of the host against the microbes including bacterium and virus. Furthermore, Pv and Lv, that both are proteolytically cleaved products of Vg, play a defense role in developing embryos. Importantly, yolk protein-derived small peptides also display antimicrobial activity. These data together indicate that Vg, in addition to being involved in yolk protein formation, plays a non-reproductive role via functioning as an immune-relevant molecule in both parent fishes and their offspring. It also shows that yolk proteins and their degraded peptides are novel players in maternal immunity, opening a new avenue to study the functions of reproductive proteins.Download full-size image"
Purification of calpain II from rat lens and determination of endogenous substrates,"Larry L. David, Thomas R. Shearer, ","Experimental Eye Research, Volume 42, Issue 3, March 1986, Pages 227-238, ","Calpain II (EC 3.4.22.17), a calcium-dependent neutral protease, was purified approximately 7000-fold from the soluble fraction of rat lens. The estimated molecular weight of rat lens calpain II was 120 000, and the enzyme was composed of 80 000 and 28 000 MW subunits. Calpain II required 400 米m calcium, a reducing agent, and pH = 7﹞5 for maximal activity. The enzyme could not be activated by magnesium, and was inhibited by leupeptin and iodoacetate, but not by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Purified calpain II degraded rat 汐-, 汕H-, and 汕L-crystallins, insoluble proteins, and intrinsic membrane proteins. 污-Crystallin was not degraded. The proteolysis caused by purified calpain II was similar to proteolysis occurring during the formation of several experimental cataracts in rodents; this suggested that the enzyme may play a role in cataract formation."

Amphiphilic semiconducting polymer as multifunctional nanocarrier for fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging guided chemo-photothermal therapy,"Yuyan Jiang, Dong Cui, Yuan Fang, Xu Zhen, Kanyi Pu, ","Biomaterials, Volume 145, November 2017, Pages 168-177, ","Chemo-photothermal nanotheranostics has the advantage of synergistic therapeutic effect, providing opportunities for optimized cancer therapy. However, current chemo-photothermal nanotheranostic systems generally comprise more than three components, encountering the potential issues of unstable nanostructures and unexpected conflicts in optical and biophysical properties among different components. We herein synthesize an amphiphilic semiconducting polymer (PEG-PCB) and utilize it as a multifunctional nanocarrier to simplify chemo-photothermal nanotheranostics. PEG-PCB has a semiconducting backbone that not only serves as the diagnostic component for near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging, but also acts as the therapeutic agent for photothermal therapy. In addition, the hydrophobic backbone of PEG-PCB provides strong hydrophobic and 羽-羽 interactions with the aromatic anticancer drug such as doxorubicin for drug encapsulation and delivery. Such a trifunctionality of PEG-PCB eventually results in a greatly simplified nanotheranostic system with only two components but multimodal imaging and therapeutic capacities, permitting effective NIR fluorescence/PA imaging guided chemo-photothermal therapy of cancer in living mice. Our study thus provides a molecular engineering approach to integrate essential properties into one polymer for multimodal nanotheranostics.Download high-res image (233KB)Download full-size image"

De Novo Truncating Variants in ASXL2 Are Associated with a Unique and Recognizable Clinical Phenotype,"Vandana Shashi, Loren D. M. Pena, Katherine Kim, Barbara Burton, Fanny Kort邦m, ","The American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 99, Issue 4, 6 October 2016, Pages 991-999, ","The ASXL genes (ASXL1, ASXL2, and ASXL3) participate in body patterning during embryogenesis and encode proteins involved in epigenetic regulation and assembly of transcription factors to specific genomic loci. Germline de novo truncating variants in ASXL1 and ASXL3 have been respectively implicated in causing Bohring-Opitz and Bainbridge-Ropers syndromes, which result in overlapping features of severe intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. ASXL2 has not yet been associated with a human Mendelian disorder. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing in six unrelated probands with developmental delay, macrocephaly, and dysmorphic features. All six had de novo truncating variants in ASXL2. A careful review enabled the recognition of a specific phenotype consisting of macrocephaly, prominent eyes, arched eyebrows, hypertelorism, a glabellar nevus flammeus, neonatal feeding difficulties, hypotonia, and developmental disabilities. Although overlapping features with Bohring-Opitz and Bainbridge-Ropers syndromes exist, features that distinguish the ASXL2-associated condition from ASXL1- and ASXL3-related disorders are macrocephaly, absence of growth retardation, and more variability in the degree of intellectual disabilities. We were also able to demonstrate with mRNA studies that these variants are likely to exert a dominant-negative effect, given that both alleles are expressed in blood and the mutated ASXL2 transcripts escape nonsense-mediated decay. In conclusion, de novo truncating variants in ASXL2 underlie a neurodevelopmental syndrome with a clinically recognizable phenotype. This report expands the germline disorders that are linked to the ASXL genes."
Nurses' utilisation of complementary therapies: a pilot study exploring scope of practice,"Marianne Wallis, Anita Peerson, Jeanine Young, Scott Parkinson, Sheila Grant, ","Collegian, Volume 11, Issue 4, 2004, Pages 19-25, ","The increasing use of complementary therapies (CTs) by the public requires nurses to be fully informed about the use and safety of these modalities. In addition, nurses need to be aware of what constitutes complementary therapy practice, its overlap with nursing practice and how to respond appropriately to patients' requests for access to and information about CTs. A pilot study that aimed to describe nurses' knowledge about, and the use of CTs was conducted in four hospitals in southeast Queensland, Australia. One hundred and twenty-nine nurses (65% response rate) of varying levels of qualification and expertise completed a questionnaire. Over 80% of the participants indicated that they engaged in some form of complementary therapy (CT) activity. The entire sample worked in acute care hospitals but 5% engaged in CTs while employed in a second job. These nurses worked in either individual private practice or a multidisciplinary clinic setting. Only 2% of the sample had formal qualifications in a specific CT. Many nurses seemed unsure about what should be defined as a CT. The most common CTs engaged in by nurses were massage, music therapy and relaxation techniques but some nurses also participated in acupuncture, acupressure, hypnotherapy and osteopathy. Some nurses were confused about the difference between CT and usual nursing care. In addition, there were knowledge deficits relating to institutional policies and professional standards. Our findings suggest that nurses require more education about the scope of CT and how it differs from nursing practice. Nurses also require access to clear policies about the safe use of CTs in specific practice settings and about appropriate referral of clients to complementary therapists with accredited qualifications."

Chapter One: Analysis of Catalyst Surface Structure by Physical Sorption,"Karl D. Hammond, Wm. Curtis Conner, ","Advances in Catalysis, Volume 56, 2013, Pages 1-101, ","Heterogeneous catalysis usually takes place by sequences of reactions involving fluid-phase reagents and the exposed layer of the solid catalyst surface. Estimation of the total catalyst surface area, its potential accessibility to gas- or liquid-phase reactants, and general catalytic activity are initially based on the morphology of the catalyst. Universally, measurements of adsorption and their interpretation are used to estimate the surface area and porosity relevant to catalytic reactions. We provide here a description of many traditional and recent techniques in adsorption-based catalyst characterization intended for experimental practitioners of adsorption. Our chapter includes descriptions of which regions of the isotherm correspond to micropore filling, mesopore filling, surface coverage, and saturation, supplemented by discussions of model isotherms, from the Langmuir isotherm and the Brunauer每Emmett每Teller theory to the Halsey equation. Pore size distribution methods include the Barrett每Joyner每Halenda and related methods for mesopores, empirical methods developed for micropores, and simulation-based methods that have finally resolved the differences between adsorption (increasing loading) and desorption (decreasing loading).

These helium clusters are attracted to tungsten surfaces due to an elastic interaction force that drives surface segregation. As the clusters migrate toward the surface, trap mutation and cluster dissociation are activated at rates higher than in the bulk. These kinetic processes are responsible for important structural, morphological, and compositional features in plasma-exposed tungsten, including surface adatoms, near-surface immobile helium每vacancy complexes, and retained helium content. Detailed results are presented for di-helium and tri-helium clusters near low-Miller-index tungsten surfaces."

Hammond, ","Journal of Nuclear Materials, Volume 508, September 2018, Pages 159-167, ","We simulate the influence of distributed xenon gas bubbles on the effective thermal conductivity of irradiated U-10Mo fuel using a two-dimensional finite element method (FEM). The effective thermal conductivity of the inhomogeneous materials is estimated by solving the heat equation on a two-dimensional domain and estimating the mean temperature and heat flux. Bubble size distributions representative of both intra- and inter-granular fission gas bubbles are simulated. A distribution consistent with a gas bubble superlattice is compared to less-ordered bubble distributions in the intra-granular case. For inter-granular bubbles, the bubbles' spatial and size distribution was estimated from a two-dimensional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of fission gas bubbles that had collected on grain boundaries. The obtained results are compared with some theoretical models and experimental results. The results indicate that the pressure inside the bubbles has minimal influence on the overall thermal conductivity. The effect of krypton concentration is also negligible compared to pure xenon bubbles. Bubble arrangement is also insignificant unless a relatively wide bubble-free path through the metal exists. However, the area fraction of xenon bubbles has a significant impact on the overall thermal conductivity."
Influence of fiber characteristics on directed electroactuation of anisotropic dielectric electroactive polymers with tunability,"Krishna B. Subramani, Richard J. Spontak, Tushar K. Ghosh, ","Composites Science and Technology, Volume 154, 18 January 2018, Pages 187-193, ","Dielectric elastomers constitute a technologically important class of stimuli-responsive polymers due primarily to their unique ability to achieve large strains (>300 area%) upon exposure to an external electric field. In most reported cases, actuation strains are measured as dielectric elastomers constrained to a circular test configuration essentially waste energy by undergoing isotropic, rather than directional, electroactuation. Recent independent studies have demonstrated, however, that the addition of relatively stiff fibers to a soft dielectric elastomer matrix promotes more energy-efficient anisotropic mechanical behavior and electroactuation response. In this work, we investigate the effects of fiber strain and mechanical properties on electroactuation in anisotropic dielectric electroactive polymers with tunability (ADEPT) fabricated from an acrylic dielectric elastomer. Increases in fiber loading level and stiffness are observed to enhance both mechanical and electroactuation properties to different extents, and we introduce an electroactuation anisotropic enhancement factor to quantify the ratio of electroactuation to mechanical anisotropy. This factor is determined to vary linearly with fiber concentration for nearly all the different ADEPT composites examined in this study."

Kinetic parameters and oxidation behavior for each grade were compared by coke type, filler grain size and microstructure. The thickness of the oxidized layer for each grade was determined by layer peeling and direct density measurements. The results for NBG-17 and IG-11 were compared with those available in the literature and our recently reported results for NBG-18 and IG-110 oxidation in air. The finer-grained graphites IG-110 and IG-11 were more oxidized than medium-grained NBG-18 and NBG-17 because of deeper oxidant penetration, higher porosity and higher probability of available active sites. Variation in experimental conditions also had a marked effect on the reported kinetic parameters by several studies. Kinetic parameters such as activation energy and transition temperature were sensitive to air flow rates as well as sample size and geometry."

However, little is known about the relationship between personality as a comprehensive reflection of stable psychological states and outcome after total knee arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship between patients＊ diverse personalities and clinical outcomes.We recruited 387 patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty to complete the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) and collected demographic information before surgery. Prior to and 6 months after surgery, we used two validated functional instruments to assess satisfaction rate〞the Short Form Health Survey of 36 questions (SF-36), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC).Neuroticism, especially the classic type, tended to be displayed more frequently by women and younger patients. A statistically significant positive relationship was seen between outcome scores and extraversion levels in rating scales; there was a negative relationship between outcome scores especially from the SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS), WOMAC pain scores, and neuroticism subscales scores. Among four types of personality, sanguine patients displayed the best clinical outcomes and melancholic patients the worst. Despite good clinical outcomes, including in pain relief and functional improvement for choleric patients, satisfaction rate was unexpectedly the lowest.Our results may help clinicians identify patients at risk for poor postoperative clinical outcomes and thus proceed with better communication with patients. Also, our results may indicate conducting individual attention during the perioperative period based on patient personality determined according to the EPQ in order to help attain better recovery."

The first noise source is accompanied by a correlation between capacitance estimates, whereas the second noise source is due to ※1/f-like§ current noise. An analytic expression that summarizes the noise from thermal and 1/f sources is derived, which agrees with experimental measurements from actual cells over a large frequency range. Our results demonstrate that the optimal frequencies for capacitance measurements are higher than previously believed. Finally, we demonstrate that the capacitance noise at high frequencies can be reduced by compensating for the voltage drop of the sine wave across the series resistance."

Formal analysis of SEU mitigation for early dependability and performability analysis of FPGA-based space applications,"Khaza Anuarul Hoque, Otmane Ait Mohamed, Yvon Savaria, ","Journal of Applied Logic, Volume 25, December 2017, Pages 47-68, ","SRAM-based FPGAs are increasingly popular in the aerospace industry due to their field programmability and low cost. However, they suffer from cosmic radiation induced Single Event Upsets (SEUs). In safety-critical applications, the dependability of the design is a prime concern since failures may have catastrophic consequences. An early analysis of the relationship between dependability metrics, performability-area trade-off, and different mitigation techniques for such applications can reduce the design effort while increasing the design confidence. This paper introduces a novel methodology based on probabilistic model checking, for the analysis of the reliability, availability, safety and performance-area tradeoffs of safety-critical systems for early design decisions. Starting from the high-level description of a system, a Markov reward model is constructed from the Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG) and a component characterization library targeting FPGAs. The proposed model and exhaustive analysis capture all the failure states (based on the fault detection coverage) and repairs possible in the system. We present quantitative results based on an FIR filter circuit to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach and to demonstrate that a wide range of useful dependability and performability properties can be analyzed using the proposed methodology. The modeling results show the relationship between different mitigation techniques and fault detection coverage, exposing their direct impact on the design for early decisions."
MARRVEL: Integration of Human and Model Organism Genetic Resources to Facilitate Functional Annotation of the Human Genome,"Julia Wang, Rami Al-Ouran, Yanhui Hu, Seon-Young Kim, Hugo J. Bellen, ","The American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 100, Issue 6, 1 June 2017, Pages 843-853, ","One major challenge encountered with interpreting human genetic variants is the limited understanding of the functional impact of genetic alterations on biological processes. Furthermore, there remains an unmet demand for an efficient survey of the wealth of information on human homologs in model organisms across numerous databases. To efficiently assess the large volume of publically available information, it is important to provide a concise summary of the most relevant information in a rapid user-friendly format. To this end, we created MARRVEL (model organism aggregated resources for rare variant exploration). MARRVEL is a publicly available website that integrates information from six human genetic databases and seven model organism databases. For any given variant or gene, MARRVEL displays information from OMIM, ExAC, ClinVar, Geno2MP, DGV, and DECIPHER. Importantly, it curates model organism-specific databases to concurrently display a concise summary regarding the human gene homologs in budding and fission yeast, worm, fly, fish, mouse, and rat on a single webpage. Experiment-based information on tissue expression, protein subcellular localization, biological process, and molecular function for the human gene and homologs in the seven model organisms are arranged into a concise output. Hence, rather than visiting multiple separate databases for variant and gene analysis, users can obtain important information by searching once through MARRVEL. Altogether, MARRVEL dramatically improves efficiency and accessibility to data collection and facilitates analysis of human genes and variants by cross-disciplinary integration of 18 million records available in public databases to facilitate clinical diagnosis and basic research."

In addition to known clinical risk factors such as low birth weight and gestational age, there is a growing body of evidence supporting a genetic basis for ROP.Although comorbidities and environmental factors〞most notably gestational age and oxygen〞have been identified as contributing to ROP outcomes in premature infants, some infants progress to severe disease despite absence of these clinical risk factors. The contribution of genetic factors may explain these differences and allow better detection and treatment of infants at risk for severe ROP.To comprehensively review genetic factors that potentially contribute to the development and severity of ROP, we conducted a literature search focusing on the genetic basis for ROP. Terms related to other heritable retinal vascular diseases such as ※familial exudative vitreoretinopathy,§ as well as to genes implicated in animal models of ROP, were also used to capture research in diseases with similar pathogenesis to ROP in humans with known genetic components.Contributions across several genetic domains are described, including vascular endothelial growth factor, the Wnt signaling pathway, insulin-like growth factor 1, inflammatory mediators, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.Most candidate gene studies of ROP have limitations such as inability to replicate results, conflicting results from various studies, small sample size, and differences in clinical characterization. Additional difficulty arises in separating the contribution of genetic factors such as Wnt signaling to ROP and prematurity. Although studies have implicated involvement of multiple signaling pathways in ROP, the genetics of ROP have not been clearly elucidated. Next-generation sequencing and genome-wide association studies have potential to expand future understanding of underlying genetic risk factors and pathophysiology of ROP."

Ammonia-oxidizing archaea involved in nitrogen removal,"Jia You, Atreyee Das, Elizabeth M. Dolan, Zhiqiang Hu, ","Water Research, Volume 43, Issue 7, April 2009, Pages 1801-1809, ","Ammonia oxidation is critical to global nitrogen cycling and is often thought to be driven only by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. The recent finding of new ammonia-oxidizing organisms belonging to the archaeal domain challenges this perception. Two major microbial groups are now believed to be involved in ammonia oxidation: chemolithotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). Candidatus ※Nitrosopumilus maritimus§, the first isolated ammonia-oxidizing archaeon from a tropical marine aquarium tank, representative of the ubiquitous marine group 1 Crenarchaeota, contains putative genes for all three subunits (amoA, amoB, and amoC) of ammonia monooxygenase, the key enzyme responsible for ammonia oxidation. In this article, important concepts of the nitrogen cycle, ammonia oxidation processes, ammonia-oxidizing organisms, and their physiology are described. AOA are found to thrive in various habitats including hot/thermal springs, marine and fresh waters, soils, and wastewater treatment systems, where they may outnumber their counterpart, AOB. Various molecular tools have been applied to study AOB and AOA and determine their abundance and community structure changes from natural and engineered systems. The presence of AOA in activated sludge opens new opportunities for elucidating its role of ammonia removal in wastewater treatment plants and wetlands. Several significant questions related to AOA research have been raised to evoke reader involvement for broadening future studies."
Measuring antiviral activity of benzimidazole molecules that alter IRES RNA structure with an infectious hepatitis C virus chimera expressing Renilla luciferase,"Shuanghu Liu, Cassie A. Nelson, Li Xiao, Ling Lu, Curt H. Hagedorn, ","Antiviral Research, Volume 89, Issue 1, January 2011, Pages 54-63, ","Major progress has been made in developing infectious HCV cell culture systems and these systems have been useful in identifying novel HCV antivirals. However, more rapid and sensitive assays using infectious cell based HCV systems would facilitate the development of additional antivirals, including small molecules directed at unique targets such as the HCV RNA internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). We have found that the V3 region (28 aa) of NS5A of HCV JFH1 can be deleted from the genome with only modest effects on the titer of infectious virus produced in cell culture. Moreover, the V3 region can be replaced with the Renilla reniformis luciferase (Rluc) gene resulting in an infectious virus that stably expresses an NS5A每Rluc fusion protein. Infected cells cultured in 96-well plates provided a robust luciferase signal that accurately reflected the production of infectious virus. This infectious HCV reporter system was used to test the activity of three benzimidazole compounds that bind the HCV RNA IRES. Compounds in this chemical class of small molecules bind and alter the IRES RNA structure at low to sub-micromolar concentrations and interfere with viral replication. The current study shows that these compounds inhibit HCV replication in an infectious HCV cell culture system, defines their IC50 in this system, and provides a platform for the rapid testing of next generation inhibitors."
Worldwide trends in blood pressure from 1975 to 2015: a pooled analysis of 1479 population-based measurement studies with 19﹞1 million participants,"NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC), ","The Lancet, Volume 389, Issue 10064, 7每13 January 2017, Pages 37-55, ","Raised blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher.For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure.We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19﹞1 million adults. Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127﹞0 mm Hg (95% credible interval 125﹞7每128﹞3) in men and 122﹞3 mm Hg (121﹞0每123﹞6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78﹞7 mm Hg (77﹞9每79﹞5) for men and 76﹞7 mm Hg (75﹞9每77﹞6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24﹞1% (21﹞4每27﹞1) in men and 20﹞1% (17﹞8每22﹞5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest worldwide blood pressure in 1975 to the lowest in 2015. Mean blood pressure also decreased in women in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and, more recently, central Asia, Middle East, and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these super-regions had larger uncertainty than in high-income super-regions. By contrast, mean blood pressure might have increased in east and southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, central and eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia had the highest blood pressure levels. Prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in high-income and some middle-income countries; it remained unchanged elsewhere. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1﹞13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income countries. The global increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure is a net effect of increase due to population growth and ageing, and decrease due to declining age-specific prevalence.During the past four decades, the highest worldwide blood pressure levels have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa due to opposite trends, while blood pressure has been persistently high in central and eastern Europe.Wellcome Trust."

However, clinicians continue to debate the clinical effectiveness of this tool.Prospective analysis of data from the International Surgical Outcomes Study (ISOS), an international observational study of elective in-patient surgery, accompanied by a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature. The exposure was surgical safety checklist use. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the secondary outcome was postoperative complications. In the ISOS cohort, a multivariable multi-level generalized linear model was used to test associations. To further contextualise these findings, we included the results from the ISOS cohort in a meta-analysis. Results are reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.We included 44 814 patients from 497 hospitals in 27 countries in the ISOS analysis. There were 40 245 (89.8%) patients exposed to the checklist, whilst 7508 (16.8%) sustained ≡1 postoperative complications and 207 (0.5%) died before hospital discharge. Checklist exposure was associated with reduced mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0.49 (0.32每0.77); P<0.01], but no difference in complication rates [OR 1.02 (0.88每1.19); P=0.75]. In a systematic review, we screened 3732 records and identified 11 eligible studies of 453 292 patients including the ISOS cohort.

"Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990每2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015","GBD 2015 Risk Factors Collaborators, ","The Lancet, Volume 388, Issue 10053, 8每14 October 2016, Pages 1659-1724, ","The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. By providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context.We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors〞the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a Socio-demographic Index (SDI).Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking each decreased by more than 25%. Global exposure for several occupational risks, high body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased by more than 25% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57﹞8% (95% CI 56﹞6每58﹞8) of global deaths and 41﹞2% (39﹞8每42﹞8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure (211﹞8 million [192﹞7 million to 231﹞1 million] global DALYs), smoking (148﹞6 million [134﹞2 million to 163﹞1 million]), high fasting plasma glucose (143﹞1 million [125﹞1 million to 163﹞5 million]), high BMI (120﹞1 million [83﹞8 million to 158﹞4 million]), childhood undernutrition (113﹞3 million [103﹞9 million to 123﹞4 million]), ambient particulate matter (103﹞1 million [90﹞8 million to 115﹞1 million]), high total cholesterol (88﹞7 million [74﹞6 million to 105﹞7 million]), household air pollution (85﹞6 million [66﹞7 million to 106﹞1 million]), alcohol use (85﹞0 million [77﹞2 million to 93﹞0 million]), and diets high in sodium (83﹞0 million [49﹞3 million to 127﹞5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted DALY rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with SDI; low physical activity, high BMI, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, metabolic risks, such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa.Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be invariant to SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable DALYs, even as exposure is declining. Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation."

In this exploratory two-dimensional investigation, the lamina cribrosa is modeled as a poroelastic material where blood vessels are viewed as pores in a solid elastic matrix. The model is used to investigate the influence on the distributions of stress, blood volume fraction (or vascular porosity) and blood velocity within the lamina cribrosa due to the application of different levels of the intraocular pressure (IOP) and the enforcement of different mechanical constraints at the lamina＊s boundary. The model simulations suggest that the degree of fixity of the boundary constraint strongly influences the lamina＊s response to IOP elevation. Specifically, when the boundary is mechanically clamped, IOP elevation leads to an increase in stress close to the lamina＊s boundary, making it more susceptible to tissue damage. On the other hand, when rotations are allowed at the boundary, the most vulnerable region appears to be located at the lamina＊s central axis, in proximity of the eye globe, where increased stress and reduced vascular porosity and blood velocity are predicted for increased levels of IOP."

Although many studies use different types of polymers as carriers to prepare Ptx-loaded polymeric nanoparticles, the relatively low loading efficiency of Ptx-loaded polymeric nanoparticles significantly limits its application. Here, we design and synthesize a simple conjugation of Ptx and succinic acid (Ptx-SA), which can self-assemble into nanofibers and become ※carrier-free§ with Ptx as the drug carrier. The highest loading efficiency of Ptx is 89.5% with a controlled release pattern. The cellular uptake study indicates the internalization of Ptx-SA nanofibers by A549 cells. The in vitro cytotoxicity test results indicate that Ptx-SA nanofibers were much more effective in inhibiting the proliferation of A549 cells than free Ptx, particularly at the lower working concentration. The clonogenic assay shows the enhanced effect of Ptx-SA in ameliorating the clonogenic abilities of A549 cells compared with the equivalent dose of free Ptx. Moreover, Ptx-SA significantly attenuates the expression of p-Akt and increases the expression of cleaved PARP and Caspase-3 compared to the equivalent dose of free Ptx, which demonstrates the enhanced apoptosis-inducing effect of Ptx-SA. The animal study demonstrates the superior antitumor effect of Ptx-SA compared to free Ptx. Therefore, the conjugation of Ptx with SA enables the self-assembly of Ptx-loaded nanofibers with stronger in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects, which is a promising method to improve the therapeutic efficacy of Ptx in treating lung cancer.The efficient delivery of Ptx by nanofibers into cancer cells to induce apoptosis by regulating the expression of p-Akt and related apoptotic proteins.Download high-res image (100KB)Download full-size image"
Photochemistry of an unusual exsudatinite in Permian Basin shales,"Charles R. Landis, Shubhra Gangopadhyay, Walter L. Borst, ","Chemical Geology, Volume 93, Issues 1每2, 25 November 1991, Pages 111-128, ","An unusual variety of exsudatinite is found in four Middle Paleozoic shales of the Permian Basin. Its strong blue to blue-green (竹max = 450每470 nm) fluorescence highlights it prominently along sedimentary bedding partings and microfractures. Unlike most primary liptinites, fluorescence spectra of this microfracture exsudatinite are characterized by additional structure in the form of competitive peaks in the green wavelengths (480每500 nm) and a broad secondary structure in the yellow wavelengths. Subtle flow structures are common along the extent of the maceral which may reach maximum widths of approximately 10 米m and lengths of 100 米m. Time-resolved fluorescence data indicate a complex fluorescence of several nanosecond and sub-nanosecond lifetimes. Unperturbed fluorescence lifetimes (3.0每7.4 ns) are significant in Woodford and Wolfcamp shales, but are minor or absent in Atoka and Canyon Group shales. These lifetimes are interpreted to represent aromatics and heteroaromatics (3每5 rings) in relatively unperturbed fluorescence microenvironments where the radiative rates are high. In contrast, two other groups of shorter lifetimes suggest that the natural decays of molecules are influenced by photochemical interactions that are shorter than natural fluorescence decay. We speculate that intermediate lifetimes (1.3每2.6 ns) indicate charge transfer perturbations to various degrees by peripheral electron-donating functionals. These exciplexes represent the inter- and intramolecular transfer of non-bonded electrons from ground state donors to proximal and coplanar excited acceptors. The shortest lifetimes (●0.30 ns) may be ascribed to several processes that severely perturb the fluorescence."

This algorithm successfully deals with the difficulties associated with the ※added mass effect§, which is known to be the cause of numerical instabilities in fluid每structure interaction problems involving fluid and structure of comparable densities. Our algorithm is based on a time-discretization via operator splitting which is applied, in a novel way, to separate the fluid sub-problem from the structure elastodynamics sub-problem. In contrast with traditional loosely-coupled schemes, no iterations are necessary between the fluid and structure sub-problems; this is due to the fact that our novel splitting strategy uses the ※added mass effect§ to stabilize rather than to destabilize the numerical algorithm. This stabilizing effect is obtained by employing the kinematic lateral boundary condition to establish a tight link between the velocities of the fluid and of the structure in each sub-problem. The stability of the scheme is discussed on a simplified benchmark problem and we use energy arguments to show that the proposed scheme is unconditionally stable. Due to the crucial role played by the kinematic lateral boundary condition, the proposed algorithm is named the ※kinematically coupled scheme§."

A Syndromic Neurodevelopmental Disorder Caused by De Novo Variants in EBF3,"Hsiao-Tuan Chao, Mariska Davids, Elizabeth Burke, John G. Pappas, May Christine V. Malicdan, ","The American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 100, Issue 1, 5 January 2017, Pages 128-137, ","Early B cell factor 3 (EBF3) is a member of the highly evolutionarily conserved Collier/Olf/EBF (COE) family of transcription factors. Prior studies on invertebrate and vertebrate animals have shown that EBF3 homologs are essential for survival and that loss-of-function mutations are associated with a range of nervous system developmental defects, including perturbation of neuronal development and migration. Interestingly, aristaless-related homeobox (ARX), a homeobox-containing transcription factor critical for the regulation of nervous system development, transcriptionally represses EBF3 expression. However, human neurodevelopmental disorders related to EBF3 have not been reported. Here, we describe three individuals who are affected by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and expressive speech disorder and carry de novo variants in EBF3. Associated features seen in these individuals include congenital hypotonia, structural CNS malformations, ataxia, and genitourinary abnormalities. The de novo variants affect a single conserved residue in a zinc finger motif crucial for DNA binding and are deleterious in a fly model. Our findings indicate that mutations in EBF3 cause a genetic neurodevelopmental syndrome and suggest that loss of EBF3 function might mediate a subset of neurologic phenotypes shared by ARX-related disorders, including intellectual disability, abnormal genitalia, and structural CNS malformations."
IRF2BPL Is Associated with Neurological Phenotypes,"Paul C. Marcogliese, Vandana Shashi, Rebecca C. Spillmann, Nicholas Stong, Loren D. M.

Currently the biological function of this gene is obscure, and the gene has not been associated with a Mendelian disease. Here we describe seven individuals who carry damaging heterozygous variants in IRF2BPL and are affected with neurological symptoms. Five individuals who carry IRF2BPL nonsense variants resulting in a premature stop codon display severe neurodevelopmental regression, hypotonia, progressive ataxia, seizures, and a lack of coordination. Two additional individuals, both with missense variants, display global developmental delay and seizures and a relatively milder phenotype than those with nonsense alleles. The IRF2BPL bioinformatics signature based on population genomics is consistent with a gene that is intolerant to variation. We show that the fruit-fly IRF2BPL ortholog, called pits (protein interacting with Ttk69 and Sin3A), is broadly detected, including in the nervous system. Complete loss of pits is lethal early in development, whereas partial knockdown with RNA interference in neurons leads to neurodegeneration, revealing a requirement for this gene in proper neuronal function and maintenance. The identified IRF2BPL nonsense variants behave as severe loss-of-function alleles in this model organism, and ectopic expression of the missense variants leads to a range of phenotypes. Taken together, our results show that IRF2BPL and pits are required in the nervous system in humans and flies, and their loss leads to a range of neurological phenotypes in both species."

Placental mammalian target of rapamycin and related signaling pathways in an ovine model of intrauterine growth restriction,"Juan A. Arroyo, Laura D. Brown, Henry L. Galan, ","American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Volume 201, Issue 6, December 2009, Pages 616.e1-616.e7, ","Both phosphorylated (p) mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K) are known to regulate protein synthesis and are affected during intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). We studied the mTOR pathway during hyperthermia (HT)-induced IUGR in sheep.Beginning at 40 days gestational age, 4 ewes were exposed to HT for 55 days and 4 were exposed for 80 days to induce IUGR. Western blot analyses were performed for mTOR, p70S6K, 4E-binding protein 1, extracellularly regulated kinase (ERK), and AKT.HT animals showed: smaller fetuses and placentas near term; reduced placental weight at midgestation; increased p-mTOR, p-ERK, and p-AKT; decreased p70S6K in the near-term cotyledons; decreased p- p70S6K; and increased p-ERK in the caruncles (maternal) near term.Near-term IUGR ovine cotyledons showed up-regulation of p-mTOR, whereas p70S6K was decreased. This suggests that the changes in placental mTOR signaling proteins could be driven by the fetal stress observed near term in this model of IUGR."
Primary lymphoma of the nose including a relationship to lethal midline granuloma,"Berkley S. Eichel, Edgar G. Harrison, Kenneth D. Devine, Paul W. Scanlon, Henry A. Brown, ","The American Journal of Surgery, Volume 112, Issue 4, October 1966, Pages 597-605, ","From 1933 through 1962 thirty-three patients who had nasal lymphoreticular lesions previously diagnosed as lymphoma were seen at the Mayo Clinic. Of the thirty-three patients twenty-three were men and ten were women. Their ages ranged from twenty-five to seventysix years and 70 per cent were more than forty years of age. The most frequent complaints were progressive nasal obstruction and nasal, facial, or orbital swelling. The nasal involvement was bilateral in 27 per cent of the cases.Cell types of twenty-four lesions were those of typical lymphoma and those of nine lesions had a polymorphocellular composition. The growths exhibiting typical lymphoma cell types more often grossly tumorous and symptomatically of shorter duration, while the polymorphic type was more frequently ulcerative and had longer prodromata of nasal symptomatology in many cases.Radiotherapy was the treatment of choice. The five year survival rate in the thirty-three cases was 56.7 per cent and the ten year survival rate, 34.8 per cent. Patients having stage I lesions without extension to neighboring sinuses, orbit, or pharynx did much better than those with this extension or patients with stage II involvement. The most striking feature of our study was that the five year survival rate of the twenty-four patients with typical lymphoma in stage I was 41.2 per cent with an over-all survival rate of 38.1 per cent while all nine patients with polymorphic lesions survived five or more years. A relationship may exist between these nine polymorphic lesions and certain lesions reported as lethal midline granuloma, although polymorphic reticulosis is suggested as a more descriptive morphologic term."
Moving force identification based on modified preconditioned conjugate gradient method,"Zhen Chen, Tommy H. T. Chan, Andy Nguyen, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, Volume 423, 9 June 2018, Pages 100-117, ","This paper develops a modified preconditioned conjugate gradient (M-PCG) method for moving force identification (MFI) by improving the conjugate gradient (CG) and preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) methods with a modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm. The method aims to obtain more accurate and more efficient identification results from the responses of bridge deck caused by vehicles passing by, which are known to be sensitive to ill-posed problems that exist in the inverse problem. A simply supported beam model with biaxial time-varying forces is used to generate numerical simulations with various analysis scenarios to assess the effectiveness of the method. Evaluation results show that regularization matrix L and number of iterations j are very important influence factors to identification accuracy and noise immunity of M-PCG. Compared with the conventional counterpart SVD embedded in the time domain method (TDM) and the standard form of CG, the M-PCG with proper regularization matrix has many advantages such as better adaptability and more robust to ill-posed problems. More importantly, it is shown that the average optimal numbers of iterations of M-PCG can be reduced by more than 70% compared with PCG and this apparently makes M-PCG a preferred choice for field MFI applications."

But the protective effects and underlining mechanisms of BYHW remain unclear.This study was designed to investigate the protective effects and underlining signaling mechanisms of BYHW on brain tissues in a rat model of cerebral ischemic reperfusion (I/R) injury.Liquid chromatography was used to verify the composition of BYHW. The cerebral edema and infarct volume were measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The morphology and ultrastructure of ischemic penumbra brain tissues were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The expression levels of HIF-1 汐, VEGF and 汕-ENaC were tested using immunohistochemistry technique, western blot and quantitative PCR analysis, respectively.Administration of BYHW significantly decreased cerebral edema, rat neurological function scores, reduced brain infarct volume. At the same time, BYHW had protective effect on the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which improved the morphology and ultrastructure of ischemic penumbra brain tissues. BYHW treatment significantly decreased the protein and mRNA levels of HIF-1 汐 and VEGF compared with the model treatment. In addition, BYHW treatment significantly up-regulated the protein and mRNA levels of 汕-ENaC.BYHW protected against cerebral I/R injury in MCAO rats through inhibiting the activation of the HIF-1 汐 /VEGF pathway and stabilizing ion channel of 汕-ENaC in brain, indicating that BYHW shows potential for stroke treatment in acute stage.Download high-res image (203KB)Download full-size image"
Next-Generation Molecular Testing of Newborn Dried Blood Spots for Cystic Fibrosis,"Martina I. Lefterova, Peidong Shen, Justin I. Odegaard, Eula Fung, Curt Scharfe, ","The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, Volume 18, Issue 2, March 2016, Pages 267-282, ","Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis enables early detection and management of this debilitating genetic disease. Implementing comprehensive CFTR analysis using Sanger sequencing as a component of confirmatory testing of all screen-positive newborns has remained impractical due to relatively lengthy turnaround times and high cost. Here, we describe CFseq, a highly sensitive, specific, rapid (<3 days), and cost-effective assay for comprehensive CFTR gene analysis from dried blood spots, the common newborn screening specimen. The unique design of CFseq integrates optimized dried blood spot sample processing, a novel multiplex amplification method from as little as 1 ng of genomic DNA, and multiplex next-generation sequencing of 96 samples in a single run to detect all relevant CFTR mutation types. Sequence data analysis utilizes publicly available software supplemented by an expert-curated compendium of >2000 CFTR variants. Validation studies across 190 dried blood spots demonstrated 100% sensitivity and a positive predictive value of 100% for single-nucleotide variants and insertions and deletions and complete concordance across the polymorphic poly-TG and consecutive poly-T tracts. Additionally, we accurately detected both a known exon 2,3 deletion and a previously undetected exon 22,23 deletion. CFseq is thus able to replace all existing CFTR molecular assays with a single robust, definitive assay at significant cost and time savings and could be adapted to high-throughput screening of other inherited conditions."
Automatic age estimation based on deep learning algorithm,"Yuan Dong, Yinan Liu, Shiguo Lian, ","Neurocomputing, Volume 187, 26 April 2016, Pages 4-10, ","Automatic age estimation has attracted much attention due to its potential applications. Most of the proposed approaches have mainly used low-level handcraft features to encode facial age related visual information and train an age estimation model. In this paper, we focus on age classification task in which face image is assigned to a label that represents an age range. We proposed a deep learning based framework for age classification task. In our proposed algorithm, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (Deep ConvNets) are used to extract high-level complex age related visual features and predict age range of input face image. Due to lack of age labeled face images, we use the transfer learning strategy to train the Deep ConvNets. In addition, to describe the relationships between labels that compose an ordered sequence, we define a new loss function in the training process of age classification task. The experiments are conducted on a widely used age estimation dataset-Images of Groups of People. The experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our proposed algorithm against the state-of-the-art methods."

"Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 315 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE), 1990每2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015","GBD 2015 DALYs and HALE Collaborators, ","The Lancet, Volume 388, Issue 10053, 8每14 October 2016, Pages 1603-1658, ","Healthy life expectancy (HALE) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) provide summary measures of health across geographies and time that can inform assessments of epidemiological patterns and health system performance, help to prioritise investments in research and development, and monitor progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We aimed to provide updated HALE and DALYs for geographies worldwide and evaluate how disease burden changes with development.We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost (YLLs) and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) for each geography, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using the Sullivan method, which draws from age-specific death rates and YLDs per capita. We then assessed how observed levels of DALYs and HALE differed from expected trends calculated with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator constructed from measures of income per capita, average years of schooling, and total fertility rate.Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2015, with decreases in communicable, neonatal, maternal, and nutritional (Group 1) disease DALYs offset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Much of this epidemiological transition was caused by changes in population growth and ageing, but it was accelerated by widespread improvements in SDI that also correlated strongly with the increasing importance of NCDs. Both total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most Group 1 causes significantly decreased by 2015, and although total burden climbed for the majority of NCDs, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined. Nonetheless, age-standardised DALY rates due to several high-burden NCDs (including osteoarthritis, drug use disorders, depression, diabetes, congenital birth defects, and skin, oral, and sense organ diseases) either increased or remained unchanged, leading to increases in their relative ranking in many geographies. From 2005 to 2015, HALE at birth increased by an average of 2﹞9 years (95% uncertainty interval 2﹞9每3﹞0) for men and 3﹞5 years (3﹞4每3﹞7) for women, while HALE at age 65 years improved by 0﹞85 years (0﹞78每0﹞92) and 1﹞2 years (1﹞1每1﹞3), respectively. Rising SDI was associated with consistently higher HALE and a somewhat smaller proportion of life spent with functional health loss; however, rising SDI was related to increases in total disability. Many countries and territories in central America and eastern sub-Saharan Africa had increasingly lower rates of disease burden than expected given their SDI. At the same time, a subset of geographies recorded a growing gap between observed and expected levels of DALYs, a trend driven mainly by rising burden due to war, interpersonal violence, and various NCDs.Health is improving globally, but this means more populations are spending more time with functional health loss, an absolute expansion of morbidity. The proportion of life spent in ill health decreases somewhat with increasing SDI, a relative compression of morbidity, which supports continued efforts to elevate personal income, improve education, and limit fertility. Our analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework on which to benchmark geography-specific health performance and SDG progress. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform financial and research investments, prevention efforts, health policies, and health system improvement initiatives for all countries along the development continuum.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation."
Negative effects of a disulfide bond mismatch in anti-rabies G protein single-chain antibody variable fragment FV57,"Ye Duan, Tiejun Gu, Xizhen Zhang, Chunlai Jiang, Wei Kong, ","Molecular Immunology, Volume 59, Issue 2, June 2014, Pages 136-141, ","Rabies virus (RV) causes a fatal infectious disease requiring efficient post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which includes a rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). The single-chain antibody variable fragment (scFv), a small engineered antibody fragment derived from an antibody variable heavy chain and light chain, has the potential to replace the current application of RIG. In previous studies, we constructed and evaluated an anti-rabies virus G protein scFv (FV57) based on the monoclonal antibody CR57. Of the five cysteines in FV57, four are linked in intra-chain disulfide bonds (Cys-VH28/Cys-VH98 and Cys-VL16/Cys-VL84), and one is free (Cys-VL85). However, the thiol in Cys-VL85 neighboring Cys-VL84 in the CDR3 of the light chain is likely to mismatch with the thiol in Cys-VL16 during the renaturing process. In order to study effects of the mismatched disulfide bond, Cys-VL85 and Cys-VL84 of FV57 were mutated to serine to construct mutants FV57VL85S and FV57VL84S. Furthermore, the disulfide bonds in the light chain of FV57, FV57VL85S and FV57VL84S were deleted by mutating Cys-VL16 to serine. All mutants were prepared and evaluated along with the original FV57. The results indicated that the mismatched disulfide bond of FV57 linking the light chain FR1 and CDR3 would confer deleterious negative effects on its activity against RV, likely due to spatial hindrance in the light chain CDR3. Moreover, avoidance of the disulfide bond mismatch provided an additional 30% protective efficacy against RV infection in the mouse RV challenge model. Thus, modifications of FV57 to eliminate the disulfide bond mismatch may provide a candidate therapeutic agent for effective PEP against rabies."

Dabigatran prevents perioperative venous thromboembolism, but whether this drug can prevent a broader range of vascular complications in patients with MINS is unknown. The MANAGE trial assessed the potential of dabigatran to prevent major vascular complications among such patients.In this international, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients from 84 hospitals in 19 countries. Eligible patients were aged at least 45 years, had undergone non-cardiac surgery, and were within 35 days of MINS. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive dabigatran 110 mg orally twice daily or matched placebo for a maximum of 2 years or until termination of the trial and, using a partial 2-by-2 factorial design, patients not taking a proton-pump inhibitor were also randomly assigned (1:1) to omeprazole 20 mg once daily, for which results will be reported elsewhere, or matched placebo to measure its effect on major upper gastrointestinal complications. Research personnel randomised patients through a central 24 h computerised randomisation system using block randomisation, stratified by centre. Patients, health-care providers, data collectors, and outcome adjudicators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy outcome was the occurrence of a major vascular complication, a composite of vascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-haemorrhagic stroke, peripheral arterial thrombosis, amputation, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The primary safety outcome was a composite of life-threatening, major, and critical organ bleeding. Analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01661101.Between Jan 10, 2013, and July 17, 2017, we randomly assigned 1754 patients to receive dabigatran (n=877) or placebo (n=877); 556 patients were also randomised in the omeprazole partial factorial component. Study drug was permanently discontinued in 401 (46%) of 877 patients allocated to dabigatran and 380 (43%) of 877 patients allocated to placebo. The composite primary efficacy outcome occurred in fewer patients randomised to dabigatran than placebo (97 [11%] of 877 patients assigned to dabigatran vs 133 [15%] of 877 patients assigned to placebo; hazard ratio [HR] 0﹞72, 95% CI 0﹞55每0﹞93; p=0﹞0115). The primary safety composite outcome occurred in 29 patients (3%) randomised to dabigatran and 31 patients (4%) randomised to placebo (HR 0﹞92, 95% CI 0﹞55每1﹞53; p=0﹞76).Among patients who had MINS, dabigatran 110 mg twice daily lowered the risk of major vascular complications, with no significant increase in major bleeding. Patients with MINS have a poor prognosis; dabigatran 110 mg twice daily has the potential to help many of the 8 million adults globally who have MINS to reduce their risk of a major vascular complication.Boehringer Ingelheim and Canadian Institutes of Health Research."

Operator splitting for the numerical solution of free surface flow at low capillary numbers,"Giovanna Guidoboni, Roland Glowinski, Matteo Pasquali, ","Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Volume 232, Issue 1, 1 October 2009, Pages 72-81, ","Free surface flows are pervasive in engineering and biomedical applications. In many interesting cases〞particularly when small length scales are involved〞surface forces (capillarity) dominate the flow dynamics. In these cases, computing the flow together with the shape of the surfaces, requires specialized solution techniques. This article investigates the capabilities of an operator splitting/finite elements method at handling accurately incompressible viscous flow with free surfaces at low capillary numbers. The test case of flow in the downstream section of a slot coater is used for three reasons: (1) it is an established benchmark; (2) it represents an idealized, yet industrially relevant flow; (3) high-fidelity results obtained with monolithic algorithms are available in literature. The flow and free surface shape attained with the new operator splitting scheme agree very satisfactorily with the results obtained with monolithic solvers. Because of its inherent computational simplicity, the new operator splitting scheme is attractive for large-scale simulations, three-dimensional flows, and flows of complex fluids."

Energy-based operator splitting approach for the time discretization of coupled systems of partial and ordinary differential equations for fluid flows: The Stokes case,"Lucia Carichino, Giovanna Guidoboni, Marcela Szopos, ","Journal of Computational Physics, Volume 364, 1 July 2018, Pages 235-256, ","The goal of this work is to develop a novel splitting approach for the numerical solution of multiscale problems involving the coupling between Stokes equations and ODE systems, as often encountered in blood flow modeling applications. The proposed algorithm is based on a semi-discretization in time based on operator splitting, whose design is guided by the rationale of ensuring that the physical energy balance is maintained at the discrete level. As a result, unconditional stability with respect to the time step choice is ensured by the implicit treatment of interface conditions within the Stokes substeps, whereas the coupling between Stokes and ODE substeps is enforced via appropriate initial conditions for each substep. Notably, unconditional stability is attained without the need of subiterating between Stokes and ODE substeps. Stability and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm are tested on three specific examples for which analytical solutions are derived."
Enhanced retention of bacteria by TiO2 nanoparticles in saturated porous media,"Guillermina J. Gentile, Mar赤a M.

Sand column breakthrough curves were obtained for single and combined suspensions, at four different ionic strengths. DLVO and classical filtration theories were employed to model the interactions between particles and between particles and sand grains. Attachment of TiO2 to the sand was explained by electrostatic forces and these nanoparticles acted as bonds between the bacteria and the sand, leading to retention. Presence of TiO2 significantly increased the retention of bacteria in the sand bed, but microorganisms were released when nanomaterial influx ceased. The inclusion of nanomaterials in saturated porous media may have implications for the design and operation of sand filters in water treatment."

Compared with patients with no recurrent IHCA, patients with recurrent IHCA were less than half as likely to survive to discharge (12.7% vs 22.1%; adjusted OR: 0.46 [0.44-0.48], P < .001) and have favorable neurological survival (7.0% vs 13.1%; adjusted OR: 0.44 [0.42-0.47], P < .001). Compared with patients with recurrent OHCA, patients with recurrent IHCA also had lower rates of survival to discharge (12.7% vs 16.1%; adjusted OR: 0.81 [0.71-0.94], P = .005) and favorable neurological survival (7.0% vs 8.9%; adjusted OR: 0.66 [0.54-0.81], P < .001). Despite worse survival outcomes, patients with recurrent IHCA were least likely to adopt DNAR orders within the first 24 hours after successful resuscitation compared with patients with no recurrent IHCA or recurrent OHCA (17.2% vs 18.9% and 26.6%, respectively) or withdraw care at any time (17.7% vs 24.4% and 31.2%, respectively).Nearly 1 in 8 patients with an IHCA has a recurrent IHCA, and these patients have worse outcomes than patients with only a single IHCA and those with an IHCA after being hospitalized for an OHCA. Despite worse survival, rates of DNAR and withdrawal of care were lowest for patients with recurrent IHCA. These findings provide important prognostic information for clinicians caring for patients with recurrent IHCA and suggest the need to better align resuscitation and end-of-life decisions with patients' prognoses after IHCA."

Chapter 8: Fiber-Based Sensors: Enabling Next-Generation Ubiquitous Textile Systems,"Michael McKnight, Talha Agcayazi, Tushar Ghosh, Alper Bozkurt, ","Wearable Technology in Medicine and Health Care, 2018, Pages 153-171, ","One of the grand challenges of producing truly ubiquitous textile wearable systems is the development of sensors, actuators, and interconnects, which can be seamlessly integrated into textiles using traditional textile manufacturing techniques while not disrupting the primary functions of clothing, for example, comfort. In order to be adapted on a large-scale within the textile industries, such components should be compatible with traditional textile materials (fibers, yarns, and fabric) in physical and mechanical properties, and would ideally be produced using conventional textile processing methods. The development of a fiber capable of sensing multiple parameters enables facile integration of sensing elements into textile substrates, which can provide spatial sensor information across the surface of a textile. Additionally, sensing fibers and fabrics can be tailored to sense different parameters of interest at different locations within a textile. Prior work has demonstrated that fiber-based sensors produced using microfabrication techniques, screen printing, and 3D printing methods can enable sensing of multiple physiological parameters including biopotentials, pressure, and wetness. Here, we also discuss other sensing methods, which could be implemented using fibers and fibrous structures, and explore the challenges to producing such devices/systems such that they are robust enough for use in textile applications."
A truncated generalized singular value decomposition algorithm for moving force identification with ill-posed problems,"Zhen Chen, Tommy H. T. Chan, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, Volume 401, 4 August 2017, Pages 297-310, ","This paper proposes a new methodology for moving force identification (MFI) from the responses of bridge deck. Based on the existing time domain method (TDM), the MFI problem eventually becomes solving the linear algebraic equation in the form Ax=b. The vector b is usually contaminated by an unknown error e generating from measurement error, which often called the vector e as ＆＆noise＊＊. With the ill-posed problems that exist in the inverse problem, the identification force would be sensitive to the noise e. The proposed truncated generalized singular value decomposition method (TGSVD) aims at obtaining an acceptable solution and making the noise to be less sensitive to perturbations with the ill-posed problems. The illustrated results show that the TGSVD has many advantages such as higher precision, better adaptability and noise immunity compared with TDM. In addition, choosing a proper regularization matrix L and a truncation parameter k are very useful to improve the identification accuracy and to solve ill-posed problems when it is used to identify the moving force on bridge."
Carbon monoxide signal regulates light-initiated seed germination by suppressing SOM expression,"Yujie Jia, Ruijing Li, Wenjuan Yang, Zhen Chen, Xiangyang Hu, ","Plant Science, Volume 272, July 2018, Pages 88-98, ","Light is a critical external signal for seed germination. The photoreceptor phytochrome B (PHYB) perceives light stimulation and promotes seed germination during the early phase after imbibition. SOM is a CCH-type zinc finger protein and negatively regulates PHYB-mediated seed germination by controlling downstream gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) metabolism. As a small molecular signal, carbon monoxide (CO) has been reported to regulate seed germination under environmental stress, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we first found that CO enhanced PHYB-dependent seed germination, and red light irradiation increased the transcriptional level of gene encoding Heme oxygenase 1(HY1) for CO production, this process required PHYB. Pharmacological and genetic analyses revealed that CO signals repressed the transcriptional level of SOM to alter downstream GA/ABA metabolism related genes expression, ultimately relieving the inhibitory effect of SOM on seed germination. Furthermore, CO signals possibly recruited histone deacetylase 6 (HDA6) to the promoter region of SOM to decrease its expression by diminishing histone H3 acetylation levels at this locus. Taken together, our results propose a novel mechanism for CO signals in promoting light-initiated seed germination via recruiting HDA6 to epigenetically regulate SOM expression.Download high-res image (34KB)Download full-size image"
Adaptive Cascade Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for face alignment,"Yuan Dong, Yue Wu, ","Computer Standards & Interfaces, Volume 42, November 2015, Pages 105-112, ","Deep convolutional network cascade has been successfully applied for face alignment. The configuration of each network, including the selecting strategy of local patches for training and the input range of local patches, is crucial for achieving desired performance. In this paper, we propose an adaptive cascade framework, termed Adaptive Cascade Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ACDCNN) which adjusts the cascade structure adaptively. Gaussian distribution is utilized to bridge the successive networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ACDCNN achieves the state-of-the-art in accuracy, but with reduced model complexity and increased robustness."
High pregnancy anxiety during mid-gestation is associated with decreased gray matter density in 6每9-year-old children,"Claudia Buss, Elysia Poggi Davis, L. Tugan Muftuler, Kevin Head, Curt A. Sandman, ","Psychoneuroendocrinology, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 2010, Pages 141-153, ","Because the brain undergoes dramatic changes during fetal development it is vulnerable to environmental insults. There is evidence that maternal stress and anxiety during pregnancy influences birth outcome but there are no studies that have evaluated the influence of stress during human pregnancy on brain morphology. In the current prospective longitudinal study we included 35 women for whom serial data on pregnancy anxiety was available at 19 (㊣0.83), 25 (㊣0.9) and 31 (㊣0.9) weeks gestation. When the offspring from the target pregnancy were between 6 and 9 years of age, their neurodevelopmental stage was assessed by a structural MRI scan. With the application of voxel-based morphometry, we found regional reductions in gray matter density in association with pregnancy anxiety after controlling for total gray matter volume, age, gestational age at birth, handedness and postpartum perceived stress. Specifically, independent of postnatal stress, pregnancy anxiety at 19 weeks gestation was associated with gray matter volume reductions in the prefrontal cortex, the premotor cortex, the medial temporal lobe, the lateral temporal cortex, the postcentral gyrus as well as the cerebellum extending to the middle occipital gyrus and the fusiform gyrus. High pregnancy anxiety at 25 and 31 weeks gestation was not significantly associated with local reductions in gray matter volume.This is the first prospective study to show that a specific temporal pattern of pregnancy anxiety is related to specific changes in brain morphology. Altered gray matter volume in brain regions affected by prenatal maternal anxiety may render the developing individual more vulnerable to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders as well as cognitive and intellectual impairment."
Baicalin attenuates in vivo and in vitro hyperglycemia-exacerbated ischemia/reperfusion injury by regulating mitochondrial function in a manner dependent on AMPK,"Shanshan Li, Xiaoxu Sun, Lixing Xu, Ruoxi Sun, Shiping Ma, ","European Journal of Pharmacology, Volume 815, 15 November 2017, Pages 118-126, ","Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is a lethal and disabling disease. Studies have suggested that hyperglycemia is a risk factor for cerebral I/R. Baicalin is a natural bioactive flavonoid extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi with neuroprotective activity. In the present study, we investigated the effects of baicalin on hyperglycemia-exacerbated cerebral I/R injury. Streptozotocin (STZ) injection aggravated the brain damage induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery, while baicalin administration reduced blood glucose, relieved neurological deficit and decreased infarct volume. In vitro, Oxygen-glucose deprivation/ reperfusion (OGD/REP) induced inordinate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dynamic impairments were markedly increased under high glucose (HG) condition. Baicalin treatment in PC12 cells inhibited dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) expression, decreased mitochondrial fission, promoted mitofusin-2 (MFN2) generation, increased Drp-1 Ser637 phosphorylation, and elevated mitochondrial membrane potential (忖肉m) via the suppression of ROS production. However, AMPK汐1 knockdown abolished the protective effects of baicalin. Baicalin also suppressed cell apoptosis and enhanced mitophagy. These results suggested that baicalin protected against hyperglycemia aggravated I/R injury by regulating mitochondrial functions in a manner dependent on AMPK."
Quercetin attenuates tau hyperphosphorylation and improves cognitive disorder via suppression of ER stress in a manner dependent on AMPK pathway,"Junjun Chen, Xueyang Deng, Ning Liu, Min Li, Shiping Ma, ","Journal of Functional Foods, Volume 22, April 2016, Pages 463-476, ","Quercetin, a natural flavonoid abundantly found in onions, apples, tea, berries, cauliflower, and red wine, has been demonstrated to exert beneficial effect on Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to investigate its AMPK activity on hyperphosphorylation of tau and explore the underlying mechanism associated with Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Quercetin and quercetin-3-O-glucuronide suppressed ER stress with decreased phosphorylation of IRE1汐 and PERK, thereby inhibited TXNIP and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, ultimately attenuated tau phosphorylation in okadaic acid (OA) induced SH-SY5Y cells. However, the effect on tau phosphorylation was blocked by downregulation of AMPK汐1/2 with SiRNA transfection. Moreover, administration of quercetin enhanced AMPK activity, inhibited IRE1汐 and PERK phosphorylation, NLRP3 expression and tau phosphorylation and improved cognitive disorder in mice exposed to high fat diets. AMPK may be a key player that links ER stress and tau phosphorylation and mediates quercetin's effect on cognitive disorder. Thus, quercetin and its AMPK activity may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of AD patients."
Brain morphometry on congenital hand deformities based on Teichm邦ller space theory,"Hao Peng, Xu Wang, Ye Duan, Scott H. Frey, Xianfeng Gu, ","Computer-Aided Design, Volume 58, January 2015, Pages 84-91, ","Congenital Hand Deformities (CHD) usually occurred between the fourth and the eighth week after the embryo is formed. Failure of the transformation from arm bud cells to upper limb can lead to an abnormal appearing/functioning upper extremity which is presented at birth. Some causes are linked to genetics while others are affected by the environment, and the rest have remained unknown. CHD patients develop prehension through the use of their hands, which affects the brain as time passes. In recent years, CHD have gained increasing attention and researches have been conducted on CHD, both surgically and psychologically. However, the impacts of CHD on the brain structure are not well-understood so far. Here, we propose a novel approach to apply Teichm邦ller space theory and conformal welding method to study brain morphometry in CHD patients. Conformal welding signature reflects the geometric relations among different functional areas on the cortex surface, which is intrinsic to the Riemannian metric, invariant under conformal deformation, and encodes complete information of the functional area boundaries. The computational algorithm is based on discrete surface Ricci flow, which has theoretic guarantees for the existence and uniqueness of the solutions. In practice, discrete Ricci flow is equivalent to a convex optimization problem, therefore has high numerically stability. In this paper, we compute the signatures of contours on general 3D surfaces with the surface Ricci flow method, which encodes both global and local surface contour information. Then we evaluated the signatures of pre-central and post-central gyrus on healthy control and CHD subjects for analyzing brain cortical morphometry. Preliminary experimental results from 3D MRI data of CHD/control data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The statistical comparison between left and right brain gives us a better understanding on brain morphometry of subjects with Congenital Hand Deformities, in particular, missing the distal part of the upper limb."

A materials-science approach to understanding limestone-tempered pottery from the Midwestern United States,"Robert J. Hoard, Michael J. O'Brien, Mohammad Ghazavy Khorasgany, Vellore S. Gopalaratnam, ","Journal of Archaeological Science, Volume 22, Issue 6, November 1995, Pages 823-832, ","Limestone temper is common in Late Woodland period pottery from the central United States. Calcium carbonate in the mineral form of calcite, the predominant component of limestone, makes sticky clay more workable, but it also causes pots to spall if fired over 600∼C. the low end of the open-firing temperature range. A test of performance characteristics of limestone-tempered prehistoric pottery replicates demonstrates that they are significantly more resistant to mechanical stress than are grit-or grog-tempered replicates fired to 600∼C. Limestone-tempered pottery, also appears to be more resistant to thermal shock because the calcium carbonate allows for thinner vessels to be made and possibly because the expansion rate of calcite is very similar to that of clay. Some effort must have been taken by prehistoric potters to overcome the spalling produced by limestone temper, suggesting that the inclusion of limestone was a technological shift requiring refinement of pottery-manufacturing techniques."
On the characterization of flexural toughness in fiber reinforced concretes,"Vellore S.

Gopalaratnam, ","Cement and Concrete Research, Volume 23, Issue 6, November 1993, Pages 1455-1466, ","The article discusses issues related to the accuracy of deflection measurement in the flexural testing of fiber reinforced concrete. It is observed that the ASTM and the old ACI toughness indices which are based on measuring deflection at first cracking are influenced significantly by errors in the deflection measurement. This is primarily because up to first-crack, these errors often overshadow true first-crack deflections. Errors in deflection measurement result in negligible errors in toughness computations using either the JCI definition of flexural toughness or the new ACI definition of toughness index. Elastic punching deformation at the specimen support has been identified as a major source of the extraneous deformation. Approximate equations to predict this deformation have been presented. The elasticity-based equations are more realistically sensitive to specimen size and material properties than similar equations obtained using plasticity concepts."
Chediak-Higashi syndrome: Lysosomal trafficking regulator domains regulate exocytosis of lytic granules but not cytokine secretion by natural killer cells,"Aleksandra Gil-Krzewska, Stephanie M.

Our understanding of NK cell function deficiency in patients with CHS and how LYST regulates lytic granule exocytosis is very limited.We sought to delineate cellular defects associated with LYST mutations responsible for the impaired NK cell function seen in patients with CHS.We analyzed NK cells from patients with CHS with missense mutations in the LYST ARM/HEAT (armadillo/huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, and the yeast kinase TOR1) or BEACH (beige and Chediak-Higashi) domains.NK cells from patients with CHS displayed severely reduced cytotoxicity. Mutations in the ARM/HEAT domain led to a reduced number of perforin-containing granules, which were significantly increased in size but able to polarize to the immunologic synapse; however, they were unable to properly fuse with the plasma membrane. Mutations in the BEACH domain resulted in formation of normal or slightly enlarged granules that had markedly impaired polarization to the IS but could be exocytosed on reaching the immunologic synapse. Perforin-containing granules in NK cells from patients with CHS did not acquire certain lysosomal markers (lysosome-associated membrane protein 1/2) but were positive for markers of transport vesicles (cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor), late endosomes (Ras-associated binding protein 27a), and, to some extent, early endosomes (early endosome antigen 1), indicating a lack of integrity in the endolysosomal compartments. NK cells from patients with CHS had normal cytokine compartments and cytokine secretion.LYST is involved in regulation of multiple aspects of NK cell lytic activity, ranging from governance of lytic granule size to control of their polarization and exocytosis, as well as regulation of endolysosomal compartment identity. LYST functions in the regulated exocytosis but not in the constitutive secretion pathway."

Upper extremities are typically affected later in the disease. We report a patient with GNE myopathy who presented with asymmetric hand weakness. He had considerably decreased left grip strength, atrophy of the left anterior forearm and fibro-fatty tissue replacement of left forearm flexor muscles on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The patient was an endoscopist and thus the asymmetric hand involvement may be associated with left hand overuse in daily repetitive pinching and gripping movements, highlighting the possible impact of environmental factors on the progression of genetic muscle conditions."

Your neighbors alleviate cold-start: On geographical neighborhood influence to collaborative web service QoS prediction,"Zhen Chen, Limin Shen, Feng Li, Dianlong You, ","Knowledge-Based Systems, Volume 138, 15 December 2017, Pages 188-201, ","Predicting the unknown quality of service(QoS) for an active user who has not previously accessed a Web service plays a fundamental role in supporting appropriate service selection, high quality service composition and reliable distributed system construction. Existing Web service QoS prediction methods suffer from the problems of data sparsity and cold-start, which dramatically degrade prediction accuracy and even impede their applicability in real scenarios. Additionally, the potentially positive but inconspicuous relation between geographical region and QoS rating interaction among users and Web services has been underestimated in previous studies. In contrast to those studies, we propose a collaborative Web service QoS prediction approach that incorporates the knowledge of geographical neighborhoods. By analyzing the geographical relationships in the real-world dataset WSDream, we observe that users and Web services are positively correlated with their geographical neighbors. Based on this observation, we first design a bottom up neighborhood clustering method for correlating geographical neighbor selection. Then, we construct two diversified similarity neighborhood regularization terms and systemically integrate them into a matrix factorization model, which achieves the knowledge transfer of geographical neighborhoods in improving QoS prediction accuracy. Experimental results have demonstrated that our approach performs more efficiently than existing methods with respect to accuracy, as well as alleviating the data sparsity and cold-start issues."

The aim of this study was to identify the shape differences of the corpus callosum between patients with autism and control subjects. Anatomical landmarks were collected from midsagittal magnetic resonance images of 25 patients and 18 controls. Euclidean distance matrix analysis and thin-plate spline analyses were used to examine the landmark forms. Point-by-point shape comparison was performed both globally and locally. A new local shape comparison scheme was proposed which compared each part of the shape in its local coordinate system. Point correspondence was established among individual shapes based on the inherent landmark correspondence. No significant difference was found in the landmark form between patients and controls, but the distance between the interior genu and the posterior-most section was found to be significantly shorter in patients. Thin-plate spline analysis showed significant group differences between the landmark configurations in terms of the deformation from the overall mean configuration. Significant global shape differences were found in the anterior lower body and posterior bottom, and there was a local shape difference in the anterior bottom. This study can serve as both a clinical reference and a detailed procedural guideline for similar studies in the future."

Urine oligosaccharide screening by MALDI-TOF for the identification of NGLY1 deficiency,"Patricia L. Hall, Christina Lam, John J. Alexander, Ghazia Asif, Kimiyo M. Raymond, ","Molecular Genetics and Metabolism, Volume 124, Issue 1, May 2018, Pages 82-86, ","N-glycanase deficiency (NGLY1 deficiency, NGLY1-CDDG), the first autosomal recessive congenital disorder of N-linked deglycosylation (CDDG), is caused by pathogenic variants in NGLY1. The majority of affected individuals have been identified using exome or genome sequencing. To date, no reliable, clinically available biomarkers have been identified. Urine oligosaccharide analysis was included as part of a routine evaluation for possible biomarkers in patients with confirmed NGLY1-CDDG. During the qualitative review of oligosaccharide profiles by an experienced laboratory director an abnormal analyte with a proposed structure of Neu5Ac1Hex1GlcNAc1-Asn was identified in NGLY1-CDDG patient urine samples. The same species has been observed in profiles from individuals affected with aspartylglucosaminuria, although the complete spectra are not identical. Additional studies using tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the analyte's structure. In addition to the known NGLY1-CDDG patients identified by this analysis, a single case was identified in a population referred for clinical testing who subsequently had a diagnosis of NGLY1-CDDG confirmed by molecular testing. Urine oligosaccharide screening by MALDI-TOF MS can identify individuals with NGLY1-CDDG. In addition, this potential biomarker might also be used to monitor the effectiveness of therapeutic options as they become available."

We also present a summary of progress in modeling using a 1-D Lagrangian hydrodynamics code. Experimental erosion data will be reviewed from the PLADIS facility, a plasma gun at the University of New Mexico on several materials, including Be, tungsten, copper, graphites. Profile measurements of the crater topology showed the eroded Be surface to be much rougher than that of carbon and to demonstrate erosion rates that were almost factors of four greater than graphite. Plasma guns at the D.V. Efremov Scientific Research Institute and at TRINITI, both in the Russian Federation, are being utilized to confirm spectroscopic vapor shield data."
An actin cytoskeletal barrier inhibits lytic granule release from natural killer cells in patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome,"Aleksandra Gil-Krzewska, Mezida B. Saeed, Anna Oszmiana, Elizabeth R. Fischer, Konrad Krzewski, ","Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Volume 142, Issue 3, September 2018, Pages 914-927.e6, ","Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare disorder caused by biallelic mutations in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene (LYST), resulting in formation of giant lysosomes or lysosome-related organelles in several cell types. The disease is characterized by immunodeficiency and a fatal hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis caused by impaired function of cytotoxic lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells.We sought to determine the underlying biochemical cause of the impaired cytotoxicity of NK cells in patients with CHS.We generated a human cell model of CHS using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) technology. We used a combination of classical techniques to evaluate lysosomal function and cell activity in the model system and super-resolution microscopy to visualize F-actin and lytic granules in normal and LYST-deficient NK cells.Loss of LYST function in a human NK cell line, NK92mi, resulted in inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity and reproduced other aspects of the CHS cellular phenotype, including the presence of significantly enlarged lytic granules with defective exocytosis and impaired integrity of endolysosomal compartments. The large granules had an acidic pH and normal activity of lysosomal enzymes and were positive for the proteins essential for lytic granule exocytosis. Visualization of the actin meshwork openings at the immunologic synapse revealed that the cortical actin acts as a barrier for secretion of such large granules at the cell-cell contact site. Decreasing the cortical actin density at the immunologic synapse or decreasing the lytic granule size restored the ability of LYST-deficient NK cells to degranulate and kill target cells.The cortical actin and granule size play significant roles in NK cell cytotoxic function. We present evidence that the periodicity of subsynaptic actin is an important factor limiting the release of large lytic granules from NK cells from patients with CHS and could be a novel target for pharmaceutical intervention."

Several extreme paths to the same point are obtained by multiple solutions of boundary value solutions. Actions along various extreme paths are calculated and associated analysis is performed in relation to the singular features of the patterns.
Children's intellectual ability is associated with structural network integrity,"Dae-Jin Kim, Elysia Poggi Davis, Curt A. Sandman, Olaf Sporns, William P. Hetrick, ","NeuroImage, Volume 124, Part A, 1 January 2016, Pages 550-556, ","Recent structural and functional neuroimaging studies of adults suggest that efficient patterns of brain connectivity are fundamental to human intelligence. Specifically, whole brain networks with an efficient small-world organization, along with specific brain regions (i.e., Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory, P-FIT) appear related to intellectual ability. However, these relationships have not been studied in children using structural network measures. This cross-sectional study examined the relation between non-verbal intellectual ability and structural network organization in 99 typically developing healthy preadolescent children. We showed a strong positive association between the network's global efficiency and intelligence, in which a subtest for visuo-spatial motor processing (Block Design, BD) was prominent in both global brain structure and local regions included within P-FIT as well as temporal regions involved with pattern and form processing. BD was also associated with rich club organization, which encompassed frontal, occipital, temporal, hippocampal, and neostriatal regions. This suggests that children's visual construction ability is significantly related to how efficiently children's brains are globally and locally integrated. Our findings indicate that visual construction and reasoning may make general demands on globally integrated processing by the brain."

MEBR exhibited significant improvement of treatment performance and reduction of membrane fouling. COD and total phenols removal efficiencies increased to 83.53% and 93.28% at an exposure mode of 24＊-OFF/6＊-ON, compared to 71.24% and 82.43% in MBR. Trans-membrane pressure increment rate declined dramatically in MEBR, which was mainly attributed to the increase of sludge floc size and decrease of zeta potential, soluble microbial products and specific resistance to filtration, resulted from electrokinetic effects such as electrocoagulation, electrophoresis, electroosmosis and electromigration of ions. It was notable that DC exposure exerted distinct evolution on microbial community, with the improvement of microbial community richness and diversity. The relative abundances of functional genera were promoted noticeably in MEBR. An interactive relevance existed among microbial community structure, mixed liquor properties and operational parameters.Download high-res image (85KB)Download full-size image"
A subdivision-based deformable model for surface reconstruction of unknown topology,"Ye Duan, Hong Qin, ","Graphical Models, Volume 66, Issue 4, July 2004, Pages 181-202, ","This paper presents a surface reconstruction algorithm that can recover correct shape geometry as well as its unknown topology from both volumetric images and unorganized point clouds. The algorithm starts from a simple seed model (of genus zero) that can be arbitrarily initiated within any datasets. The deformable behavior of the model is governed by a locally defined objective function associated with each vertex of the model. Through the numerical computation of function optimization, the algorithm can adaptively subdivide the model geometry, automatically detect self-collision of the model, properly modify its topology (because of the occurrence of self-collision), continuously evolve the model towards the object boundary, and reduce fitting error and improve fitting quality via global refinement. Commonly used mesh optimization techniques are employed throughout the geometric deformation and topological variation to ensure the model both locally smooth and globally well defined. Our experiments have demonstrated that the new modeling algorithm is valuable for iso-surface extraction in visualization, shape recovery and segmentation in medical imaging, and surface reconstruction in reverse engineering."
Mechanics of plasma exposed spin-on-glass (SOG) and polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) surfaces and their impact on bond strength,"Shantanu Bhattacharya, Yuanfang Gao, Venumadhav Korampally, M. T. Othman, Shubhra Gangopadhyay, ","Applied Surface Science, Volume 253, Issue 9, 28 February 2007, Pages 4220-4225, ","Silicone polymer (PDMS), widely used for micro-fluidic and biosensor applications, possesses an extremely dynamic surface after it is subjected to an oxygen plasma treatment process. The surface becomes extremely hydrophilic immediately after oxygen plasma exposure by developing silanol bond (SiOH), which promotes its adhesion to some other surfaces like, silicon, silicon dioxide, glass, etc. Such a surface, if left in ambient dry air, shows a gradual recovery of hydrophobicity. We have found an identical behavior to occur to surfaces coated with a thin continuous film of SOG (methyl silsesquioxane). The chemistry induced by oxygen plasma treatment of a spin-on-glass (SOG) coated surface provides a much higher density of surface silanol groups in comparison to precleaned glass, silicon or silicon dioxide substrates thus providing a higher bond strength with polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS). The bonding protocol developed by using the spin coated and cured SOG intermediate layer provides an universal regime of multi level wafer bonding of PDMS to a variety of substrates. The paper describes a contact angle based estimation of bond strength for SOG and PDMS surfaces exposed to various combinations of plasma parameters. We have found that the highest bond strength condition is achieved if the contact angle on the SOG surface is less than 10∼."
Differential susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress relates to the number of Dnmt3a-immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus,"Caroline Hammels, Jos Prickaerts, Gunter Kenis, Tim Vanmierlo, Bart P. F. Rutten, ","Psychoneuroendocrinology, Volume 51, January 2015, Pages 547-556, ","The enzyme DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) is crucially involved in DNA methylation and recent studies have demonstrated that Dnmt3a is functionally involved in mediating and moderating the impact of environmental exposures on gene expression and behavior. Findings in rodents have suggested that DNA methylation is involved in regulating neuronal proliferation and differentiation. So far, it has been shown that chronic social defeat might influence neurogenesis, while susceptibility to social defeat stress is dependent on gene expression changes in the nucleus accumbens and the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. However, the role of Dnmt3a herein has not been fully characterized. Our earlier immunohistochemical work has revealed the existence of two types of Dnmt3a-immunoreactive cells in the mouse hippocampus, of which one represents a distinct type with intense Dnmt3a-immunoreactivity (Dnmt3a type II cells) co-localizing with a marker of recent proliferation. Based on this, we hypothesize that behavioral susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress is linked to (i) Dnmt3a protein levels in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus, and (ii) to the density of Dnmt3a type II cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. While no differences were found in global levels of Dnmt3a protein expression in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus, our stereological quantifications indicated a significantly increased density of Dnmt3a type II cells in the dentate gyrus of animals resilient to social defeat stress compared to susceptible and control animals. Further characterization of the Dnmt3a type II cells revealed that these cells were mostly doublecortin (25%) or NeuN (60%) immunopositive, thus defining them as immature and mature neurons. Moreover, negative associations between the density of Dnmt3a type II cells and indices of depressive-like behavior in the sucrose intake and forced swim test were found. These correlational data suggest that DNA methylation via Dnmt3a in the hippocampus co-regulates adaptivity of the behavioral response to chronic social defeat stress, and set the stage for further experimental studies testing a mediating role of Dnmt3a in experience-dependent plasticity, neurogenesis and (mal) adaptation to severe stressors."

Correolide and Derivatives Are Novel Immunosuppressants Blocking the Lymphocyte Kv1.3 Potassium Channels,"Gloria C. Koo, Joseph T. Blake, Kashmira Shah, Mary Jo Staruch, Martin S. Springer, ","Cellular Immunology, Volume 197, Issue 2, 1 November 1999, Pages 99-107, ","The voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv1.3, is specifically expressed on human lymphocytes, where it controls membrane potential and calcium influx. Blockade of Kv1.3 channels by margatoxin was previously shown to prevent T cell activation and attenuate immune responses in vivo.

T cell activation events, such as anti-CD3-induced calcium elevation, IL-2 production, and proliferation were inhibited by correolide in a dose-dependent manner. More potent analogs were evaluated for pharmacokinetic profiles and subsequently tested in a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to tuberculin in the miniswine. Two compounds were dosed orally, iv, or im, and both compounds suppressed DTH responses, demonstrating that small molecule blockers of Kv1.3 channels can act as immunosuppressive agents in vivo.

A synthetic method for knowledge management performance evaluation based on triangular fuzzy number and group support systems,"Jun Wang, Dan Ding, Ou Liu, Ming Li, ","Applied Soft Computing, Volume 39, February 2016, Pages 11-20, ","The purpose of this paper is to propose a systematic method to solve knowledge management performance evaluation (KMPE) problems. This method includes an integrated evaluation process starting from the measurement to the output of KMPE and combines subjective and objective indicators together. Firstly, we established an index system, involving the process of knowledge management, the organizational knowledge structure, economic benefits and efficiency. And based on this index system, a synthetic evaluation method is presented, using triangular fuzzy number to measure indexes and facilitating the KMPE with a group support system (GSS). To know better of the proposed method, we have an example to illustrate. Finally, the empirical study conducted in this paper indicates that the evaluation method has strong practicability and operability. Besides, the evaluation is enabled by using a group support system: the more objective scoring can be achieved due to synchronic/asynchronous and anonymous participation; Decision-makers improve their efficiency by the clear demonstration analysis results. The systematic method of KMPE based on the index system is able to improve organizations＊ efficiency in performance evaluation process."

A preliminary study of 12 patients who underwent surgical arthroscopy of the elbow demonstrated that removal of loose bodies produced the best objective and subjective results. Less satisfactory results were obtained when procedures such as capitellum and radial head chondroplasties were performed. Using a preoperative and postoperative point accumulation rating system for four objective and four subjective criteria, the following results were noted. Before surgery 50% of the patients objectively rated their elbows as satisfactory (excellent or good), whereas postoperative ratings increased to 83%. Subjectively, 17% rated their elbows as satisfactory before surgery, improving to 58% satisfactory ratings postoperatively. The only complication was a transient median nerve palsy caused by the extracapsular extravasation of a local anesthetic. From this preliminary study, it was concluded that attention to detail is essential in performing a safe, reproducible arthroscopic examination of the elbow, that arthroscopy of the elbow is an effective diagnostic procedure, and that operative elbow arthroscopy is effective in the treatment of certain elbow disorders."

The current study compares simulation procedures for the fatigue analysis of WEC moorings. The objective is to suggest a simulation procedure suitable for an extensive study of the behaviour of WEC systems and thus for the fatigue analysis of mooring lines. A cylindrical, floating WEC with four spread mooring lines is chosen as case study. The dynamics of the WEC system are simulated and analysed using both coupled and de-coupled models in the time-domain. Four types of simulation procedures are compared using commercial software, DNV DeepC, and an in-house solver, MooDy. A systematic fatigue response analysis based on variations of the numerical and physical parameters is conducted. The results are compared with respect to the fatigue damage calculated using the stress-based approach and the rainflow counting method. The simulation procedure using a coupled model is suggested as the preferred numerical method for capturing the interaction between the components of WEC system, which is proven to be crucial for the fatigue damage evaluation of mooring lines."

Iron reduction and alteration of nontronite NAu-2 by a sulfate-reducing bacterium,"Yi-Liang Li, Hojatollah Vali, S. Kelly Sears, John Yang, Chuanlun L Zhang, ","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, Volume 68, Issue 15, 1 August 2004, Pages 3251-3260, ","Iron-rich clay minerals are abundant in the natural environment and are an important source of iron for microbial metabolism. The objective of this study was to understand the mechanism(s) of enhanced reduction of Fe(III) in iron-rich 2:1 clay minerals under sulfate-reducing conditions. In particular, biogenic reduction of structural Fe(III) in nontronite NAu-2, an Fe-rich smectite-group mineral, was studied using a Desulfovibrio spp. strain G-11 with or without amended sulfate. The microbial production of Fe(II) from NAu-2 is about 10% of total structural Fe(III) (30 mM) when Fe(III) is available as the sole electron acceptor. The measured production of Fe(II), however, can reach 29% of the total structural Fe(III) during sulfate reduction by G-11 when sulfate (50 mM) is concurrently added with NAu-2. In contrast, abiotic production of Fe(II) from the reaction of NAu-2 with Na2S (50 mM) is only ca. 7.5% of the total structural Fe(III). The enhanced reduction of structural Fe(III) by G-11, particularly in the presence of sulfate, is closely related to the growth rate and metabolic activities of the bacteria. Analyses by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy reveal significant changes in the structure and composition of NAu-2 during its alteration by bacterial sulfate reduction. G-11 can also derive nutrients from NAu-2 to support its growth in the absence of amended minerals and vitamins. Results of this study suggest that sulfate-reducing bacteria may play a more significant role than previously recognized in the cycling of Fe, S, and other elements during alteration of Fe-rich 2:1 clay minerals and other silicate minerals."

Designing and Undertaking a Health Economics Study of Digital Health Interventions,"Paul McNamee, Elizabeth Murray, Michael P. Kelly, Laura Bojke, Lucy Yardley, ","American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 51, Issue 5, November 2016, Pages 852-860, ","This paper introduces and discusses key issues in the economic evaluation of digital health interventions. The purpose is to stimulate debate so that existing economic techniques may be refined or new methods developed. The paper does not seek to provide definitive guidance on appropriate methods of economic analysis for digital health interventions.This paper describes existing guides and analytic frameworks that have been suggested for the economic evaluation of healthcare interventions. Using selected examples of digital health interventions, it assesses how well existing guides and frameworks align to digital health interventions. It shows that digital health interventions may be best characterized as complex interventions in complex systems. Key features of complexity relate to intervention complexity, outcome complexity, and causal pathway complexity, with much of this driven by iterative intervention development over time and uncertainty regarding likely reach of the interventions among the relevant population. These characteristics imply that more-complex methods of economic evaluation are likely to be better able to capture fully the impact of the intervention on costs and benefits over the appropriate time horizon. This complexity includes wider measurement of costs and benefits, and a modeling framework that is able to capture dynamic interactions among the intervention, the population of interest, and the environment. The authors recommend that future research should develop and apply more-flexible modeling techniques to allow better prediction of the interdependency between interventions and important environmental influences."

Kunkel, ","Experimental Cell Research, Volume 317, Issue 5, 10 March 2011, Pages 613-619, ","Chemokines are key mediators of leukocyte recruitment during pathogenic insult and also play a prominent role in homeostasis. While most chemokine receptors bind to multiple chemokines, CCR6 is unique in that this receptor is one of only a few that can bind only a single chemokine ligand, CCL20. CCR6 is an important receptor that is involved in regulating several aspects of mucosal immunity, including the ability to mediate the recruitment of immature dendritic cells (DCs) and mature DCs, and professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) to the sites of epithelial inflammation. Further, CCR6 mediates the homing of both CD4+ T (T-helper; Th) cells and DCs to the gut mucosal lymphoid tissue. DCs, which are known to be essential immune cells in innate immunity and in the initiation of adaptive immunity, play a central role in initiating a primary immune response. Herein, we summarize the role of CCR6 in immune responses at epithelial and mucosal sites in both the lung and gut based on a review of the current literature."

But little is known about RWU in developing economies, especially in the Chinese context. In order to obtain the determinants of water use and consumption, empirical study is widely pursued. In a transition economy, rapidly changing socioeconomic conditions profoundly alter household water use in Beijing and Tianjin. A social survey on urban household water use and consumption is judged as a necessary starting point to an efficient municipal water planning and management in the two cities. A total of 806 in-house interviews were completed in Beijing and Tianjin by using stratified sampling method based on the predominant housing typologies. A multivariate analysis has also been performed in order to reveal the structured relationship between the water use and consumption and postulated explanatory variables in various urban households. For the first time, this empirical study will bridge the information gaps regarding urban household water use patterns and compositions, household water amenities and facilities, household water using habits and behaviors, household water perceptions and environmental attitudes as well as a household's capacity and willingness to respond to water conservation policy in different housing typologies in the Chinese context."
Lymph Node Dissection is Not Associated with Improved Survival among Patients Undergoing Cytoreductive Nephrectomy for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Propensity Score Based Analysis,"Boris Gershman, R. Houston Thompson, Daniel M. Moreira, Stephen A. Boorjian, Bradley C. Leibovich, ","The Journal of Urology, Volume 197, Issue 3, Part 1, March 2017, Pages 574-579, ","The oncologic benefit of lymph node dissection for patients undergoing cytoreductive nephrectomy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma is uncertain. Therefore, we evaluated the association of lymph node dissection with oncologic outcomes among patients undergoing cytoreductive nephrectomy.We identified 305 patients treated with cytoreductive nephrectomy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma between 1990 and 2010, of whom 188 (62%) underwent lymph node dissection. Several propensity score techniques were used to evaluate cancer specific and all cause mortality. Internally predicted probabilities for pN1 disease were estimated using logistic regression.Overall 74 (24%) patients had pN1 disease and median followup was 8.5 years (IQR 5.6每10.7). After propensity score adjustment there were no significant differences in clinicopathological features according to whether lymph node dissection was performed. In the overall cohort lymph node dissection was not significantly associated with cancer specific or all cause mortality using any of the propensity score techniques. Moreover, lymph node dissection was not associated with survival outcomes in patients at increased risk for pN1 disease, including patients with preoperative radiographic lymphadenopathy (cN1) or across increasing probability thresholds for pN1 disease from 0.20 to 0.80. Nodal metastases were associated with more aggressive primary tumor features and significantly shorter cancer specific survival.Among patients undergoing cytoreductive nephrectomy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, lymph node dissection was not associated with improved oncologic outcomes in the overall cohort, for patients with preoperative radiographic lymphadenopathy or across increasing probability thresholds for pN1 disease. These findings suggest that lymph node dissection at cytoreductive nephrectomy does not confer an oncologic benefit by cytoreduction of nodal metastases. The presence of nodal metastases is associated with more aggressive tumor biology."
Fetal Glucocorticoid Exposure Is Associated with Preadolescent Brain Development,"Elysia Poggi Davis, Curt A. Sandman, Claudia Buss, Deborah A. Wing, Kevin Head, ","Biological Psychiatry, Volume 74, Issue 9, 1 November 2013, Pages 647-655, ","Glucocorticoids play a critical role in normative regulation of fetal brain development. Exposure to excessive levels may have detrimental consequences and disrupt maturational processes. This may especially be true when synthetic glucocorticoids are administered during the fetal period, as they are to women in preterm labor. This study investigated the consequences for brain development and affective problems of fetal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids.Brain development and affective problems were evaluated in 54 children (56% female), aged 6 to 10, who were full term at birth. Children were recruited into two groups: those with and without fetal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids. Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired and cortical thickness was determined. Child affective problems were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist.Children in the fetal glucocorticoid exposure group showed significant and bilateral cortical thinning. The largest group differences were in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). More than 30% of the rACC was thinner among children with fetal glucocorticoid exposure. Furthermore, children with more affective problems had a thinner left rACC.Fetal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids has neurologic consequences that persist for at least 6 to 10 years. Children with fetal glucocorticoid exposure had a thinner cortex primarily in the rACC. Our data indicating that the rACC is associated with affective problems in conjunction with evidence that this region is involved in affective disorders raise the possibility that glucocorticoid-associated neurologic changes increase vulnerability to mental health problems."

The most widely used methods for BRCA1/2 molecular analysis are Sanger sequencing, and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) followed by the Sanger method. However, recent findings suggest that next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based approaches may be an efficient tool for diagnostic purposes. In this context, we evaluated the effectiveness of NGS for BRCA gene analysis compared with dHPLC/Sanger sequencing.Seventy women were screened for BRCA1/2 mutations by both dHPLC/Sanger sequencing and NGS, and the data were analyzed using a bioinformatic pipeline.Sequence data analysis showed that NGS is more sensitive in detecting BRCA1/2 variants than the conventional procedure, namely, dHPLC/Sanger.Next-generation sequencing is more sensitive, faster, easier to use and less expensive than the conventional Sanger method. Consequently, it is a reliable procedure for the routine molecular screening of the BRCA1/2 genes."

Proteins differentially expressed by these endothelial cell populations are potential drug targets. We used deep proteomic profiling to define the molecular phenotype of human retinal and choroidal endothelial cells at the protein level.Retinal and choroidal vascular endothelial cells were separately isolated from 5 human eye pairs by selection on CD31. Total protein was extracted and digested, and peptide fractions were analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Peptide sequences were assigned to fragment ion spectra, and proteins were inferred from openly accessible protein databases. Protein abundance was determined by spectral counting. Publicly available software packages were used to identify proteins that were differentially expressed between human retinal and choroidal endothelial cells, and to classify proteins that were highly abundant in each endothelial cell population.Human retinal and/or choroidal vascular endothelial cells expressed 5042 nonredundant proteins. Setting the differential expression false discovery rate at 0.05, 498 proteins of 3454 quantifiable proteins (14.4%) with minimum mean spectral counts of 2.5 were differentially abundant in the 2 cell populations. Retinal and choroidal endothelial cells were enriched in angiogenic proteins, and retinal endothelial cells were also enriched in immunologic proteins.This work describes the different protein expression profiles of human retinal and choroidal vascular endothelial cells, and provides multiple candidates for further study as novel treatments or drug targets for posterior eye diseases.

Fluorescence excitation每emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs) for DOM characterization in flocculation process at present is not well known. It is for this reason that the EEMs in this study was employed to characterize the Missouri River DOM removal by the flocculation process. The results showed that four underlying components extracted from the EEMs of DOM by parallel factor (PARAFAC) were humic acid-like (A), fulvic acid-like (B), protein-like (C) and unidentified component (D), while the Missouri River DOM was dominated by A, B and C. Flocculation was effective for the hydrophobic organic compound A followed by the hydrophilic organic compounds B and C, whereas the smallest molecular size compound C was hard to treat. Further study illustrated that for flocculation at pH 7, higher DOC and THM removal efficiencies were obtained, and that the correlations of DOM components with DOC and THM removal efficiencies were significant, thus indicating that the EEMs-PARAFAC offers a robust analytical method for assessing DOM removal efficiency in the flocculation process."

Peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Orbitrap Fusion) and mapped to the mouse proteome for relative protein quantification.1871 proteins in lens epithelia and 870 proteins in lens fiber cells were quantified. 40 proteins in LEGSKO epithelia, 14 proteins in LEGSKO fiber cells, 22 proteins in buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)-treated LEGSKO epithelia, and 55 proteins in BSO-treated LEGSKO fiber cells had significantly (p<0.05, FDR<0.1) altered protein expression compared to WT controls. HSF4 and MAF transcription factors were the most common upstream regulators of the response to GSH-deficiency. Many detoxification proteins, including aldehyde dehydrogenases, peroxiredoxins, and quinone oxidoreductase, were upregulated but several glutathione S-transferases were downregulated. Several cellular stress response proteins showed regulation changes, including an upregulation of HERPUD1, downregulation of heme oxygenase, and mixed changes in heat shock proteins. NRF2-regulated proteins showed broad upregulation in BSO-treated LEGSKO fiber cells, but not in other groups. Strong trends were seen in downregulation of lens specific proteins, including 汕- and 污-crystallins, lengsin, and phakinin, and in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related changes. Western blot analysis of LEGSKO lens epithelia confirmed expression changes in several proteins.This dataset confirms at the proteomic level many findings from the recently determined GSH-deficient lens transcriptome and provides new insight into the roles of GSH in the lens, how the lens adapts to oxidative stress, and how GSH affects EMT in the lens.Download high-res image (211KB)Download full-size image"

Factors that affect the nearshore aggregations of Antarctic krill in a biological hotspot,"Kim S. Bernard, Megan Cimino, William Fraser, Josh Kohut, Peter Winsor, ","Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers, Volume 126, August 2017, Pages 139-147, ","Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a highly abundant and ecologically important zooplankton species in the Southern Ocean. Regions of elevated Antarctic krill biomass exist around Antarctica, often as a result of the concentrating effect of bathymetry and ocean currents. Such areas are considered biological hotspots and are key foraging grounds for numerous top predators in the region. A hotspot of Antarctic krill biomass exists off the southern extent of Anvers Island, Western Antarctic Peninsula, and supports a population of Ad谷lie penguins that feed almost exclusively on it, as well as numerous other top predators. We investigated the spatio-temporal variability in Antarctic krill biomass and aggregation structure over four consecutive summer seasons, identifying environmental factors that were responsible. We identified three distinct krill aggregation types (Large-dense, Small-close and Small-sparse), and found that the relative proportion of each type to total aggregation numbers varied significantly between survey days. Large-dense aggregations occurred more frequently when westerly winds predominated and when the local mixed tide was in the diurnal regime. Small-close aggregations were also more frequent during diurnal tides and were negatively correlated with phytoplankton biomass. Small-sparse aggregations, on the other hand, were more prevalent when the mixed tide was in the semi-diurnal phase. We suggest that, under certain conditions (i.e. diurnal tides and westerly winds), the biological hotspot in the nearshore waters off Palmer Station, Anvers Island, functions as a zone of accumulation, concentrating krill biomass. Our findings provide important information on the dynamics of Antarctic krill at the local scale."
Estimating the complete CO2 emissions and the carbon intensity in India: From the carbon transfer perspective,"Chuanwang Sun, Dan Ding, Mian Yang, ","Energy Policy, Volume 109, October 2017, Pages 418-427, ","With the impacts of climate change causing widespread concerns, many scholars had discussed carbon leakage in the international trade, which ignored carbon transfer within domestic sectors. Departing from them, this paper took into account energy-related CO2 emissions embodied in intermediate production processes. We used the SRIO model to calculate and analyze the carbon footprint of economic sectors in India during the period of 1995每2009, and also investigated the changes in the carbon emission intensity of each sector. The results showed that, from the production perspective, the most famous ""high carbon"" sector was EGW (electricity, gas and water supply), and this sector accounted for 60% of the CO2 emissions of the secondary industry. From the consumption perspective, this ratio was only maintained at between 10%每16%. In contrast, traditional ""low carbon"" sector, CON (construction) emitted the largest CO2 to other sectors. In addition, more than 90% of the sectors showed a decreasing trend of carbon emission intensity. The conclusions of this paper have important policy implications for the correct allocation of CO2 emission responsibility, establishment of fair and effective emission reduction policies and the transformation of low carbon economy in India."

Probability evolution method for exit location distribution,"Jinjie Zhu, Zhen Chen, Xianbin Liu, ","Physics Letters A, Volume 382, Issue 11, 23 March 2018, Pages 771-775, ","The exit problem in the framework of the large deviation theory has been a hot topic in the past few decades. The most probable escape path in the weak-noise limit has been clarified by the Freidlin每Wentzell action functional. However, noise in real physical systems cannot be arbitrarily small while noise with finite strength may induce nontrivial phenomena, such as noise-induced shift and noise-induced saddle-point avoidance. Traditional Monte Carlo simulation of noise-induced escape will take exponentially large time as noise approaches zero. The majority of the time is wasted on the uninteresting wandering around the attractors. In this paper, a new method is proposed to decrease the escape simulation time by an exponentially large factor by introducing a series of interfaces and by applying the reinjection on them. This method can be used to calculate the exit location distribution. It is verified by examining two classical examples and is compared with theoretical predictions. The results show that the method performs well for weak noise while may induce certain deviations for large noise. Finally, some possible ways to improve our method are discussed."

Cox models were used to evaluate the association of the number of lymph nodes removed with oncologic outcomes.A total of 111 (6.2%) patients were pN1. The median follow-up after surgery was 10.6 yr. Following PS adjustment, there were no significant differences in clinicopathologic features between patients with and without LND. In the overall cohort, LND was not significantly associated with a reduced risk of distant metastases, CSM, or ACM. Moreover, LND was not associated with improved oncologic outcomes even among patients at increased risk of pN1 disease, including those with preoperative radiographic lymphadenopathy, or across increasing threshold probabilities for pN1 disease from 0.05 to 0.50. Among patients who underwent LND, the extent of LND was not significantly associated with the development of distant metastases, CSM, or ACM. Limitations include the retrospective design.We did not identify an oncologic benefit to LND in the overall cohort or among patients at increased risk of nodal disease. These findings do not support a therapeutic benefit to LND in patients with M0 RCC.Lymph node dissection does not appear to provide a therapeutic benefit in patients with nonmetastatic renal cell carcinoma."
Shape of the basal ganglia in preadolescent children is associated with cognitive performance,"Curt A. Sandman, Kevin Head, L. Tugan Muftuler, Lydia Su, Elysia Poggi. Davis, ","NeuroImage, Volume 99, 1 October 2014, Pages 93-102, ","Current studies support the belief that high levels of performance and intellectual abilities are associated with increased brain size or volume. With few exceptions, this conclusion is restricted to studies of post-adolescent subjects and to cerebral cortex. There is evidence that ※bigger is better§ may not pertain to children and further, that there are areas of the brain in which larger structures are associated with cognitive deficits. In 50 preadolescent children (21 girls) a structural survey of the brain (VBM) was conducted to determine and locate areas in which gray matter volume was associated with poor cognitive performance. Only increased gray matter volume in particular areas of the basal ganglia and specifically the putamen was significantly associated with poor performance on tests of memory, response speed and a general marker and subtests of intelligence. Based on the VBM findings, volumetric analysis of basal ganglia structures was performed using FSL/FIRST. However, no significant changes in total volume of putamen or other basal ganglia structures were detected with this analysis. The disagreement between measures of localized gray matter differences and volumetric analysis suggested that there might be local regional deformity rather than widespread volumetric changes of the putamen. Surface analysis with FSL/FIRST demonstrated that bilateral outward deformation of the putamen, but especially the left, was associated with poor performance on several cognitive tests. Expansion of the globus pallidus and caudate nucleus also was associated with poor performance. Moreover a significant association was detected between a reliable test of language-free intelligence and topographically distinct outward and inward deformation of the putamen. Expansion and contraction of the putamen as a predictor of intelligence may explain why this association was not observed with measures of total volume. These results suggest that deformity is a sensitive measure of function, and that distortion of the basal ganglia may be a neurophenotype for risk of developmental impairment."

DNA libraries were prepared using a picodroplet PCR-based approach and sequenced with the MiSeq System. Highly putative pathogenic mutations were identified in genes other than the commonly tested BRCA1/2: 2 pathogenic mutations one in TP53 and one in MUTYH; 2 missense variants in MSH6 and ATM, respectively; 2 frameshift variants in KLLN, and ATAD2, respectively; an intronic variant in ANPEP, and 3 not functionally known variants (a frameshift variant in ATM a nonsense variant in ATM and a missense variant in NFE2L2). Our results show that this molecular screening will increase diagnostic sensitivity leading to a better risk assessment in breast cancer patients and their families. This strategy could also reveal genes that have a higher penetrance for breast and ovarian cancers by matching gene mutation with familial and clinical data, thereby increasing information about hereditary breast and ovarian cancer genetics and improving cancer prevention measures or therapeutic approaches.Download high-res image (242KB)Download full-size image"

The results showed that U(VI) reduction was strongly inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline and TEA in a pH range from 6.9 to 9.0. For instance, at pH 6.9 the observed U(VI) reduction rates decreased by 81% and 82% in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline and TEA, respectively. The inhibition was attributed to the formation of stable complexes between 1,10-phenanthroline and Fe(II) or TEA and Fe(III). In the absence of iron chelators, U(VI) reduction can be enhanced by surface-bound Fe(II) on nanoFe0. Our results suggested that Fe(III) and Fe(II) possibly acted as an electron shuttle to ferry the electrons from nanoFe0 to U(VI), therefore a combined system with Fe(II), Fe(III) and nanoFe0 could facilitate U(VI) reductive immobilization in the contaminated groundwater."

The grain accumulation of other elements of concern, selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo), and cadmium (Cd) was also monitored. Results demonstrated that high soil-As not only resulted in high grain-As, but could also result in high grain-Se, and Zhe 733 had significantly less grain-As than Cocodrie did. However, soil-As did not impact grain-Mo and Cd. Among all elements monitored, iron oxide amendment significantly reduced grain-As for both cultivars, while the phosphate application only reduced grain-Se for Zhe 733. Results also indicated that cultivar type significantly impacted grain accumulation of all monitored trace elements. Therefore, applying iron oxide to As-contaminated land, in addition to choosing appropriate rice cultivar, can effectively reduce the grain accumulation of As.Download high-res image (129KB)Download full-size image"

Scherer, Baolin Deng, Shaodong Hu, ","Water Research, Volume 35, Issue 18, December 2001, Pages 4435-4443, ","Recent studies of contaminant reduction by zero-valent iron metal (Fe0) have highlighted the role of iron oxides at the metal每water interface and the effect that sorption has at the oxide每water interface on contaminant reduction kinetics. The results suggest that a variety of organic surface-active substances might enhance or inhibit contaminant degradation, depending on the degree to which they promote solubilization, sorption, and/or reaction. Of particular interest is the effect of natural organic matter (NOM), because of its ubiquitous presence in natural waters and amphiphilic properties; anthropogenic surfactants, because of their use in groundwater remediation; and certain quinones, which represent the redox-active functional groups associated with NOM. In this study, no well-defined effects of these substances were found on the reduction of nitro benzene by Fe0, but the reduction of carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene (TCE) was inhibited by NOM. Results with carbon tetrachloride showed that the inhibitory effect of humic acids was greater than fulvic acids, but that several quinonoid NOM model compounds (juglone, lawsone, and anthraquinone disulfonate) increased the rate of reduction by Fe0.

The role of adjuvant immunomodulatory agents for treatment of severe influenza,"David S. Hui, Nelson Lee, Paul K. Chan, John H. Beigel, ","Antiviral Research, Volume 150, February 2018, Pages 202-216, ","A severe inflammatory immune response with hypercytokinemia occurs in patients hospitalized with severe influenza, such as avian influenza A(H5N1), A(H7N9), and seasonal A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections. The role of immunomodulatory therapy is unclear as there have been limited published data based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Passive immunotherapy such as convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin have some studies demonstrating benefit when administered as an adjunctive therapy for severe influenza. Triple combination of oseltamivir, clarithromycin, and naproxen for severe influenza has one study supporting its use, and confirmatory studies would be of great interest. Likewise, confirmatory studies of sirolimus without concomitant corticosteroid therapy should be explored as a research priority. Other agents with potential immunomodulating effects, including non-immune intravenous immunoglobulin, N-acetylcysteine, acute use of statins, macrolides, pamidronate, nitazoxanide, chloroquine, antiC5a antibody, interferons, human mesenchymal stromal cells, mycophenolic acid, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors agonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, mesalazine, herbal medicine, and the role of plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion as rescue therapy have supportive preclinical or observational clinical data, and deserve more investigation preferably by RCTs. Systemic corticosteroids administered in high dose may increase the risk of mortality and morbidity in patients with severe influenza and should not be used, while the clinical utility of low dose systemic corticosteroids requires further investigation."

Large eddy simulation of unsteady shedding behavior in cavitating flows with time-average validation,"Linmin Li, Baokuan Li, Zhiqiang Hu, Yang Lin, Sherman C. P. Cheung, ","Ocean Engineering, Volume 125, 1 October 2016, Pages 1-11, ","Cavitation always leads to complex gas每liquid interactions and turbulence structures with multi-scale eddies and vortices. It usually involves cavity growth, break-off and collapse processes; posing great challenges in modeling. This paper focuses on modeling instantaneous cavitating flows using the large eddy simulation (LES) and validating the predictions against experimental data using the time-average method. The volume of fluid (VOF) model was adopted to describe phase equations and coupled with the Schnerr每Sauer cavitation model for describing the evaporation-condensation mass transfer. Simulations were performed to predict the unsteady cavitating flows of both the cylinder and Clark-Y hydrofoil configurations. Firstly, the mechanisms of cavity shedding, vapor cloud forming and collapsing were well revealed. The time-averaged pressure distribution and cavity length around the cylinder were in good agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the periodic cavity shedding and pressure fluctuation around the Clark-Y hydrofoil were also predicted. Different cavity patterns were clearly identified in a typical cycle, and the effect of cavity pattern on hydrodynamic forces was investigated. The computational results of cavity patterns, velocity profiles, drag and lift coefficients were compared with experimental results and good agreements were obtained. The present work provides a valid numerical modeling framework for various cavitating flows."
"Temperament factors and dimensional, latent bifactor models of child psychopathology: Transdiagnostic and specific associations in two youth samples","Benjamin L. Hankin, Elysia Poggi Davis, Hannah Snyder, Jami F. Young, Curt A. Sandman, ","Psychiatry Research, Volume 252, June 2017, Pages 139-146, ","Common emotional and behavioral symptoms co-occur and are associated with core temperament factors. This study investigated links between temperament and dimensional, latent psychopathology factors, including a general common psychopathology factor (p factor) and specific latent internalizing and externalizing liabilities, as captured by a bifactor model, in two independent samples of youth. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that temperament factors of negative affectivity (NA), positive affectivity (PA), and effortful control (EC) could serve as both transdiagnostic and specific risks in relation to recent bifactor models of child psychopathology. Sample 1 included 571 youth (average age 13.6, SD =2.37, range 9.3每17.5) with both youth and parent report. Sample 2 included 554 preadolescent children (average age 7.7, SD =1.35, range =5每11 years) with parent report. Structural equation modeling showed that the latent bifactor models fit in both samples. Replicated in both samples, the p factor was associated with lower EC and higher NA (transdiagnostic risks). Several specific risks replicated in both samples after controlling for co-occurring symptoms via the p factor: internalizing was associated with higher NA and lower PA, lower EC related to externalizing problems."
On the impact of seed scheduling in peer-to-peer networks,"Flavio Esposito, Ibrahim Matta, Debajyoti Bera, Pietro Michiardi, ","Computer Networks, Volume 55, Issue 15, 27 October 2011, Pages 3303-3317, ","In a content distribution (file sharing) scenario, the initial phase is delicate due to the lack of global knowledge and the dynamics of the overlay. An unwise piece dissemination in this phase can cause delays in reaching steady state, thus increasing file download times. After showing that finding the scheduling strategy for optimal dissemination is computationally hard, even when the offline knowledge of the overlay is given, we devise a new class of scheduling algorithms at the seed (source peer with full content), based on a proportional fair approach, and we implement them on a real file sharing client. In addition to simulation results, we validated on our own file sharing client (BUTorrent) that our solution improves up to 25% the average downloading time of a standard file sharing protocol. Moreover, we give theoretical upper bounds on the improvements that our scheduling strategies may achieve."
Geometrically exact displacement-based shell theory,"P. Frank Pai, Robert D. Chapman, Zaichun Feng, ","Thin-Walled Structures, Volume 70, September 2013, Pages 1-18, ","The deformed geometry often is the most important information for applications of highly flexible plates/shells, and a geometrically exact shell theory should be displacement-based in order to directly and exactly describe any greatly deformed geometry. The main challenges of modeling a shell undergoing large deformation are how to describe its deformed reference plane and its differential element's large rotations and how to derive objective strains in terms of global displacements and rotations that contain both elastic straining and rigid-body movement. This paper presents a truly geometrically exact displacement-based shell theory without singularity problems. The theory fully accounts for geometric nonlinearities, all possible initial curvatures, and extensionality by using Jaumann strains and stresses, exact coordinate transformation, and orthogonal virtual rotations. Moreover, transverse shear deformations are accounted for by using a high-order shear deformation theory. The derived fully nonlinear strain每displacement relations enable geometrically exact forward analysis (obtaining the deformed geometry under a set of known loads) and inverse analysis (obtaining the required loads for a desired deformed geometry). Several numerical examples are used to demonstrate the accuracy and capabilities of the geometrically exact shell theory. Moreover, different theoretical and numerical problems of other geometrically nonlinear shell theories are shown to be mainly caused by the use of Mindlin plate theory to account for transverse shears, Green每Lagrange strains to account for geometric nonlinearities, and/or Euler and Rodrigues parameters to model large rotations."
On supporting mobility and multihoming in recursive internet architectures,"Vatche Ishakian, Joseph Akinwumi, Flavio Esposito, Ibrahim Matta, ","Computer Communications, Volume 35, Issue 13, 15 July 2012, Pages 1561-1573, ","As the Internet has evolved and grown, an increasing number of nodes (hosts or autonomous systems) have become multihomed, i.e., a node is connected to more than one network. Mobility can be viewed as a special case of multihoming〞as a node moves, it unsubscribes from one network and subscribes to another, which is akin to one interface becoming inactive and another active. The current Internet architecture has been facing significant challenges in effectively dealing with multihoming (and consequently mobility), which has led to the emergence of several custom point-solutions. The Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (RINA) was recently proposed as a clean-slate solution to the current problems of the Internet. In this paper, we present a specification of the process of ROuting in Recursive Architectures (RORA). We also perform an average-case cost analysis to compare the multihoming/mobility support of RINA, against that of other approaches such as LISP and Mobile-IP. Extensive experimental results confirm the premise that the RINA architecture and its RORA routing approach are inherently better suited for supporting mobility and multihoming."

In this study, low temperature plasmas were used to treat a commercial PVDF membrane in order to improve its hydrophilicity and make it suitable for fabrication of a polyamide每polyvinylidene fluoride thin-film composite (PA-PVDF) membrane. The plasma treatment used oxygen, methane, or their 1:1 mixture gas to produce glow discharge for treatment and surface modification of the PVDF membrane. The membrane surfaces were characterized using water contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE SEM). Pure water permeability and salt rejection tests were performed to evaluate the performance of the resulting PA-PVDF. Our experimental results indicated that plasma treatment of PVDF membrane could significantly reduce its water contact angle and thus produce a hydrophilic surface that could be then used as the support substrate layer for the fabrication of TFC membrane through interfacial polymerization. Our experimental results also demonstrated that PA-PVDF membrane supports not only demonstrated higher pure water permeability, but also higher salt rejections than those of TFC membrane with polysulfone as the support."

A primitive-based 3D segmentation algorithm for mechanical CAD models,"Truc Le, Ye Duan, ","Computer Aided Geometric Design, Volumes 52每53, March每April 2017, Pages 231-246, ","This paper presents a novel segmentation algorithm for mechanical CAD models (represented by either mesh or point cloud) constructed from planes, cylinders, cones, spheres, tori and easily extendable to surfaces of revolution. Our proposed approach differs from existing techniques in the following aspects. First, by assuming that common mechanical models only have a limited number of dominant orientations that their primitives are either parallel or orthogonal to, we narrow down the search space for detecting the primitives to the automatically estimated major orientations of the input model. Second, we employ a dimension reduction method which transforms the problem of detecting 3D primitives into the classical 2D problems such as circle and line detection in images. Third, we generate an over-complete set of primitives and formulate the segmentation as a set cover optimization problem. We demonstrate our method's robustness to noise and show that it compares favorably with state-of-the-art solutions such as the RANSAC-based (Schnabel et al., 2007) and GlobFit (Li et al., 2011) approaches on many synthetic and real scanned examples."

Extended LND, defined as removal of ≡13 lymph nodes, was examined in a sensitivity analysis.A total of 184 (9%) patients were pN1 and 302 (15%) were M1. Thirty-day complications occurred in 194 (9%) patients, including Clavien grade ≡3 complications in 81 (4%) patients. Clinicopathologic features were well balanced after propensity score adjustment. In the overall cohort, LND was not statistically significantly associated with Clavien grade ≡3 complications, although there was an approximately 40% increased risk of any Clavien grade complication that did not reach statistical significance. Likewise, LND was not significantly associated with any Clavien grade or Clavien grade ≡3 complications when separately evaluated among M0 or M1 patients. Extended LND was not significantly associated with any Clavien grade or Clavien grade ≡3 complications. LND was not associated with length of stay or estimated blood loss. Limitations include a retrospective design.LND is not significantly associated with an increased risk of Clavien grade ≡3 complications, although it may be associated with a modestly increased risk of minor complications. In the absence of increased morbidity, LND may be justified in a predominantly staging role in the management of RCC.Lymph node dissection for renal cell carcinoma is not associated with increased rates of major complications."
Chapter 13: Neurobehavioral Disorders and Developmental Origins of Health and Disease,"Curt A. Sandman, Quetzal A. Class, Laura M. Glynn, Elysia Poggi Davis, ","The Epigenome and Developmental Origins of Health and Disease, 2016, Pages 235-266, ","The human fetus is an active participant in its own development by integrating information received from its maternal host into its neurodevelopmental program to prepare for life after birth. Because the fetal nervous system develops at precise times and in a specific sequence from conception to birth, disruption by intrauterine events in the timing or sequence of brain development results in tissue remodeling. Depending on the timing of the disruption, the function and physiological capacity of the remodeled brain is affected throughout the lifespan. Evidence from prospective and retrospective studies supports the conclusion that fetal exposures to maternal signals of psychobiological stress or being born small or early are associated with increased risk for behavioral disorders and alterations in brain structures in children and adults. A range of early-life exposures results in similar neurobehavioral ※programs§ suggesting a common neural mechanism. Alteration in dendritic tree complexity is one plausible mechanism that mediates the relation between fetal exposure to stress and neurobehavioral programming."
Fetal exposure to placental corticotropin-releasing hormone is associated with child self-reported internalizing symptoms,"Mariann A. Howland, Curt A. Sandman, Laura M. Glynn, Cheryl Crippen, Elysia Poggi Davis, ","Psychoneuroendocrinology, Volume 67, May 2016, Pages 10-17, ","Fetal exposure to maternal prenatal stress hormones such as cortisol exerts influences on the developing nervous system that persist and include risk for internalizing symptoms later in life. Placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (pCRH) is a feto-placental stress signal that also shapes fetal neurodevelopment and may be a more direct indicator of the fetal experience than maternal stress hormones. The programming effects of pCRH on child development are unknown. The current investigation examined associations between prenatal maternal and placental stress hormone exposures (maternal cortisol and pCRH) and child self-reported internalizing symptoms at age 5.Maternal plasma cortisol and pCRH levels were measured at 15, 19, 25, 31, and 36 weeks＊ gestation in a sample of 83 women and their 91 children (8 sibling pairs from separate pregnancies), who were born full-term. Child self-reported internalizing symptoms at age 5 were obtained using scales of the Berkeley Puppet Interview.Placental CRH profiles (including elevations in mid-gestation) were associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms at age 5. This effect was not explained by critical prenatal or postnatal influences, including obstetric risk, concurrent maternal psychological state, and family socio-economic status. Prenatal maternal cortisol was not significantly associated with child self-reported internalizing symptoms.Findings suggest that elevated exposures to the feto-placental stress signal pCRH exert programming effects on the developing fetal central nervous system, with lasting consequences for child mental health."
Singularities of fluctuational paths for an overdamped two-well system driven by white noise,"Zhen Chen, Xianbin Liu, ","Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, Volume 469, 1 March 2017, Pages 206-215, ","Noise-induced escape from a metastable state in an overdamped double-well system is investigated. With the WKB approximation employed, the pattern of fluctuational paths is given. By using the action plot, which gives rise to MPEPs, the pattern is divided into various regions where fluctuational paths inside show qualitatively distinguished characteristics. The global quasi-potential is calculated and its value at the saddle on the boundary agrees with the one obtained by action plot. We show a contour and 3D plot of the quasi-potential to illustrate the relative stabilities of metastable states. The bifurcations of singularities as the system parameter varies are analyzed by the second-order term of the WKB expansion in the vicinity of x axis. Its asymptotic behavior determines the positions of cusps and furthermore, its evolution turns out to delineate the twisting structure of the Lagrangian manifold."
Robust control design for a wheel loader using H﹢ and feedback linearization based methods,"Roger Fales, Atul Kelkar, ","ISA Transactions, Volume 48, Issue 3, July 2009, Pages 312-320, ","The heavy equipment industry is building more and more equipment with electro-hydraulic control systems. The existing industry practices for the design of control systems in construction machines primarily rely on classical designs coupled with ad-hoc synthesis procedures. Such practices produce desirable results, but lack a systematic procedure to account for invariably present plant uncertainties in the design process as well as coupled dynamics of the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) configuration. In this paper, two H﹢ based robust control designs are presented for an automatic bucket leveling mechanism of a wheel loader. In one case, the controller is designed for the base plant model. In another case, the controller is designed for the plant with a feedback linearization control law applied yielding improved stability robustness. A MIMO nonlinear model for an electro-hydraulically actuated wheel loader linkage is considered. The robustness of the controller designs are validated by using analysis and by simulation using a complete nonlinear model of the wheel loader linkage and hydraulic system."
Uncertainty modeling and predicting the probability of stability and performance in the manufacture of dynamic systems,"Roger Fales, ","ISA Transactions, Volume 49, Issue 4, October 2010, Pages 528-534, ","In this work, a method for determining the reliability of dynamic systems is discussed. Using statistical information on system parameters, the goal is to determine the probability of a dynamic system achieving or not achieving frequency domain performance specifications such as low frequency tracking error, and bandwidth. An example system is considered with closed loop control. A performance specification is given and converted into a performance weight transfer function. The example system is found to have a 20% chance of not achieving the given performance specification. An example of a realistic higher order system model of an electro hydraulic valve with spring feedback and position measurement feedback is also considered. The spring rate and viscous friction are considered as random variables with normal distributions. It was found that nearly 6% of valve systems would not achieve the given frequency domain performance requirement. Uncertainty modeling is also considered. An uncertainty model for the hydraulic valve systems is presented with the same uncertain parameters as in the previous example. However, the uncertainty model was designed such that only 95% of plants would be covered by the uncertainty model. This uncertainty model was applied to the valve control system example in a robust performance test."

We then study the origins of singularities from a topological point of view by considering structures of the Lagrangian manifold and action surface. The switching line and cusp point turn out to have physical significance since they may impact the prehistory distributions, making the optimal path invalid."
Prenatal maternal mood patterns predict child temperament and adolescent mental health,"Laura M. Glynn, Mariann A. Howland, Curt A. Sandman, Elysia P. Davis, Hal S.

Maternal mood was assessed repeatedly during pregnancy as early as 15 weeks＊ gestation. Predictability of maternal mood was calculated by applying Shannon's entropy to the distribution of responses on mood questionnaires. Maternal reports of child negative affectivity (a predictor of later internalizing) were collected at 6, 12, 24 months and 7 years of age. Child self-reports of anxiety symptoms were collected at 10 years and reports of depression symptoms at 13 years.Fetal exposure to more elevated maternal mood entropy predicted higher levels of child negative affectivity at 12 months (r = .36; p < 01), 24 months (r = .31; p < 01) and 7 years (r = .32; p < 01) of age. In addition, children exposed to higher prenatal maternal mood entropy, reported higher levels of anxiety symptoms at 10 years (r = .24; p < 01) and elevated depressive symptoms at 13 years (r = .29; p < .01). These associations persisted after adjusting for maternal pre and postnatal mood valence (e.g. depression levels) and for other relevant demographic characteristics.Our findings provide strong support for the notion that patterns of maternal mood influence the developing brain. More specifically, they suggest that prenatal maternal mood predictability may be a critical predictor of developmental mental health trajectories and should be considered when assessing early life influences on lifespan mental health."

The impacts of solvent, APTES concentration, reactive time and temperature on the surface modification were evaluated. The aqueous Hg adsorptive kinetics and capacity were also determined. Results demonstrated that the strong Hg-binding amine ligands were effectively introduced onto the AC surfaces through the silanol reaction between carbon surface functional groups (每COOH, 每COH) and APTES molecules. The modification lowered the pH at the point of zero charge (pHpzc) to 4.54 from 9.6, favoring cation adsorption. MAC presented a faster rate of the Hg (II) adsorption and more than double adsorptive capacity as compared with AC."

Goldberg, ","Hormones and Behavior, Volume 85, September 2016, Pages 19-25, ","In many non-human species, including primates, gestational reproductive hormones play an essential role in the onset of maternal motivation and behaviors. We investigated the associations between prepartum estradiol and progesterone and maternal behavior at 1-year postpartum in 177 women. Blood was obtained at five gestational time points and an index of quality of maternal care was determined using a well-validated mother-child interaction protocol. Women who exhibited higher quality maternal care at 1-year postpartum were characterized by unique gestational profiles of estradiol, progesterone and the estrogen to progesterone ratio; specifically by slower accelerations and levels of these hormone trajectories beginning in midgestation. Further, it appeared that both fetal sex and parity moderated these findings, with first time mothers and mothers of females showing stronger associations. In sum, these data document persisting associations between prepartum hormone profiles and human maternal behavior. More broadly, these findings add to the growing literature highlighting the perinatal period as one of critical neurodevelopment in the lifespan of the human female."

Integrating segmentation with deep learning for enhanced classification of epithelial and stromal tissues in H&E images,"Zahraa Al-Milaji, Ilker Ersoy, Adel Hafiane, Kannappan Palaniappan, Filiz Bunyak, ","Pattern Recognition Letters, In press, corrected proof, Available online 7 September 2017, ","Initiation, progression, and therapeutic response in cancer are largely influenced by tumor microenvironment. Segmentation of tumor into epithelial vs. stromal regions constitutes the first step for the study of tumor microenvironment and its effects on disease progression. This paper proposes a new method for stromal vs. epithelial tissue identification from images of H&E stained specimens. The proposed method integrates convolutional neural networks (CNN) based supervised classification with unsupervised image segmentation. The scheme combines the strengths of deep learning (feature learning and classification) with the boundary localization accuracy of image segmentation for enhanced performance. Our experimental results on Stanford Tissue Microarray Database show that integration of CNN classification with explicit image segmentation leads to better adherence of identified class boundaries to actual tissue boundaries and improves the classification accuracy."

The antitumor effects of interferon-alpha are maintained in mice challenged with a STAT1-deficient murine melanoma cell line,"Brian Badgwell, Gregory B Lesinski, Cynthia Magro, Gerard Abood, William Carson, ","Journal of Surgical Research, Volume 116, Issue 1, January 2004, Pages 129-136, ","Interferon-alpha (IFN-汐) is currently administered to patients with metastatic malignant melanoma and those who are at risk for recurrence following surgery for high-risk lesions. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is a transcription factor that is activated by IFN-汐 and is thought to mediate the majority of its antitumor effects. Loss of STAT1 has been found in IFN-resistant melanoma cells. We developed a murine melanoma cell line in a STAT1-deficient mouse. We also transfected B16 melanoma cells with a wild-type form of STAT1 to induce its overexpression. Using the resulting cell lines and STAT1-deficient mice, we tested whether IFN-汐 could exert an antitumor effect on melanoma cells in the absence of STAT1-mediated signal transduction.A melanoma tumor was induced in STAT1-deficient mice via the application of DMBA (tumor initiator) followed by croton oil (tumor promoter). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that the resulting tumor was a malignant melanoma. Immunoblot analysis, intracellular flow cytometry, and gel-shift analysis were used to confirm the lack of STAT1 in the derivative cell line (AGS-1). In addition, the STAT1 protein was overexpressed in B16 melanoma cells by stable transfection with a plasmid construct encoding wild-type STAT1. The effects of IFN-汐 on these cell lines were studied in vitro and in vivo.STAT1 was not expressed in the AGS-1 murine melanoma cell line. Treatment with IFN-汐 did not lead to activation of STAT1. Cell proliferation assays revealed that while IFN-汐 did not exert an antiproliferative effect on this cell line, it was capable of prolonging the survival of STAT1-competent C57BL/6 mice bearing 1 ℅ 106 AGS-1 tumor cells in the intraperitoneal position (n = 20, P < 0.05), as compared to PBS-treated controls. Also, the survival of IFN-汐-treated mice (as compared to PBS-treated controls) was not affected by the overexpression of STAT1 in B16 tumor cells.This data suggests that IFN-汐 can enhance survival in an animal model where STAT1-mediated signal transduction and gene regulation is absent within the tumor but is present within the host. This data also indicates that the overexpression of STAT1 within the tumor does not significantly enhance the effects of exogenously administered IFN-汐 in this model. These findings indicate that the bulk of the antitumor actions of IFN-汐 may be derived from its effects on host tissues."

To account for the introduction of targeted therapies, timing of surgery was classified as immunotherapy era (1990每2004) or contemporary era (2005每2010). Risk scores were developed to predict CSS using Cox proportional hazards regression models.A total of 215 (69%) and 98 (31%) patients were treated in the immunotherapy and contemporary eras, respectively. Median follow-up among survivors was 9.6 years, during which time 291 patients died, including 279 from RCC. On multivariable analysis limited to preoperative features, age ≡ 75, (hazard ratio [HR] 1.9), female sex (HR 1.9), constitutional symptoms (HR 1.61), radiographic lymphadenopathy (HR 1.59), and IVC tumor thrombus (HR 1.65) were significantly associated with CSS. On multivariable analysis including pathologic features, the features above as well as coagulative necrosis (HR 1.51) and sarcomatoid differentiation (HR 1.44) were significantly associated with CSS (all P < 0.05). Risk scores were developed for each model and used to predict CSS according to era. Decision curve analysis revealed that the preoperative risk score conferred a net benefit over a treat-all or treat-none approach beyond a 1-year cancer-specific mortality threshold of 25%.We developed risk scores to predict CSS for patients treated with CN in the contemporary era. Patients with poor predicted survival may consider avoiding CN as initial management."

Is there a viability每vulnerability tradeoff? Sex differences in fetal programming,"Curt A Sandman, Laura M Glynn, Elysia Poggi Davis, ","Journal of Psychosomatic Research, Volume 75, Issue 4, October 2013, Pages 327-335, ","In this paper we evaluate the evidence for sex differences in fetal programming within the context of the proposed viability每vulnerability tradeoff.We briefly review the literature on the factors contributing to primary and secondary sex ratios. Sex differences in fetal programming are assessed by summarizing previously published sex difference findings from our group (6 studies) and also new analyses of previously published findings in which sex differences were not reported (6 studies).The review and reanalysis of studies from our group are consistent with the overwhelming evidence of increasing risk for viability among males exposed to environmental adversity early in life. New evidence reported here support the argument that females, despite their adaptive agility, also are influenced by exposure to early adversity. Two primary conclusions are (i) female fetal exposure to psychobiological stress selectively influences fear/anxiety, and (ii) the effects of female fetal exposure to stress persist into preadolescence. These persisting effects are reflected in increased levels of anxiety, impaired executive function and neurological markers associated with these behaviors.A tacit assumption is that females, with their adaptive flexibility early in gestation, escape the consequences of early life exposure to adversity. We argue that the consequences of male exposure to early adversity threaten their viability, effectively culling the weak and the frail and creating a surviving cohort of the fittest. Females adjust to early adversity with a variety of strategies, but their escape from the risk of early mortality and morbidity has a price of increased vulnerability expressed later in development."
New insights into the role of perinatal HPA-axis dysregulation in postpartum depression,"Laura M. Glynn, Elysia Poggi Davis, Curt A. Sandman, ","Neuropeptides, Volume 47, Issue 6, December 2013, Pages 363-370, ","Postpartum depression affects 10每20% of women following birth and exerts persisting adverse consequences on both mother and child. An incomplete understanding of its etiology constitutes a barrier to early identification and treatment. It is likely that prenatal hormone trajectories represent both markers of risk and also causal factors in the development of postpartum depression. During pregnancy the maternal hypothalamic每pituitary每adrenal axis undergoes dramatic alterations, due in large part, to the introduction of the placenta, a transient endocrine organ of fetal origin. We suggest that prenatal placental and hypothalamic每pituitary每adrenal axis dysregulation is predictive of risk for postpartum depression. In this model the positive feedback loop involving the systems regulating the products of the HPA axis results in higher prenatal levels of cortisol and placental corticotropin-releasing hormone. Greater elevations in placental corticotropin-releasing hormone are related to a disturbance in the sensitivity of the anterior pituitary to cortisol and also perhaps to decreased central corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion. Secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiencies of a more extreme nature, which emerge during the prenatal period, may be predictive of an extended or more pronounced postpartum hypothalamic每pituitary每adrenal refractory period, which in turn represents a risk factor for development of postpartum depression. In addition to reviewing the relevant existing literature, new data are presented in support of this model which link elevated placental corticotropin-releasing hormone with low levels of ACTH at 3-months postpartum. Future research will further elucidate the role of hypothalamic每pituitary每adrenal axis dysregulation in postpartum depression and also whether prenatal placental and hypothalamic每pituitary每adrenal profiles might prove useful in the early identification of mothers at risk for postpartum mood dysregulation."

Thirty-seven program directors (63%) said global health was important to medical students when evaluating residency programs. Thirty-two program directors (55%) reported developing international electives. Reported barriers to resident participation in international electives were: 1) insufficient financial support, 2) inadequate resident coverage at home, and 3) lack of ACGME approval for international electives. Program directors requested more information about resident international electives, funding, and global ophthalmology educational resources. They requested ACGME recognition of international electives to facilitate resident participation.

Fetal Exposure to Maternal Depressive Symptoms Is Associated With Cortical Thickness in Late Childhood,"Curt A.

The consequences of fetal exposure to maternal depression are poorly understood. The aim of this study is to examine the association between fetal exposure to maternal depressive symptoms and cortical thickness in children 6每9 years old.A prospective, longitudinal study of maternal depressive symptoms at 19, 25, and 31 weeks＊ gestation was followed by acquisition of a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan in 81 children (age, 86.1 ㊣ 9.9 months).Significant (p < .01) cortical thinning in children primarily in the right frontal lobes was associated with exposure to prenatal maternal depression. The strongest association was at 25 weeks＊ gestation; exposure to maternal depression at 25 gestational weeks was associated with cortical thinning in 19% of the whole cortex and 24% of the frontal lobes, primarily in the right superior, medial orbital, and frontal pole regions of the prefrontal cortex (p < .01). The significant association between prenatal maternal depression and child externalizing behavior (p < .05) was mediated by cortical thinning in prefrontal areas of the right hemisphere.The pattern of cortical thinning in children exposed to prenatal maternal depression is similar to patterns in depressed patients and in individuals with risk for depression. Exposure to prenatal depression coupled with subsequent cortical thinning was associated with presence of externalizing behavior in preadolescent children and may be prodromal markers of risk for dysphoria. Vulnerability to prenatal influences at 25 gestational weeks may result from the enormous growth and dramatic structural changes in the nervous system."
Characterization of dissolved organic matter/nitrogen by fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for watershed management,"Bin Hua, John Yang, Fengjing Liu, Guocheng Zhu, Jingdong Mao, ","Chemosphere, Volume 201, June 2018, Pages 708-715, ","Characterization of dissolved organic matter/nitrogen (DOM/DON) is critical in water quality assessment and nutrient management in watershed or ecosystem. This study was to investigate the link between DOM/DON and its source using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Water samples were collected from various aquatic systems in a watershed located in central Missouri, including rural watershed with various land use and land cover (LULC), landfill, and constructed wetland. PARAFAC results based on EEM spectroscopy revealed four DOM components: two humic/fulvic acid-like components, one xenobioic-like component, and one protein-like component (f4). The f4 score was found highly correlated to LULC, indicating its distinctive EEM structure in relation to source. It is believed that the f4 score could be used as a surrogate for DOM/DON source-tracking in complex ecosystems. The nitrogen 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the solid DOM showed a close relationship between N oxidation state and its origin. The classification of the sample origins by the N oxidation state confirmed the grouping by the f4 score of EEM/PARAFAC. This study demonstrated that EEM/PARAFAC could be used as a tool for DOM/DON source tracking, point or non-point source pollution control, and understanding of DOM/DON fate and transport in complex aquatic ecosystems."

Two different perspectives are studied, i.e., that of the transportation agency and that of the household. These perspectives are linked through intermediate outputs and carry-overs generated by the underlying processes associated with each perspective. Within this context, we propose a theoretical representation of a slacks-based dynamic network DEA approach for measuring evacuation performance when a ramp closure evacuation traffic management strategy is considered. This representation requires a theoretical yet tractable conceptual framework that incorporates stakeholder perspectives, evacuation-related systems, processes and their interdependencies. This research combines the dynamic network DEA approach with traffic engineering and socio-behavioral theory of protective action. An initial exploration of the proposed approach allows for the discovery of efficiency interdependencies among perspectives, which in turn provides useful information and insights for the future design of holistic evacuation traffic management strategies."
Enhancement of macrophage inflammatory responses by CCL2 is correlated with increased miR-9 expression and downregulation of the ERK1/2 phosphatase Dusp6,"William F. Carson, Sarah E. Salter-Green, Melissa M. Scola, Amrita Joshi, Steven L. Kunkel, ","Cellular Immunology, Volume 314, April 2017, Pages 63-72, ","Macrophage polarization plays a central role in both protective immunity and immunopathology. While the role of cytokines in driving macrophage polarization is well characterized, less is understood about the role of chemokines. The purpose of this study was to determine if CC chemokine 2 (CCL2/MCP1) could influence macrophage polarization in response to subsequent activation with cytokines and microbial products. Treatment of bone marrow-derived macrophages with CCL2 alone did not result in increased expression of either classical or alternatively-activated macrophage genes as compared to standard skewing cytokines or Toll-like receptor agonists. However, subsequent stimulation of CCL2 pre-treated macrophages with classical activation stimuli resulted in enhanced expression of genes associated with classical activation. This enhancement correlated with increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 kinases, a decrease in expression of the ERK phosphatase Dusp6 and enhanced expression of miR-9. These results indicate that CCL2 supports the classical activation of macrophages, with miR-9 mediated down-regulation of Dusp6 and enhanced ERK-mediated signal transduction possibly mediating this enhanced pro-inflammatory gene expression.Download high-res image (61KB)Download full-size image"
Multiphysics coupled modeling of light water reactor fuel performance,"Rong Liu, Andrew Prudil, Wenzhong Zhou, Paul K. Chan, ","Progress in Nuclear Energy, Volume 91, August 2016, Pages 38-48, ","A fuel performance code for light water reactors called CityU Advanced Multiphysics Nuclear Fuels Performance with User-defined Simulations (CAMPUS) was developed. The CAMPUS code considers heat generation and conduction, oxygen diffusion, thermal expansion, elastic strain, densification, fission product swelling, grain growth, fission gas production and release, gap heat transfer, mechanical contact, gap/plenum pressure with plenum volume, fuel thermal and irradiation creep, cladding thermal and irradiation creep and oxidation. All the equations are implemented into the COMSOL Multiphysics finite-element platform with a 2D axisymmetric geometry of a fuel pellet with cladding. Comparisons of critical fuel performance parameters for UO2 fuel using CAMPUS are similar to those obtained from BISON, ABAQUS and FRAPCON. Additional comparisons of beryllium doped fuel (UO2-10%volBeO) with silicon carbide, instead of Zircaloy as cladding, also indicate good agreement. The capabilities of the CAMPUS code were further demonstrated by simulating the performance of oxide (UO2), composite (UO2-10%volBeO), silicide (U3Si2) and mixed oxide ((Th0.9,U0.1)O2) fuel types under normal operation conditions. Compared to UO2, it was found that the UO2-10%volBeO fuel experiences lower temperatures and fission gas release while producing similar cladding strain. The U3Si2 fuel has the earliest gap closure and induces the highest cladding hoop stress. Finally, the (Th0.9,U0.1)O2 fuel is predicted to produce the lowest fission gas release and a lower fuel centerline temperature when compared with the UO2 fuel. These tests demonstrate that CAMPUS (using the COMSOL platform) is a practical tool for modeling LWR fuel performance."

Few prospective human studies have evaluated the consequences of prenatal stress on anxiety during preadolescence. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the consequences of prenatal exposure to both maternal biological stress signals and psychological distress on anxiety in preadolescent children. Participants included 178 mother每child pairs. Maternal psychological distress (general anxiety, perceived stress, depression and pregnancy-specific anxiety) and biological stress signals were evaluated at 19, 25, and 31 gestational weeks. Anxiety was evaluated in the children at 6每9 years of age using the Child Behavior Checklist. Analyses revealed that prenatal exposure to elevated maternal cortisol, depression, perceived stress and pregnancy-specific anxiety was associated with increased anxiety in children. These associations remained after considering obstetric, sociodemographic and postnatal maternal psychological distress; factors that could influence child development. When all of the prenatal measures were considered together, cortisol and pregnancy-specific anxiety independently predicted child anxiety. Children exposed to elevated prenatal maternal cortisol and pregnancy-specific anxiety were at an increased risk for developing anxiety problems during the preadolescent period. This project identifies prenatal risk factors associated with lasting consequences for child mental health and raises the possibility that reducing maternal distress during the prenatal period will have long term benefits for child well-being."

Structural equation modeling was used to examine hypothesized pathways.Significantly positive direct pathways were found between patient-provider communication and all proximal outcomes. Only positive indirect pathways, operating through trust and motivation, were found between patient-provider communication and medication adherence.Patient-provider communication influences many desirable proximal outcomes, but only influences adherence through trust and motivation.To promote better adherence to asthma medication regimens and, ultimately positive asthma outcomes, healthcare providers can focus on implementing communication strategies that strengthen patients＊ trust and increase patient motivation to use asthma medications."

Clustering techniques identify the similarities and dissimilarities between data, and classify the data into groups with similar characteristics. Such techniques have been successfully used in market research, astronomy, psychiatry, and transportation. A framework is proposed for clustering traffic data based on fundamental traffic flow variables. Three types of clustering techniques are investigated: 1) connectivity-based clustering, 2) centroid-based clustering, and 3) distribution-based clustering. Specifically, hierarchical clustering, K-means clustering and general mixture model (GMM) were investigated.Traffic sensor data from three freeway bottleneck locations in two major U.S. metropolitan areas, St. Louis, Missouri, and Twin Cities, Minnesota, were used in the study. Various combinations of traffic variables were investigated for all three clustering techniques. The results indicated that the clustering is an effective way to partition traffic data into the free flow and congested flow regimes. Partitioned traffic data can be used to create fundamental traffic flow diagrams and macroscopic traffic stream models. Using speeds, or both speeds and occupancies as input variables produced the best clustering results. The performance of K-means and hierarchical clustering techniques were comparable to each other and they outperformed GMM clustering."
Situation assessment and decision making for lane change assistance using ensemble learning methods,"Yi Hou, Praveen Edara, Carlos Sun, ","Expert Systems with Applications, Volume 42, Issue 8, 15 May 2015, Pages 3875-3882, ","Lane change maneuvers contribute to a significant number of road traffic accidents. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that can assess a traffic situation and warn drivers of unsafe lane changes can offer additional safety and convenience. In addition, ADAS can be extended for use in automatic lane changing in driverless vehicles. This paper investigated two ensemble learning methods, random forest, and AdaBoost, for developing a lane change assistance system. The focus on increasing the accuracy of safety critical lane change events has a significant impact on lowering the occurrence of crashes. This is the first study to explore ensemble learning methods for modeling lane changes using a comprehensive set of variables. Detailed vehicle trajectory data from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset in the US were used for model development and testing. The results showed that both ensemble learning methods produced higher classification accuracy and lower false positive rates than the Bayes/Decision tree classifier used in the literature. The impact of misclassification of lane changing events was also studied. A sensitivity analysis performed by varying the accuracy of lane changing showed that the lane keeping accuracy can be increased to as high as 99.1% for the AdaBoost system and 98.7% for the random forest system. The corresponding true positive rates were 96.3% and 94.6%. High accuracy of lane keeping and high true positive rates are desirable due to their safety implications."

Multiphysics modeling of UO2-SiC composite fuel performance with enhanced thermal and mechanical properties,"Rong Liu, Wenzhong Zhou, Andrew Prudil, Paul K. Chan, ","Applied Thermal Engineering, Volume 107, 25 August 2016, Pages 86-100, ","The relatively poor thermal conductivity of the UO2 fuel is a major challenge for optimizing reactor operation and safety performance, despite its widespread use in the majority of power reactors. The already low thermal conductivity further degrades with burnup due to accumulation of defects, fission product precipitates and fission gas bubbles. The high thermal stresses cause significant pellet cracking, leading to more pellet expansion and causing pellet cladding interaction and the release of fission product gases. Mitigation of these phenomena is accomplished by limiting operating power and ramp rates at high burnup. This study presents the development of a model for UO2-SiC composite light water reactor fuel with enhanced thermal and mechanical properties to mitigate some of the material performance limitations. The model is constructed using self-defined physics modules which are fully coupled and solved using the COMSOL Multiphysics platform. Key fuel performance phenomena being considered include heat generation and conduction, species diffusion, thermomechanics (thermal expansion, elastic strain, densification, and fission product swelling strain), grain growth, fission gas production and release, gap heat transfer, mechanical contact, gap/plenum pressure with plenum volume, cladding thermal and irradiation creep and oxidation. All the equations are solved via finite-element method on a 2D axisymmetric geometry of a fuel pellet and cladding. The use of UO2-SiC will enhance thermal conductivity, which in turn will decrease nuclear fuel temperatures. This subsequently will improve fission gas retention and reduce pellet cladding interaction resulting from fuel cracking, relocation, and swelling."

Novel rodent model of breast cancer survival with persistent anxiety-like behavior and inflammation,"Leah M. Pyter, Lorena P. Suarez-Kelly, William E. Carson, Jasskiran Kaur, Savannah R. Bever, ","Behavioural Brain Research, Volume 330, 14 July 2017, Pages 108-117, ","Breast cancer survivors are an expanding population that is troubled by lasting mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. These issues reduce quality-of-life throughout survivorhood. Research indicates that tumor biology, cancer treatments, and stress contribute to these mood disturbances. Although the mechanisms underlying these various causes remain under investigation, neuroinflammation is a leading hypothesis. To date, rodent models of recurrence-free tumor survival for understanding mechanisms by which these behavioral issues persist after cancer are lacking. Here, we test the extent to which potential behavioral symptoms persist after mammary tumor removal in mice (i.e., establishment of a cancer survivor model), while also empirically testing the causal role of tumors in the development of neuroinflammatory-mediated affective-like behaviors. Complete surgical resection of a non-metastatic orthotopic, syngeneic mammary tumor reversed tumor-induced increases of circulating cytokines (IL-6, CXCL1, IL-10) and myeloid-derived cells and modulated neuroinflammatory gene expression (Cd11b, Cxcl1). Multiple anxiety-like behaviors and some central and peripheral immune markers persisted or progressed three weeks after tumor resection. Together, these data indicate that persistent behavioral changes into cancer survivorhood may be due, in part, to changes in immunity that remain even after successful tumor removal. This novel survivor paradigm represents an improvement in modeling prevalent cancer survivorship issues and studying the basic mechanisms by which cancer/cancer treatments influence the brain and behavior."
An integrated system for automatic road mapping from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery by information fusion,"Xiaoying Jin, Curt H. Davis, ","Information Fusion, Volume 6, Issue 4, December 2005, Pages 257-273, ","Here we present an integrated system for automatic mapping of urban and suburban roads from high-resolution satellite imagery. Road extraction strategies can be enriched and improved by multi-source data fusion. Fusion can occur by combining road extraction results from different image sources, or by applying multiple detectors to a single source image and then fusing the multi-detector road extraction results. Our proposed system models roads differently for urban vs. suburban environments. In suburban areas, roads are modeled as curvilinear and homogeneous regions with nearly constant width. Roads are extracted by integrating the output of two road detectors followed by a road tracker. The first detector is based on fine-scale image segmentation and grouping where road centerlines are identified and extracted using shape and structure information from the segments. This detector generates a very reliable road extraction but is incomplete as many road segments are not captured. A multi-scale curvilinear structure detector based on differential geometry is used as a complementary detector. This detector utilizes a fuzzy decision algorithm based on a 1D road profile model. The final suburban road centerlines are generated by integrating the results from the two detectors using an optimum path search algorithm. In many dense urban areas in the US, road networks are composed primarily of straight lines that form a grid structure. Here we use directional morphological filtering to mask out dark and bright structures shorter than a city block. We then use a spatial signature weighted Hough transform to generate a road grid hypothesis. The modified Hough transform incorporates spatial information derived from surrounding image pixels and can be applied to multi-spectral images. Each piece of the hypothesized road grid is then verified using homogeneity, shape, and vegetation information from the local surrounding area. Missing pieces of the road network are added using a road tracker based on profile matching. The integrated road extraction system based on the fusion of multi-detector results is tested using IKONOS multi-spectral imagery of the City of Columbia, Missouri. Evaluation of the extracted road networks using representative test sites show completeness values that range between 70% and 86% and correctness values that range between 70% and 92%."
Arsenate Adsorption on Iron-impregnated Ordered Mesoporous Carbon: Fast Kinetics and Mass Transfer Evaluation,"Zhengyang Wang, Weiming Hu, Zuheng Kang, Xiaoqing He, Baolin Deng, ","Chemical Engineering Journal, In press, accepted manuscript, Available online 10 September 2018, ","Removal of arsenic (As) from drinking water sources is much needed worldwide, and point-of-use (POU) treatment could be an effective solution for residential applications. Adopting existing removal technologies that are successful in large-scale treatment to POU units, however, is rather ineffective due to the short hydraulic residence time in POU systems. In this study, we investigated the use of iron-containing ordered mesoporous carbon (FeOMC) for rapid arsenate [As(V)] sorption in batch reactors. The OMC was prepared by an evaporation-induced self-assembly approach followed by impregnation of iron oxides, which was identified mainly as maghemite (污-Fe2O3) by coupled high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy microanalysis. A rapid kinetics of As(V) adsorption was observed, showing that at an initial concentration of 52.1 米g As/L and solid loading of 2.0 g/L, 84.8% of As(V) was removed within 90 seconds at pH 6.1. The kinetics was satisfactorily modelled according to the mass transfer of As(V) in a single FeOMC grain; and the results suggested that the intraparticle diffusion along the mesoporous channels could be hindered by adsorption. In summary, this study has not only developed ordered mesoporous materials for rapid arsenic adsorption, but also gained insights into the factors controlling the sorption kinetics by evaluating the mass transfer inside the straight and uniform channels of surface-functionalized OMC.Download high-res image (176KB)Download full-size image"
Prenatal maternal cortisol concentrations predict neurodevelopment in middle childhood,"Elysia Poggi Davis, Kevin Head, Claudia Buss, Curt A. Sandman, ","Psychoneuroendocrinology, Volume 75, January 2017, Pages 56-63, ","Glucocorticoids (cortisol in humans) are the end product of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and are proposed as a key mechanism for programming fetal brain development. The present prospective longitudinal study evaluates the association between prenatal maternal cortisol concentrations and child neurodevelopment. Participants included a low risk sample of 91 mother-child pairs. Prenatal maternal plasma cortisol concentrations were measured at 19 and 31 gestational weeks. Brain development and cognitive functioning were assessed when children were 6每9 years of age. Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired and cortical thickness was determined. Child cognitive functioning was evaluated using standardized measures (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children IV and Expressive Vocabulary Test, Second Edition). Higher maternal cortisol concentrations during the third trimester were associated with greater child cortical thickness primarily in frontal regions. No significant associations were observed between prenatal maternal cortisol concentrations and child cortical thinning. Elevated third trimester maternal cortisol additionally was associated with enhanced child cognitive performance. Findings in this normative sample of typically developing children suggest that elevated maternal cortisol during late gestation exert lasting benefits for brain development and cognitive functioning 6每9 years later. The benefits of fetal exposure to higher maternal cortisol during the third trimester for child neurodevelopment are consistent with the role cortisol plays in maturation of the human fetus. It is plausible that more extreme elevations in maternal cortisol concentrations late in gestation, as well as exposure to pharmacological levels of synthetic glucocorticoids, may have neurotoxic effects on the developing fetal brain."
Hydrodynamics of a 2D vessel including internal sloshing flows,"Wenhua Zhao, Jianmin Yang, Zhiqiang Hu, Longfei Xiao, Longbin Tao, ","Ocean Engineering, Volume 84, 1 July 2014, Pages 45-53, ","A series of two-dimensional model tests has been carried out to study the hydrodynamic performance of a floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) section including internal sloshing oscillations. The reference FLNG section is ballasted with fresh water and equivalent solid weights respectively, to clarify the coupling effects. In addition, five different ballasting conditions of the FLNG section were considered, to investigate the influence of filling levels and natural frequencies. Response amplitude operators (RAOs) of both motion responses and internal sloshing flows are calculated based on measured data. The inner-tank sloshing exhibits obvious effects on sway and roll motions, while little effects on heave motion. It is observed that the first mode of sloshing can significantly affect the global motions of the vessel, while that in higher modes shows little effects. The coupling effects are found to be sensitive to the filling levels of the tank and the roll frequencies of the vessel. Whether the internal sloshing amplifies or reduces the global motions is related to the difference between the first mode of sloshing frequency and the roll frequency of the vessel. The outcome of this study would offer better understanding on the coupled hydrodynamics of ship motions and sloshing flows."

"Rejection and modeling of arsenate by nanofiltration: Contributions of convection, diffusion and electromigration to arsenic transport","Jun Fang, Baolin Deng, ","Journal of Membrane Science, Volume 453, 1 March 2014, Pages 42-51, ","Nanofiltration (NF) membranes, DK and DL, were characterized by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, surface charge titration, pore size determination and salt rejection. The results showed both membranes have amide I and carbonyl groups on their surfaces, and have the same basic structure of polyamide layer sitting on the top of a polysulfone layer. The DK membrane carries more negative charges in the entire pH range investigated. Arsenate rejections by the NF membranes were evaluated with a crossflow test setup. The effects of pH, ionic strength, operating pressure, arsenate initial concentration on the membrane performance were investigated. Mass transfer coefficients of the membranes were determined experimentally. The Donann Steric Pore Model and concentration polarization film theory were applied to calculate the arsenic rejection rate. The rejection mechanism was interpreted by calculating the contributions of convection, diffusion, and electrostatic migration to arsenic transport through the membranes. The calculated results showed that the contribution of diffusive transport dominated at low flux, and convection and electromigrative transport, especially the latter, play an increasingly important role at a high flux."
"Trends in mortality following Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in Scotland, and excess mortality and length of stay in the hospital population, 2010 to 2016: a retrospective cohort and case-control study using linked national datasets","A-Lan Banks, Emily K. Moore, Jennifer Bishop, John E. Coia, Camilla Wiuff, ","Journal of Hospital Infection, In press, accepted manuscript, Available online 25 July 2018, ","National surveillance of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in Scotland enables the monitoring of trends in incidence rates but not mortality.All CDI cases aged ≡15 in Scotland between 2010 and 2016 (including a subset of PCR-ribotypes collected from the cases over the same period), were linked to hospital admission and mortality datasets. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with mortality (30-day all-cause). A case-control study of a hospitalised subset of cases and matched hospitalised controls assessed the impact of CDI on mortality (using conditional logistic regression) and length of stay (LOS) (using generalised linear mixed model with a gamma log link). Controls were randomly selected from the general hospital population and matched on hospital, age, sex, date of admission and LOS.30-day all-cause mortality decreased over the seven-year period (20.5% to 15.6%, p<0.001), mainly among healthcare-associated CDI (HA-CDI). Increased age, higher Charlson score, HA-CDI, as well as liver, heart and malignancy comorbidities were associated with higher mortality. No association was observed between PCR-ribotype and higher mortality, though 015 and 078 were associated with lower mortality. The adjusted OR for 30-day mortality in hospitalised CDI cases compared to controls was 2.67 (95% CI 2.42-2.94, p<0.001). While mortality declined over time in both cases and controls, the trend in ORs remained relatively stable. Having CDI increased additional mean LOS beyond infection by 22.3% (95% CI 18.0-26.8%, p<0.001).Our study has shown that CDI is associated with an almost 3-fold increase in 30-day mortality and places an increased burden on hospital resources by increasing mean LOS beyond the infection date by 22.3%. While the full cohort showed overall mortality among CDI patients decreasing, the results from the case-control study suggest that the impact of CDI on mortality or additional LOS did not improve over the 7-year period, and in fact represented an improvement among the general hospital population. Therefore, despite large declines in the incidence rate, CDI remains a serious healthcare problem. We found no evidence of an association between any one PCR-ribotype and increased mortality, though this may be due to insufficient power of the analysis due to the small numbers of typed isolates."
Evaluation of a reservation-based intersection control algorithm for hurricane evacuation with autonomous vehicles,"Yohan Chang, Praveen Edara, ","International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, In press, corrected proof, Available online 4 September 2017, ","A reservation-based intersection control algorithm was implemented for hurricane evacuation in a connected and autonomous vehicle environment. The autonomous reservation-based intersection control (AReBIC) algorithm receives and processes reservation requests from approaching vehicles in real-time and routes them free of conflict. The proposed algorithm was implemented in a simulation model of a road network in Hampton Roads, Virginia. The AReBIC algorithm outperformed the next best optimal signal control on all operational measures. The average speeds more than doubled and total delay decreased by 80%. While the total number of conflicts were comparable for AReBIC and optimal signal control, AReBIC traded the more severe crossing conflicts with less severe rear-end conflicts. The same superior performance of AReBIC was realized when transit signal priority was implemented in the study network. While the results are promising, a few practical issues should be addressed prior to any real-world implementation of reservation-based intersection control during evacuation. These issues include, latency and accuracy of communications, accommodation of pedestrians, accounting for incidents, and cybersecurity."

Polymer-matrix nanocomposite membranes for water treatment,"Jun Yin, Baolin Deng, ","Journal of Membrane Science, Volume 479, 1 April 2015, Pages 256-275, ","One of the grand challenges to sustain the modern society is to secure adequate water resources of desirable quality for various designated uses. To address this challenge, membrane water treatment is expected to play an increasingly important role in areas such as drinking water treatment, brackish and seawater desalination, and wastewater treatment and reuse. Existing membranes for water treatment, typically polymeric in nature, are still restricted by several challenges including the trade-off relationship between permeability and selectivity (also called Robeson upper boundary in membrane gas separation), and low resistance to fouling. Nanocomposite membranes, a new class of membranes fabricated by combining polymeric materials with nanomaterials, are emerging as a promising solution to these challenges. The advanced nanocomposite membranes could be designed to meet specific water treatment applications by tuning their structure and physicochemical properties (e.g. hydrophilicity, porosity, charge density, and thermal and mechanical stability) and introducing unique functionalities (e.g. antibacterial, photocatalytic or adsorptive capabilities). This review is to summarize the recent scientific and technological advances in the development of nanocomposite membranes for water treatment. The nanocomposite membranes were classified into (1) conventional nanocomposite, (2) thin-film nanocomposite (TFN), (3) thin-film composite (TFC) with nanocomposite substrate, and (4) surface located nanocomposite, based on the membrane structure and location of nanomaterial. Challenges and future research directions in developing high performance nanocomposite membranes were also discussed."

This kind of template system lessens the risks of graft harvesting complications such as patella fracture, bone graft fragmentation, suture pull out, and judgment errors pertaining to graft depth, length, or width. The Patellar Tendon Graft Guide was used to obtain a patellar tendon graft in 65 patients. Fifty-nine arthroscopic-assisted and 6 open anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were performed. Of the 65 grafts harvested, 63 consistently demonstrated bone portions 20 mm in length, 7 mm in depth, and a width corresponding to the template chosen (usually 10 mm). Two grafts supposed to be 10 mm in width turned out to be 9 mm in width because of a technique related problem."

Oxidative stress was assessed in 40 patients with CRF maintained by either haemodialysis (HD) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and in 18 healthy controls. Lipid peroxidation (assessed as malondialdehyde, MDA), total glutathione (TG), antioxidant enzyme (glutathione reductase (GSHRx), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) activity and antioxidant associated trace metal (selenium, copper, zinc) levels were studied. Erythrocyte membrane fluidity was examined using the fluorescent probe 1,6 diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH). The results indicate increased levels of oxidative stress and altered erythrocyte membrane fluidity in patients treated with CAPD compared with controls and patients treated with HD. Only minor changes were observed in patients treated with HD. Altered free radical activity, oxidative stress and altered erythrocyte membrane fluidity observed in patients with CRF may contribute to the increase in vascular disease in such patients and to the anaemia of CRF."
Molecular Characterization of Human Meningiomas by Gene Expression Profiling Using High-Density Oligonucleotide Microarrays,"Mark A. Watson, David H. Gutmann, Kelly Peterson, Michael R. Chicoine, Arie Perry, ","The American Journal of Pathology, Volume 161, Issue 2, August 2002, Pages 665-672, ","Meningiomas are common central nervous system neoplasms that exhibit remarkably diverse histopathology and biological behavior. Compared to astrocytomas, the most common central nervous system tumor, little is known about the molecular pathways critical for meningioma tumor formation and malignant progression. As an initial step toward characterizing the genetic basis of meningioma pathogenesis, we assessed cancer-related gene expression profiles of nonneoplastic leptomeningeal specimens and human meningiomas of varying World Health Organization (WHO) grade using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. Although expression profile differences between nonneoplastic and meningioma specimens were readily discernible, the expression profile of a subset of genes could also distinguish WHO grade I from WHO grades II and III tumors. Altered expression levels of several genes identified in this study have been previously noted in meningiomas (eg, growth hormone receptor, IGFBP-7, endothelin receptor A, IGF2). However, we also identified a number of novel genes whose expression was associated with WHO grade and was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in a larger, independent set of meningeal tumors (n = 47). This report represents the first gene expression profiling studies of meningiomas and identifies some initial candidate genes that may provide further insights into the genetic basis for meningioma pathogenesis."
An analytical method of predicting the response of FPSO side structures to head-on collision,"Zhenguo Gao, Zhiqiang Hu, Ge Wang, Zhe Jiang, ","Ocean Engineering, Volume 87, 1 September 2014, Pages 121-135, ","The possibility of collision between FPSO and ships exist, and consequences of such collisions can be severe. The crashworthiness of FPSO side structures must be considered in preliminary stage of structure design. In this paper, an analytical method is proposed for rapidly predicting responses of FPSO side structures in case of being struck by a ship with rigid bulbous bow. This method is particularly suitable for use in preliminary structure design phase because it is built based on a series of close-formed formulae derived using the simplified analytical method and only a few parameters are needed for calculation. The proposed analytical method is developed by combining several primary failure models of major double shell members, including the plate punching model, the plate perforating model, the plate denting model, the plate tearing model, and the X-shaped structure crushing model. Using the proposed method, curves of impact load versus indentation for three typical collision scenarios are obtained. These curves provide a detailed description of the collision process until rupture occurs in inner shell and help to evaluate crashworthiness of FPSO side structures. Accuracy of the analytical method is verified by numerical simulations using code LS_DYNA. The results of numerical simulations and those by the proposed analytical method match well."

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in water filtration membranes for desalination and other applications,"Mohammed Kadhom, Baolin Deng, ","Applied Materials Today, Volume 11, June 2018, Pages 219-230, ","Accompanying with increases in population and economic activities in the world, the demand for water grows dramatically. Sea water covers two-thirds of the earth surface, so using this source to provide potable water is logical and should be an important component to solve the water shortage problem. Additionally, technologies exist to treat waste water to meet specific water quality requirements thus its reuse should also be fully explored to address the water shortage issue. Among different methods employed for desalination and waste water treatment/reuse, pressure driven membrane technologies are very common, in which undesirable constituents in water were rejected by a selective membrane barrier. Thereby, it is very important to study and develop membranes with highest separation and operation performance for the application.Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are materials of wide interests in recent years because of their interesting chemistry and potential applications. In separation science, researchers have extensively explored the use of MOFs for gas separation and water treatment. In this review paper, we plan to examine the usage of MOFs for the membrane desalination and water treatment, a relatively narrow but increasingly important area of MOFs applications. Following a short introduction about MOFs, we would present several methods to prepare MOFs membranes, various desalination techniques and the ways of MOFs application, and finally, MOF membranes in terms of their contributions to water filtration applications such as desalination, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration. The use of MOFs in water treatment membranes is still in its infancy when compared with its applications for gas separation. Due to their structure and properties, however, MOFs had already demonstrated some amazing results enhancing membranes performance.

Trend tests using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations examined the impact of participation duration on quality. Using multivariable regression models adjusting for patient factors, hospital factors, secular trends, and GWTG-R participation duration, we assessed the association between participation duration and process composite performance. We examined 149,551 patients from 447 hospitals (2000每2012). Over the study period we saw decreases in: median age of cardiac arrest (71 to 67 years), the proportion of whites (69.2% to 66.6%), and pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation frequency (32.3% to 17.3%). Hospitals were increasingly more likely to be in urban locations and have higher nurse-to-bed ratios. Guideline performance adherence improved with participation duration for several individual process measures and overall process composite performance: process composite score (P-value trend P < .001), confirmation of endotracheal tube (P < .001 trend), monitored/witnessed event (P < .001 trend), time to first chest compressions ≒1 minute (P < .001 trend), and time to vasopressor use ≒5 minutes (P-value trend = 0.0004). There was a decrease in adherence as duration of participation increased for time to defibrillation ≒2 minutes (P-value trend = 0.005). After adjusting for several factors including calendar time, GWTG-R participation duration was independently associated with improved process composite performance (OR 1.05 per year, 95% CI 1.03每1.07).GWTG-R participation duration was associated with a significant improvement in IHCA quality of care, yet significant opportunities remain to find ways to maximize quality of care in this high-risk patient group."

Effects of Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus on the Oxidative Stress in Cultured Mesangial Cells,"S. Y. Han, K. C. Mun, H. J. Choi, C. S. Kwak, E. J. Chang, ","Transplantation Proceedings, Volume 38, Issue 7, September 2006, Pages 2240-2241, ","Cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (Tac) are two primary immunosuppressive agents used for the prevention of graft rejection. However, their use is associated with significant side effects, most notably nephrotoxicity. The mechanisms of this toxicity are not fully understood, but they seem to be associated with increases in the production of oxygen free radicals (OFRs). This present work examined the effect of CsA and Tac on the production of OFRs in cultured rat renal mesangial cells (RMCs).Varying concentrations of CsA and Tac (0 to 40 米mol/L) were added to RMCs and incubated for 60 minutes at 37∼C. The production of OFRs was evaluated by measuring the fluorescent product from the oxidation of an oxidant-sensitive 2∩, 7∩-dichlorofluorescin.At 60 minutes, the relative fluorescence units (RFU) for OFRs production in RMCs exposure to CsA were increased by 2.5%, 11.5%, 22.5%, 57.2%, and 174% at 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 米mol/L, respectively. Tac increased the RFU by 15.9%, 13.6%, 14.8%, 13.2%, 21.4%, 13.2%, and 28.1% at 0.1, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 米mol/L, respectively. In RMCs, the RFU produced by CsA was higher than that by Tac.The results of this experiment suggest that CsA and Tac induced renal injury by OFRs."
Apoptosis by Cyclosporine in Mesangial Cells,"S. Y. Han, E. J. Chang, H. J. Choi, C. S. Kwak, K. C. Mun, ","Transplantation Proceedings, Volume 38, Issue 7, September 2006, Pages 2244-2246, ","The immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine (CsA) is widely used to treat allograft rejection and various autoimmune disorders. A major limiting factor in the use of CsA is chronic nephrotoxicity. The pathogenesis of CsA-induced nephrotoxicity is not fully understood. Several recent studies have suggested that CsA treatment directly induces apoptosis in several cell types. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of CsA on apoptosis of cultured rat mesangial cells (RMCs).RMCs were treated with CsA at concentrations of 0.1 to 40 米mol/L. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Apoptotic protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis.Cell viability was decreased with increasing concentrations of CsA in dose-dependent manner. CsA produced dose-dependent induction of p53, caspase-6, and Bax protein expression. CsA treatment caused proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 and induced the degradation of 116-kDa PARP into 89-kDa fragment. RMCs with CsA reduced Bcl-2 and cIAP expression.In this study, CsA induced apoptosis by up-regulating proapoptotic factors, caspase-3 and -6, p53, Bax, cleaving PARP, and down-regulating antiapoptotic factor, Bcl-2, and cIAP. These results suggested that the increased cell apoptosis exerted by CsA may be one of the mechanisms promoting CsA-induced nephrotoxicity."

At 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10 days after hepatectomy of Sprague-Dawley rats, blood was obtained into a capillary tube from a tail vein. Total antioxidant status and total production of oxygen free radicals were measured using the Randox kit, a colorimetric method, and the Free Radical Analytical System. We also measured the amount of malonyldialdehyde, which provides an indirect index of oxidative injury.The level of malonyldialdehyde after hepatectomy was higher compared with that before hepatectomy. The level of total oxygen free radicals after hepatectomy was higher compared with that before hepatectomy. Total antioxidant status after hepatectomy was lower compared with that before hepatectomy.The results suggested that the damage by OFRs to the regenerating liver was caused by increased production of OFRs and decreased antioxidant defense against OFRs."

The reforms merged training institutions into universities and greatly expanded enrolment of health professionals. Positive achievements include an increase in the number of graduates to address human resources shortages, acceleration of production of diploma nurses to correct skill-mix imbalance, and priority for general practitioner training, especially of rural primary care workers. These developments have been accompanied by concerns: rapid expansion of the number of students without commensurate faculty strengthening, worries about dilution effect on quality, outdated curricular content, and ethical professionalism challenged by narrow technical training and growing admissions of students who did not express medicine as their first career choice. In this Review we underscore the importance of rebalance of the roles of health sciences institutions and government in educational policies and implementation. The imperative for reform is shown by a looming crisis of violence against health workers hypothesised as a result of many factors including deficient educational preparation and harmful profit-driven clinical practices."
Increased yield stability of field-grown winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) varietal mixtures through ecological processes,"Henry E. Creissen, Tove H. Jorgensen, James K. M. Brown, ","Crop Protection, Volume 85, July 2016, Pages 1-8, ","Crop variety mixtures have the potential to increase yield stability in highly variable and unpredictable environments, yet knowledge of the specific mechanisms underlying enhanced yield stability has been limited. Ecological processes in genetically diverse crops were investigated by conducting field trials with winter barley varieties (Hordeum vulgare), grown as monocultures or as three-way mixtures in fungicide treated and untreated plots at three sites. Mixtures achieved yields comparable to the best performing monocultures whilst enhancing yield stability despite being subject to multiple predicted and unpredicted abiotic and biotic stresses including brown rust (Puccinia hordei) and lodging. There was compensation through competitive release because the most competitive variety overyielded in mixtures thereby compensating for less competitive varieties. Facilitation was also identified as an important ecological process within mixtures by reducing lodging. This study indicates that crop varietal mixtures have the capacity to stabilise productivity even when environmental conditions and stresses are not predicted in advance. Varietal mixtures provide a means of increasing crop genetic diversity without the need for extensive breeding efforts. They may confer enhanced resilience to environmental stresses and thus be a desirable component of future cropping systems for sustainable arable farming."

Influence of the CeO2 and Nb2O5 supports and the inert gas in ethanol steam reforming for H2 production,"Isabela Dancini-Pontes, Marcos DeSouza, Fernando Alves Silva, Mara Heloisa Neves Olsen Scaliante, N芍dia Regina Camargo Fernandes-Machado, ","Chemical Engineering Journal, Volume 273, 1 August 2015, Pages 66-74, ","The increasing importance of environmentally friendly processes leads to science in search of new technologies, like the generation of electrical power from hydrogen in fuel cells. Thus, a good alternative for producing hydrogen is ethanol steam reforming, since ethanol comes from a renewable resource. Hydrogen production from ethanol steam reforming was evaluated for the CuNi/CeO2 and CuNi/Nb2O5每Na catalysts with and without nitrogen as the carrier gas. For the catalyst supported in ceria, the presence of inert favored the steam reforming reaction with a small increased in the conversion of ethanol. Additionally, the reduction ability of ceria, in the conditions tested, enabled the formation of acetone through the interaction of molecules with the support. For Nb2O5 supported catalyst, the presence of inert showed lower conversion. It happened because filamentous coke the drag with some metal particles, and higher selectivity to H2. Coke formation was observed for both catalysts, but only CuNi/Nb2O5每Na presented sintering. The catalysts presented distinct behaviors, due to their markedly different support characteristics. The presence of N2 in the reactional system influences expressively the distribution of products and the ethanol conversion for both catalysts tested. The carrier gas can favor the selectivity of H2 and the ethanol steam reforming reaction, depending on the support used."
Cytokine Array After Cyclosporine Treatment in Rats,"K. B. Jin, H. J. Choi, H. T. Kim, E. A. Hwang, K. C.

Cytokines are known to play an important role in innate immunity, apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell growth, and differentiation. They are known to be involved in most disease processes, including cancer, cardiac disease, and nephrotoxicity. To evaluate changes of cytokines in a rat model of CsA-induced chronic nephrotoxicity, we performed a cytokine array.Experiments were performed on two groups of rats; normal control group and CsA-treated group. Cytokine array in rat serum was performed using Cytokine Antibody Array I kit from RayBiotech.Serum creatinine, urine creatinine, and creatinine clearance increased in the CsA-treated group. Among the several cytokines, the expressions of the lipopolysaccharide-induced CXC chemokine (LIX), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), nerve growth factor (汕-NGF), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in the CsA-treated group were increased above that of cytokines in the control group. The density of the LIX in controls was 0.62, and in the CsA-treated group was 1.24. The density of the MCP-1 in controls was 0.68, and in CsA-treated, 1.43.

Analyses were conducted by comparing various measures of alcohol involvement in violent versus accidental injuries. The results supported temporal sequence of events and specificity. The odds ratios of violent versus accidental injury for a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over 80 mg% were significant for each country, ranging from 2.77 for Mexico to 9.45 for Canada, which supports both the strength of associations and the consistency of findings. No third variables were found from the logistic regression analysis that better explain the relationships between alcohol and violence. A significant dose每response relationship between BAC level and violence was also found. All analyses conducted point to a causal role of alcohol in injuries related to violence."

Groups I and IV were sham-operated animals; groups II and V were subjected to 45 minutes of renal I/R; and groups III and VI received 10 mg/kg EGCG intravenously at the time of reperfusion. Three days after renal I/R, we compared renal function markers, malondialdehyde (MDA), and histologic changes.Following renal I/R, levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (sCr) were increased and serum creatinine clearance (CrCl) decreased in group V compared to group II (P < .001). Those receiving EGCG treatment (groups III and VI) had decreased BUN and sCr compared to non-EGCG I/R groups (P < .001), but not surprisingly, higher than sham groups.

Data were collected by systematic street observations and interviews with motorcyclists and supplemented with motorcycle injury data from a 1 month study of all patients coming to emergency departments in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Observations show that 89% of motorcycle drivers (N = 9242) wore helmets; only 20% of the passengers (N = 3541) did. However, only 55% of the drivers wore helmets correctly (e.g. with chin strap buckled). Differences in time and place were noted in interviews when motorcyclists reported wearing helmets least at night and when no police were around; various reasons for not wearing helmets included physical discomfort and absence of police surveillance. Data from emergency departments found that motorcycles were involved in 64% of all traffic accident injuries, comprising 33% of total trauma patients presenting to emergency departments. Injury Severity Scores were calculated for the 26% of motorcycle injuries which were admitted to the hospital, with 60% having scores of 1每8, 27% 9每15, and 9% > 15. We conclude that although motorcycle drivers appear to comply with the motorcycle helmet law, it is a ※token compliance.§ Less than 50% of riders were maximally protected by helmets and very little safety consciousness was found among drivers. Suggestions for improving helmet use that take cultural definitions of wearing helmets into account are presented for future research."

HIV-associated bone marrow changes,"Kristin Henry, Christine Costello, ","Current Diagnostic Pathology, Volume 1, Issue 3, September 1994, Pages 131-141, ","Following the recognition of AIDS and the identification of HIV 〞 the retrovirus responsible for its causation, it became apparent that abnormalities of bone marrow (BM) are commonly associated with abnormal peripheral blood findings in HIV infected patients. Anaemia, granulocytopaenia and thrombocytopaenia are frequently present and are reflected by the dyshaematopoiesis found in BM. Both bone marrow aspiration (BMA) and bone marrow trephine biopsies (BMTB) reveal alterations in cellularity (most often hypercellularity), dysplasia of 1, 2 or 3 cell lines; inflammatory and stromal reactions, opportunistic infections (OI) and involvement by high grade lymphomas. The mechanisms responsible for the haematological abnormalities in HIV positive individuals are numerous and are not mutually exclusive; they include the CDC class of the disease, the effects of treatment, the presence of infection and lymphoma (and other malignant diseases), immunological mechanisms and damage to BM cells (stromal cells, stem cells, differentiated macrophages and megakaryocytes) as a result of their direct infection by HIV. Although more pronounced abnormalities are seen in patients with advanced HIV disease who are likely to be taking marrow-toxic drugs and in whom OI and malignancies are common, it is emphasized that important BM changes are present in HIV positive patients who at the time of biopsy do not have evidence of infection or neoplastic disease and who have not received treatment for their positive HIV status. The cell line which most frequently shows changes in haematopoesis is the megakaryocytic lineage; of these changes, the presence of increased numbers of naked megakaryocytic nuclei (NMN) are a consistent and specific feature. The finding of BM changes in patients at an early stage of HIV disease points to either the direct effect of HIV infection of BM cells or to abnormal cytokine production or both."
Harnessing macrophage-mediated degradation of gelatin microspheres for spatiotemporal control of BMP2 release,"Ramkumar T. Annamalai, Paul A. Turner, William F. Carson, Benjamin Levi, Jan P. Stegemann, ","Biomaterials, Volume 161, April 2018, Pages 216-227, ","Biomaterials-based approaches to harnessing the immune and inflammatory responses to potentiate wound healing hold important promise. Bone fracture healing is characterized by an acute inflammatory phase, followed by a transition to a regenerative and repair phase. In this study, we developed genipin-crosslinked gelatin microspheres designed to be preferentially degraded by inflammatory (M1) macrophages. Highly crosslinked (>90%) microspheres allowed efficient incorporation of bioactive bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), a potent stimulator of osteogenesis in progenitor cells, via electrostatic interactions. Release of BMP2 was directly correlated with degradation of the gelatin matrix. Exposure of microspheres to polarized murine macrophages showed that degradation was significantly higher in the presence of M1 macrophages, relative to alternatively activated (M2) macrophages and unpolarized controls. Microsphere degradation in the presence of non-inflammatory cells resulted in very low degradation rates. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMPs) by macrophages were consistent with the observed phenotype-dependent degradation rates. Indirect co-culture of BMP2-loaded microspheres and macrophages with isolated adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) showed that M1 macrophages produced the strongest osteogenic response, comparable to direct supplementation of the culture medium with BMP2. Controlled release systems that are synchronized with the inflammatory response have the potential to provide better spatiotemporal control of growth factor delivery and therefore may improve the outcomes of recalcitrant wounds."

In the ACT IV study, we aimed to assess whether or not the addition of rindopepimut to standard chemotherapy is able to improve survival in patients with EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma.In this randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 18 years and older with glioblastoma from 165 hospitals in 22 countries. Eligible patients had newly diagnosed glioblastoma confirmed to express EGFRvIII by central analysis, and had undergone maximal surgical resection and completion of standard chemoradiation without progression. Patients were stratified by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer recursive partitioning analysis class, MGMT promoter methylation, and geographical region, and randomly assigned (1:1) with a prespecified randomisation sequence (block size of four) to receive rindopepimut (500 米g admixed with 150 米g GM-CSF) or control (100 米g keyhole limpet haemocyanin) via monthly intradermal injection until progression or intolerance, concurrent with standard oral temozolomide (150每200 mg/m2 for 5 of 28 days) for 6每12 cycles or longer. Patients, investigators, and the trial funder were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival in patients with minimal residual disease (MRD; enhancing tumour <2 cm2 post-chemoradiation by central review), analysed by modified intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01480479.Between April 12, 2012, and Dec 15, 2014, 745 patients were enrolled (405 with MRD, 338 with significant residual disease [SRD], and two unevaluable) and randomly assigned to rindopepimut and temozolomide (n=371) or control and temozolomide (n=374). The study was terminated for futility after a preplanned interim analysis. At final analysis, there was no significant difference in overall survival for patients with MRD: median overall survival was 20﹞1 months (95% CI 18﹞5每22﹞1) in the rindopepimut group versus 20﹞0 months (18﹞1每21﹞9) in the control group (HR 1﹞01, 95% CI 0﹞79每1﹞30; p=0﹞93). The most common grade 3每4 adverse events for all 369 treated patients in the rindopepimut group versus 372 treated patients in the control group were: thrombocytopenia (32 [9%] vs 23 [6%]), fatigue (six [2%] vs 19 [5%]), brain oedema (eight [2%] vs 11 [3%]), seizure (nine [2%] vs eight [2%]), and headache (six [2%] vs ten [3%]). Serious adverse events included seizure (18 [5%] vs 22 [6%]) and brain oedema (seven [2%] vs 12 [3%]). 16 deaths in the study were caused by adverse events (nine [4%] in the rindopepimut group and seven [3%] in the control group), of which one〞a pulmonary embolism in a 64-year-old male patient after 11 months of treatment〞was assessed as potentially related to rindopepimut.Rindopepimut did not increase survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

Busulfan Triggers Intrinsic Mitochondrial-Dependent Platelet Apoptosis Independent of Platelet Activation,"Jianlin Qiao, Yulu Wu, Yun Liu, Xiaoqian Li, Kailin Xu, ","Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Volume 22, Issue 9, September 2016, Pages 1565-1572, ","As a nonspecific alkylating antineoplastic agent, busulfan has been widely used in the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated busulfan-induced cell apoptosis. Whether busulfan triggers platelet apoptosis remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the role of busulfan in platelet apoptosis. Isolated human platelets were incubated with busulfan followed by analysis of platelet apoptosis by flow cytometry or western blot, including mitochondrial depolarization, expression of Bcl-2, and Bax and caspase 3 activation. Meanwhile, platelet activation, expression of glycoprotein Ib汐 (GPIb汐), glycoprotein VI (GPVI), and <alpha>IIb<beta>3 and platelet aggregation in response to collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were measured. Additionally, busulfan was injected into mice with or without administration of caspase inhibitor QVD-Oph to investigate its effect on platelet lifespan. Our results showed that busulfan-treated platelets displayed increased mitochondrial membrane depolarization, decreased expression of Bcl-2, increased expression of Bax and caspase 3 activation in dose-dependent manner, which were inhibited by QVD-Oph. Platelet activation was not observed in busulfan-treated platelets as showed by no increased P-selectin expression and PAC-1 binding. However, busulfan reduced collagen- or ADP-induced platelet aggregation without affecting expression of GPIb汐, GPVI, and <alpha>IIb<beta>3. Furthermore, busulfan reduced circulating platelet lifespan which was ameliorated by QVD-Oph in mice. In conclusion, busulfan triggers mitochondrial-dependent platelet apoptosis and reduces platelet lifespan in mice. These data suggest targeting caspase activation might be beneficial in the prophylaxis of platelet apoptosis-associated thrombocytopenia after administration of busulfan."

The IL-2S protein was found to remarkably promote the proliferation of pig lymphoblasts than the native pig IL-2 protein. Then the IL-2S gene was cloned into VR1020 eukaryotic plasmid (VRIL2S) and enwrapped with chitosan nanoparticles (CNP-VRIL2S). Twenty-one day old female Kunming mice were muscularly inoculated respectively with the CNP-VRIL2, CNP-VRIL2S and CNP-VR1020 along with Pasteurella multocida vaccine, and orally challenged with virulent Pasteurella multocida on 28 days post-vaccination. The blood was weekly collected to detect the change of IgG, IgA, IgM, specific antibody, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6 by ELISA. The immunoglobulins, specific antibody and interleukins significantly increased in CNP-VRIL2S group compared with the control mice after vaccination and challenge, and 9 of 10 immunized mice survived challenge, while the all control mice manifested severe symptoms and lesions, and finally died of infection. These indicated that VRIL2S entrapped with CNP is a novel safe and effective adjuvant to boost the specific immunity and resistance of animal against infectious pathogen, which could facilitate the development of highly promising powerful adjuvant."

This study examined the ability of CsA to induce apoptosis in a rat osteoblast cell line.We induced apoptosis in rat osteoblastic ROS 17/2.8 cells by exposure to CsA. MTT assay showed that CsA exhibited significant cytotoxic effects on ROS 17/2.8 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis showed enhanced processing of caspase-8, Bax, and p53 after CsA treatment. Expression of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was elevated by CsA treatment. Pro-caspase-3 and Bcl-2 proteins were decreased by CsA.These results suggested that CsA induced apoptosis of osteoblasts."
Effects of Cyclosporine on the Production of the Reactive Oxygen Species in the Glial Cells,"K. C. Mun, K. T. Lee, H. J. Choi, K. B. Jin, Y. H. Kim, ","Transplantation Proceedings, Volume 40, Issue 8, October 2008, Pages 2742-2743, ","After organ transplantation, some patients suffer mild neurological symptoms such as tremor to severe complications including seizures and encephalopathy. Among the immunosuppressants, cyclosporine (CsA) can induce neurological side effects. However, the mechanisms of encephalopathy by CsA are not fully understood. We measured the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the glioma cells after CsA treatment.CsA (2.5 mmol/L) added to glioma cells was incubated for 60 minutes at 37∼C. ROS production was evaluated by measuring the fluorescent product from the oxidation of an oxidant-sensitive 2∩,7∩-dichlorofluorescin using VICTOR3 multilabel counter.CsA resulted in ROS production by glioma cells. The ROS production increased with the time of exposure to CsA.These findings indicated that CsA may contribute to neurological side effects via ROS production."
MicroRNA dysregulation in melanoma,"Nicholas Latchana, Akaansha Ganju, J. Harrison Howard, William E. Carson, ","Surgical Oncology, Volume 25, Issue 3, September 2016, Pages 184-189, ","Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Current challenges facing the management of melanoma include accurate prediction of individuals who will respond to adjuvant therapies as well as early detection of recurrences. These and other challenges have prompted investigation into biomarkers that could be used as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic aids. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small 19每22 nucleotide RNA inhibitors of protein translation. Over 800 different miRs are present within cells and importantly miR expression profiles may vary across different cells types and stages of malignancy. Unique expression profiles have been described for malignant melanoma; however, this work has yet to be translated into routine clinical practice. We highlight pertinent studies involving common miRs implicated in the oncogenesis of melanoma including miR-21, miR-125b, miR-150, miR-155, miR-205, and miR-211. In particular, emphasis is placed upon differential expression across different stages of melanoma progression, prognostic implications and potential mechanistic involvement. Focused efforts on inhibition of these miRs could be the most efficient method of translating preclinical endeavors into clinically meaningful applications."

Research on unloading nonlinear mechanical characteristics of jointed rock masses,"Jianlin Li, Lehua Wang, Xingxia Wang, Ruihong Wang, Li Dang, ","Journal of Rock Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Volume 2, Issue 4, 15 December 2010, Pages 357-364, ","Geological environments of rock mass projects are always very complicated, and further investigations on rock mechanical characteristics are needed. There are considerable distinctions in rock mechanical characteristics under unloading and loading conditions. A series of tests are conducted to study the stress-strain relationship of rock masses under loading and unloading conditions. Also, the anisotropy, the size effect, and the rheological property of unloading rock mass are investigated. The tests presented in the paper include model test and granite rheological test, which are conducted considering geological condition, rock mass structure, in-situ stress field of the permanent shiplock of the Three Gorges Project. The main differences between loading and unloading rock masses are stress paths, yield criteria, deformation and strength parameters, etc.. Different structural plane directions affect unloading rock mass evidently. With increasing size, the tensile strength, the compressive strength, the deformation modulus, the Poisson＊s ratio and the anisotropy of rock mass all decrease. For sandstone samples with parallel bedding planes, the cohesion c increases but the internal friction angle 耳 decreases under unloading condition when compared with the values under loading condition. While for samples with vertical bedding planes, the trend is adverse. The rheological property of rocks has close relationship with the tensile stresses of rock masses. When the sandstone samples are tested under high stress condition, their rheological properties are very obvious with the unloading of confining pressure, and three typical rheological stages are shown. Rheological rate changes with the variations in axial stress and confining pressure."

For linear sloshing problems associated with liquid storage tanks, in most cases, like the upright tanks of arbitrary uniform cross section, the horizontal tanks of arbitrary uniform cross-section and the axisymmetric tanks of arbitrary meridian shape, by employing SBFEM the sloshing analysis can be greatly simplified. Only one dimensional discretization is needed, thus the computational effort is reduced to a great extent, whereas high accuracy of the results is ensured. Numerical examples validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach."

The key observation is that the c-axis coherence length is longer than the c-axis lattice constant even at zero temperature. This means that the superconducting order parameter of one CuO2 plane overlaps with those of neighboring CuO2 planes all the temperatures below Tc."

The modeling of iceberg material is crucial for ice mechanics, and the main objective of the present work is to propose an isotropic elastic每perfectly plastic material model to simulate the mechanical behavior of ice in a ship-iceberg collision scenario for Accidental Limit State conditions. The ＆Tsai-Wu＊ yield surface model and a new empirical failure criterion were used to describe the plastic flow of iceberg material, while a cutting-plane algorithm was adopted to address the plastic stress每strain relationship. The proposed iceberg material model was incorporated into the LS-DYNA finite element code using a user-defined subroutine. Calibration of the proposed material model was conducted through a comparison with an abnormal level ice event pressure-area curve. The calculated pressure-area curve was comparable to that recommended by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) rule. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted, and the proposed ice model was found to be more sensitive to the mesh size than to other parameters. Numerical simulations of iceberg-tanker side and iceberg-ship bow collisions were also analyzed. Moreover, the impact force and energy dissipation were examined. The results from these simulations showed that the proposed isotropic elastic每perfectly plastic iceberg material model can be employed to simulate iceberg behavior in ship-iceberg collisions under Accidental Limit State conditions."

MBP SOI LDMOS has two gates, the planar gate and the trench gate. The big feature of MBP LDMOS is the multiple buried p-layers with intervals in the drift region which is an arithmetic progression and decreases successively. Firstly, double gates of the structure form dual current conduction channels, leading to a low specific on-resistance (Ron,sp). Secondly, the multiple buried p-layers form a more significant triple RESURF effect, which not only increases the drift doping concentration but also modulates the electric field of the drift region, resulting in a low Ron,sp and a high breakdown voltage (BV). MBP SOI LDMOS is thus owning a reduced Ron,sp and an improved BV. The effects of structure parameters on the device performances are investigated. Compared with the conventional SOI LDMOS, the Ron,sp of MBP SOI LDMOS is reduced by 52.5% with BV increasing by 36.4% at the same 16-米m-drift region."
Signaling pathways involved in MDSC regulation,"Prashant Trikha, William E. Carson, ","Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Reviews on Cancer, Volume 1846, Issue 1, August 2014, Pages 55-65, ","The immune system has evolved mechanisms to protect the host from the deleterious effects of inflammation. The generation of immune suppressive cells like myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that can counteract T cell responses represents one such strategy. There is an accumulation of immature myeloid cells or MDSCs in bone marrow (BM) and lymphoid organs under pathological conditions such as cancer. MDSCs represent a population of heterogeneous myeloid cells comprising of macrophages, granulocytes and dendritic cells that are at early stages of development. Although, the precise signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms that lead to MDSC generation and expansion in cancer remains to be elucidated. It is widely believed that perturbation of signaling pathways involved during normal hematopoietic and myeloid development under pathological conditions such as tumorogenesis contributes to the development of suppressive myeloid cells. In this review we discuss the role played by key signaling pathways such as PI3K, Ras, Jak/Stat and TGFb during myeloid development and how their deregulation under pathological conditions can lead to the generation of suppressive myeloid cells or MDSCs. Targeting these pathways should help in elucidating mechanisms that lead to the expansion of MDSCs in cancer and point to methods for eliminating these cells from the tumor microenvironment."

A hybrid reference frames method is established that combines the rotating reference frame method and an added momentum source method. The computational domain is separated into two parts under the rotating reference frame and the inertial frame respectively. A single mesh is needed for all conditions of a testing model such as different rotating arm radius, pitch angles and drift angles. The validation is carried out based on the numerical simulations on the flow fields around the SUBOFF models including sterns and full appended models. Results show that the stability derivatives of the yawing moment and yawing force agree well with the experimental data. Using a dimensional analysis method, the influences of the rotating arm radius and linear velocity are investigated. The similarity is maintained when the radius is constant, and the rotating effect performs strongly when the radius is small. The effects of pitch angle and drift angle are also discussed when the linear velocity is fixed with the fully appended SUBOFF model."

Measurement of dimensionless soot extinction constant using a gravimetric sampling technique,"Zhi-Qiang Zhou, Tasleem U. Ahmed, Mun Y. Choi, ","Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science, Volume 18, Issue 1, September 1998, Pages 27-32, ","The dimensionless extinction constant, Ke, of post-flame soot from rich acetylene/air premixed flames was measured using a simultaneous gravimetric-sampling and light extinction technique at a wavelength of 632.8 nm. The average value of Ke is 8.5 with a standard deviation of 0.5. An important improvement in the present method include the reduction in the uncertainty of the extinction pathlength and uniformity of the soot concentration in the probed region. Several aspects of the experimental procedure which can potentially introduce errors in the measured Ke were evaluated. Results indicate that Ke is only moderately influenced by the sampling flowrate and that the variation is minimized when flowrates are maintained close to isokinetic conditions. It is demonstrated that moisture condensation within the sampling probe, if disregarded, can produce large errors in Ke."
Simultaneous laser-induced emission of soot and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within a gas-jet diffusion flame,"Randall L. Vander Wal, Kirk A. Jensen, Mun Y. Choi, ","Combustion and Flame, Volume 109, Issue 3, May 1997, Pages 399-414, ","Simultaneous images of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and laser-induced incandescence (LH) visualization of soot concentrations are presented for laminar gas-jet diffusion flames. Spatially integrated measurements reveal similar spectral emission for LIF and LII, but vastly different time scales associated with radiative decay. Comparison of spatially resolved images using either 266-nm or 1064-nm excitation light reveals distinct regions of molecular fluorescence and soot incandescence. Consideration of photophysical properties of PAHs suggests that the fluorescence wavelength distribution is dependent on the size of the PAH. Using different detection spectral bands, spatially resolved regions attributed to different-sized PAHs are presented. The spatial distribution of PAH size is consistent with the putative growth mechanisms of PAHs. In the region between the LIF due to PAHs and LII due to soot, a dark zone is observed that is attributed to the presence of soot precursor particles. Current understanding of soot formation indicates that through both physical and/or chemical condensation, large PAHs react first to form soot precursor particles prior to the formation of soot particles. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of thermophoretically collected material from within this dark region confirmed the presence of soot precursor particles 2 to 5 nm in diameter."
Measurement of the mass specific extinction coefficient for acetylene and ethene smoke using the large agglomerate optics facility,"George W. Mulholland, Mun Y. Choi, ","Symposium (International) on Combustion, Volume 27, Issue 1, 1998, Pages 1515-1522, ","The mass specific extinction coefficient, 考s of smoke produced from acetylene and ethene fuel burned under laminar and turbulent conditions was measured using the Large Agglomerate Optics Facility. Key design features that enable a threefold reduction in the uncertainty compared with previous measurements include a 10-times longer pathlength, less than 0.05% drift in the light intensity ratio steady-state smoke generation and dilution, accurate flow calibration, and more precise filter weight measurements. The measurements of 考s are consistent with previous results obtained for smoke from a variety of fuels for both small- and large-scale fires. Specifically, the 考s, of 7.80 m2/g for acetylene smoke produced by a turbulent flame using the new apparatus, is in excellent agreement with 7.82 m2/g as reported by Choi et al. [3] for the same fuel. However, these values are significantly larger than the value of 4.5 m2/g obtained from the study of Wu et al. [7] for acetylene smoke from turbulent flames. The reliability of the present experimental measurements is supported by an absolute calibration using an aerosol comprised of particles of known size, density, and refractive index. The measured values of 考s, in this study appear to be inconsistent with the values of the refractive index of smoke widely used in the combustion community.Measurements of the specific extinction coefficient for acetylene and ethene smoke indicate that 考s depends on fuel type but displays little dependence on flame conditions (laminar or turbulent cases). For ethene smoke, the average specific extinction coefficient is 12% higher than for acetylene smoke. The larger 考s may be due to a beam-shielding effect that is dependent on the primary particle size and the number of spheres comprising an agglomerate."

Soot was sampled at 0.2 and 0.5 s after ignition for a 2.1 mm droplet burning in atmospheric pressure air. The measured primary particle sizes were significantly larger under microgravity conditions compared to normal gravity and were found to increase with residence time. The average radius of gyrations were also larger for soot collected in microgravity conditions. Differences in the particle and agglomerate dimensions are believed to be caused by the longer residence times. The fractal dimensions were found to be nearly constant for all experiments while the prefactor term was found to increase slightly with residence time."
Estimating the height of wetland vegetation using airborne discrete-return LiDAR data,"Sheng Nie, Cheng Wang, Xiaohuan Xi, Shezhou Luo, Jianlin Tian, ","Optik, Volume 154, February 2018, Pages 267-274, ","Several studies have been conducted to estimate wetland vegetation height using airborne LiDAR data. However, no studies have been conducted to explore the influence of vegetation cover on vegetation height estimation models. The objective of this research is to estimate vegetation height in wetlands with varying vegetation cover for further analyzing the effects of vegetation cover. First, we performed both linear and logarithmic regression analyses between field-measured heights and each LiDAR-derived metric in wetlands with different vegetation cover. Then LiDAR-derived metrics were combined through multiple regression analysis to estimate wetland vegetation height. The height estimates were finally validated by leave-one-out cross-validation method. The results showed that the logarithmic regression analysis performed better than the linear regression analysis in estimating wetland vegetation height for almost all LiDAR-derived metrics regardless of vegetation cover. The max height of LiDAR returns (Hmax) provided the best agreement with field-measured heights in wetlands with high vegetation cover. In contrast, the strongest correlation was observed using the standard deviation of LiDAR heights (HSD) for low vegetation cover. Results of multiple regression analysis indicated that the best model was based on Hmax and 90 percentile height of LiDAR returns (H90) in wetlands with high vegetation cover, while the best model can be expressed as a function of HSD and H90 for low vegetation cover. Therefore, our study concluded that vegetation cover is an important factor of vegetation height models. Additionally, our study will provide valuable guidance for field-measured data collection and vegetation height estimation using LiDAR data."
Modified access polynomial based self-healing key management schemes with broadcast authentication and enhanced collusion resistance in wireless sensor networks,"Xinjiang Sun, Xiaobei Wu, Cheng Huang, Zhiliang Xu, Jianlin Zhong, ","Ad Hoc Networks, Volume 37, Part 2, February 2016, Pages 324-336, ","Though lots of research results about self-healing key management under unreliable links have been proposed, there are still some shortcomings, such as the inefficiency of broadcasts, lack of broadcast authentication, limited sessions for key issues, disastrous risks of access polynomials, and the vulnerability of collusion attacks. In this paper, we propose two modified access polynomial based self-healing key management schemes with broadcast authentication and enhanced collusion resistance. First, two kinds of attacks are introduced to break the security of access polynomials. Then, a modified security model is given, and collusion resistance capability is redefined from the perspective of session interval from node revocation to node addition, which does not depend on the number of collusive nodes. Next, based on sliding window and modified access polynomial, Sch-I and Sch-II are proposed to achieve the security and tolerate packet losses, which allow pairwise keys between member nodes and group manager to be updated dynamically. Finally, theoretical analysis validates that the proposed schemes have 汛 self-healing capability, any-wise forward security and backward security, and enhanced collusion resistance capability, and can also avoid the flaws of access polynomials and reduce the resource consumption. Compared with existing schemes, they are quite suitable for practical applications."

The results show that Chinese inter-provincial Gini ratio of fossil energy consumption is below 0.3 in recent years, and change in per capita energy consumption is the key factor behind the decline in the overall Gini index. Unlike existing studies based only on annual flows of energy consumption, this paper also focuses on cumulative energy consumption. Moreover, decomposing annual and cumulative consumption Gini coefficients by type, group, and incremental variation is rarely seen in other studies. Based on the above positive analysis, the paper provides some policymaking suggestions."

Histone demethylase KDM5A inhibits glioma cells migration and invasion by down regulating ZEB1,"Bin Dai, Hui Huang, Feng Guan, Guangtong Zhu, Zhiqiang Hu, ","Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, Volume 99, March 2018, Pages 72-80, ","Malignant gliomas are highly lethal cancers worldwide as tumor cells infiltrate to healthy brain tissue invariably. Histone demethylase KDM5A as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in cancer still has been controversial. KDM5A may have a different function in different type cancer cells. However, the specific roles of KDM5A in the progression of glioma remain undiscovered. In this study, we found that compared with primary glioma, metastasis glioma had low KDM5A levels. Besides, lower KDM5A levels were linked to poor survival in glioma cancer patients, indicating that KDM5A is a new prognostic marker for glioma cancer. KDM5A knockdown increases the invasive abilities of glioma cancer cells and changes the EMT markers. A mechanism, KDM5A suppressing the expression of ZEB1, and its catalytic activity is indispensable for anti-invasive function. Our study revealed that histone demethylase KDM5A exerts anti-invasiveness function partly through repressing oncogenic ZEB1 expression by mediating H3K4 demethylation. We also demonstrate that ZEB1 play a crucial role in KDM5A induced function. In summary, in this study, we showed that KDM5A has a crucial role in glioma and therefore may serve as a novel therapeutic target and prognostic marker in glioma."

Epitope-tagged recombinant SamCystin and Bicc1 proteins were transiently transfected into inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells and co-immunoprecipitated. The results showed that SamCystin self-associates, Bicc1 and SamCystin interact, the mutation responsible for PKD in the Han:SPRD-Cy rat disrupts the self-association of SamCystin but not the Bicc1每SamCystin interaction, and RNA may be an important component of the Bicc1每SamCystin complex.

Synthesis and studies of axial chiral bisbenzocoumarins: Aggregation-induced emission enhancement properties and aggregation-annihilation circular dichroism effects,"Shaojin Chen, Wei Liu, Zhaohai Ge, Wenxuan Zhang, Zhiqiang Hu, ","Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy, Volume 193, 15 March 2018, Pages 141-146, ","Axial chiral bisbenzocoumarins were synthesized for the first time by converting naphthanol units in 1,1∩-binaphthol (BINOL) molecule to the benzocoumarin rings. The substitute groups on 3,3∩-positions of bisbenzocoumarins showed significant influence on their aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AEE) properties. It was also found that BBzC1 with ester groups on 3,3∩-positions exhibit an abnormal aggregation-annihilation circular dichroism (AACD) phenomenon, which could be caused by the decrease of the dihedral angle between adjacent benzocoumarin rings in the aggregation state. The single crystal structure of BBzC1 showed that the large dihedral angle in molecule prohibited the strong 羽-羽 stacking interactions, which could be main factors for its AEE properties.The aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AEE) effect and aggregation-annihilation circular dichroism (AACD) effect of bisbenzocoumarins are studied.Download high-res image (164KB)Download full-size image"
"Local characteristics, contestability, and the dynamic structure of rural banking: A market study","Mike Devaney, Bill Weber, ","The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, Volume 35, Issue 3, Autumn 1995, Pages 271-287, ","If a market is perfectly contestable, incumbent firms in even highly concentrated markets will produce a level of output consistent with a welfare maximum. Alternatively, if a market is imperfectly contestable, the conduct of intumbent firms will be influenced by the degree of actual and potential competition. The results of our simultaneous, two-equation model of bank behavior and actualized potential competition lead to the conclusion that rural banking markets are imperfectly contestable. This finding suggests that rural bank policy should continue to promote both actual and potential competition."
Aberrant Epigenetic Gene Regulation in Lymphoid Malignancies,"Kristen H. Taylor, Aaron Briley, Zheng Wang, Jianlin Cheng, Charles W. Caldwell, ","Seminars in Hematology, Volume 50, Issue 1, January 2013, Pages 38-47, ","In lymphoid malignancies, aberrant epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications influence chromatin architecture and can result in altered gene expression. These alterations commonly affect genes that play important roles in the cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The ability to identify epigenetic modifications to these important genes has increased exponentially due to advances in technology. As a result, there are well-defined, gene-specific epigenetic aberrations associated with NHL comprising follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The identification of these genes is important because they may be used as biomarkers for prognosis, diagnosis and in developing improved treatment strategies. Also important, in the control of gene expression, is the packaging of DNA within the nucleus of a cell. This packaging can be distorted by epigenetic alterations and may alter the accessibility of certain regions of the genome in cancer cells. This review discusses the impact of known epigenetic aberration on the regulation of gene expression in NHL and provides insight into the spatial conformation of the genome (DNA packaging) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia."

The authors subsequently performed direct examination and categorization of CPR legislation in 39 states (several states passed legislation as of September 2017). Survey results indicated differing practices with regard to CPR instruction in areas such as course content (63% perform automated external defibrillator training), instructor (47% used CPR-certified teachers/coaches, 30% used other CPR-certified instructors, 11% used noncertified teachers/coaches), and method (7% followed American Red Cross methods, 55% followed American Heart Association methods). CPR laws differ, although almost all (97%) require hands-on training. Although hands-on practice during CPR instruction in high school is required by law in the majority of U.S. states, there is currently no standardized method of implementation.Download high-res image (681KB)Download full-size image"

Experimental comparisons of dynamic properties of floating wind turbine systems based on two different rotor concepts,"Fei Duan, Zhiqiang Hu, Geliang Liu, Jin Wang, ","Applied Ocean Research, Volume 58, June 2016, Pages 266-280, ","This article presents research findings on the response characteristic differences between the thrust-matched blade system (TMBS) and the geometry-matched blade system (GMBS), which utilize redesigned thrust-matched and original geometry-matched blades, respectively, both based on the OC3 spar-type floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT). Particulars of this research are to examine the unique dynamic response characteristics of the TMBS, which includes a better performance-matched rotor relative to the GMBS. The response behaviors of the TMBS and GMBS are compared and studied based on a sequence of wind and irregular wave scenarios to reveal the unique roles that the thrust-matched rotor plays in the dynamic response behaviors of the floating wind turbine system. Gyroscopic effects of rotor rotation are found weakened in the TMBS, and yaw oscillation in the TMBS is not solely excited by rotor rotation, unlike in the GMBS. Coupling effects between surge and pitch are found in both the TMBS and GMBS under combined wind-and-wave condition. Furthermore, restraining effects of wind loads on motions in the GMBS and TMBS are both evident at natural frequencies while show distinct behaviors at the wave frequency. It is observed from the experimental measurements that the tower-top bending moment of the TMBS shows similar oscillation characteristics as that of the GMBS but with larger oscillation amplitudes. Furthermore, it is found that tower-top shear force and axial rotor thrust of the TMBS show distinct exciting motivators and much larger oscillation amplitudes relative to those of the GMBS. For both the TMBS and GMBS, the tensions measured in mooring lines are found to be coupled by yaw motion for wind-only cases while being clearly influenced by surge and heave couplings under integrated wind-and-wave load condition."

Density power law and structures of metallic glasses,"Min Wu, Jianlin Cheng, John S. Tse, Yuanming Pan, Lin Zhang, ","Acta Materialia, Volume 141, December 2017, Pages 75-82, ","The existence of a universal power law relating the position of the first sharp diffraction peak (q, FSDP) to the density (老 or the volume V) with a constant exponent <3 has been debated in the last decade. A constant dimensionality is important because it reflects the fractal topology of the glass structures. In this study, the validity of the Ehrenfest equation applied to multi-component metallic glasses is examined using first-principles molecular dynamics calculations. The results show that the Ehrenfest coefficient depends on the local structures of the glasses and is not a constant for all glasses. Moreover, since the diffraction pattern is determined by the scattering between atom pairs, in a multi-component glass, the X-ray diffraction FSDP is only sensitive to the heavy atoms, and the observed P-q relationship does not necessary correspond to the PV equation of state of the bulk material and is not always a suitable indicator for monitoring structural phase transitions or volume changes. On the other hand, for suitable systems, neutron diffraction is a reliable method to determine the structural features of both heavy and light atoms. In this study, the simulated neutron diffraction patterns of Ca72﹞7Al27.3 metallic glasses show a clear splitting of the FSDP at the pressure where the pressure-induced polyamorphism transition occurs. From the presented results, there is no justification for expecting the existence of a universal power scaling law with a constant exponent for all glasses.Download high-res image (265KB)Download full-size image"
Improving accuracy and efficiency of stress analysis using scaled boundary finite elements,"Gao Lin, Lin Pang, Zhiqiang Hu, Yong Zhang, ","Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements, Volume 67, June 2016, Pages 26-42, ","The scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is a fundamental-solution-less boundary element method, which leads to semi-analytical solutions for stress fields. As only the boundary is discretized, the spatial dimension is reduced by one. In this paper, the SBFEM based polygon elements are utilized to improve the accuracy and efficiency of stress analysis. It retains the attractive feature of the SBFEM in solving problems with unbounded media and singularities. In addition, polygon elements are more flexible in meshing and mesh transition. Various measures which help improving accuracy or efficiency of the stress analysis, i.e. refining polygon mesh, nodal enrichment, appropriate placing of the scaling center, merging polygon elements and NURBS enhanced curved boundaries are discussed and compared. As a result, further insight into the refinement and improvement strategies for stress analysis is provided."

A research on a following day load simulation method based on weather forecast parameters,"Nianping Li, Kuan Wang, Jianlin Cheng, ","Energy Conversion and Management, Volume 103, October 2015, Pages 691-704, ","Accurate simulation and forecast of cooling load is vital in the design of efficient cooling in a cold storage system. In order to be more accurate in predictions and reduce simulation errors, most of previous studies have focused on how to improve the methodology of load forecast or how to correct the annual meteorological parameters library in face of global warming. Although such approaches can improve the accuracy of load forecast, they still have major weaknesses, such as their requirement of large amount of daily or hourly historical load records and their failure to predict weather data for any given day accounting for future change in the macro climate. To address these problems, a following day load simulation method (FDLS) is proposed by the authors in this research. This method simulates the cooling load based on weather forecast parameters published by meteorological authorities. The accuracy of FDLS is validated by comparing the simulation results with the actual data collected from a cold storage building. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of the FDLS method are highlighted in this study."

Results of cultures performed on aqueous and vitreous specimens obtained at presentation were categorized as follows: gram-positive coagulase-negative micrococci, ""other"" gram-positive, gram-negative, and equivocal/no growth.Results: Eleven features of the initial clinical presentation were associated with significant differences in the microbiologic spectrum (P < 0.05). Baseline factors correlating with higher rates of both gram-negative and other gram-positive isolates were: corneal infiltrate, cataract wound abnormalities, afferent pupillary defect, loss of red reflex, initial light perception-only vision, and symptom onset within 2 days of surgery. Gram-negative organisms did not grow in any eyes in which a retinal vessel could be visualized, and 61.9% of these eyes had equivocal or no growth. Diabetes mellitus was associated with a higher yield of gram-positive, coagulase-negative micrococci. Eye pain was not a discriminator for culture results.Conclusions: The presenting characteristics of acute endophthalmitis after cataract surgery may be helpful in predicting the most likely culture results. Such predictions do not appear sufficiently strong to guide the initial empiric choice of intravitreal antibiotics."

Functionally relevant biological information such as protein sequences, gene expression, and protein每protein interactions has been used mostly separately for protein function prediction. One of the major challenges is how to effectively integrate multiple sources of both traditional and new information such as spatial gene每gene interaction networks generated from chromosomal conformation data together to improve protein function prediction.In this work, we developed three different probabilistic scores (MIS, SEQ, and NET score) to combine protein sequence, function associations, and protein每protein interaction and spatial gene每gene interaction networks for protein function prediction. The MIS score is mainly generated from homologous proteins found by PSI-BLAST search, and also association rules between Gene Ontology terms, which are learned by mining the Swiss-Prot database. The SEQ score is generated from protein sequences. The NET score is generated from protein每protein interaction and spatial gene每gene interaction networks. These three scores were combined in a new Statistical Multiple Integrative Scoring System (SMISS) to predict protein function. We tested SMISS on the data set of 2011 Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA). The method performed substantially better than three base-line methods and an advanced method based on protein profile每sequence comparison, profile每profile comparison, and domain co-occurrence networks according to the maximum F-measure."

The demand for power has increased significantly in Ghana over the years, resulting in an annual power-supply crisis since 1983. Thus, the country has had increasing difficulties in meeting the demand of domestic and industrial consumers and export commitments to neighboring countries. The wood waste associated with sawmilling activities in Ghana is of two categories: forest residues (leftovers from forest cutting) and residues from the wood-processing mills. The chapter discusses specific conditions for utilizing wood waste from wood-processing industries in cogeneration for a project. The feasibility of the project is discussed under the framework of the clean development mechanism (CDM), which also includes the boundary and baseline for the project, the carbon offsets as certified emissions reductions (CERs) expected, and the outstanding issues that need to be solved to allow full implementation of the project. The project seeks to make use of abundant resources currently perceived as a nuisance to the environment, while also offering an opportunity for power generation."
Diversity and degrees of freedom in regression ensembles,"Henry WJ Reeve, Gavin Brown, ","Neurocomputing, Volume 298, 12 July 2018, Pages 55-68, ","Ensemble methods are a cornerstone of modern machine learning. The performance of an ensemble depends crucially upon the level of diversity between its constituent learners. This paper establishes a connection between diversity and degrees of freedom (i.e. the capacity of the model), showing that diversity may be viewed as a form of inverse regularisation. This is achieved by focusing on a previously published algorithm Negative Correlation Learning (NCL), in which model diversity is explicitly encouraged through a diversity penalty term in the loss function. We provide an exact formula for the effective degrees of freedom in an NCL ensemble with fixed basis functions, showing that it is a continuous, convex and monotonically increasing function of the diversity parameter. We demonstrate a connection to Tikhonov regularisation and show that, with an appropriately chosen diversity parameter, an NCL ensemble can always outperform the unregularised ensemble in the presence of noise. We demonstrate the practical utility of our approach by deriving a method to efficiently tune the diversity parameter. Finally, we use a Monte-Carlo estimator to extend the connection between diversity and degrees of freedom to ensembles of deep neural networks."

Based on time-domain explicit expressions of dynamic responses, a new and more concise time-domain explicit expression of response sensitivity is derived using the direct differentiation method (DDM). Then a more efficient algorithm for direct construction of the explicit expression of response sensitivity is developed based on the physical meanings of the coefficient matrices in the formulation. The adjoint variable method (AVM) is further used to establish the explicit expression of the sensitivity of an arbitrary response. Finally, based on the time-domain explicit expressions for both dynamic response and its sensitivity, an efficient time-domain approach is proposed to calculate the sensitivity of variance responses of a structure subjected to non-stationary random excitations. Numerical examples of different structural systems under non-stationary random excitations are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method."

Among the many processes involved in atherogenesis, oxidative stress and modification of low density lipoprotein has been assigned a major role. This in turn may be affected by the immunosuppressive regime used. We studied oxidative stress in 40 renal transplant patients receiving two different immunosuppressive regimens (20 on cyclosporin, 20 on azathioprine/prednisolone), and 19 normal controls. Changes in lipid peroxidation (assessed as thiobarbituric acid reacting substances, TBARS), antioxidant enzyme activities (glutathione reductase GSHPx, glutathione peroxidase GSHPx and superoxide dismutase SOD) vitamin E and antioxidant associated trace metals (selenium, copper, zinc) were studied. Alteration of erythrocyte membrane fluidity was examined using the fluorescent probe 1,6 diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH). Both transplant groups showed no difference in TBARS, lipid standardised vitamin E, copper or selenium compared to controls. Zinc was significantly increased in both the cyclosporin and azathioprine groups compared to controls (P<0.05). SOD was reduced in both transplant groups compared to controls (P<0.001). GSHPx was elevated in both groups compared to controls but only reached significance in the azathioprine treated group (P<0.005). GSHRx was slightly elevated in both transplant groups but did not reach significance. Erythrocyte membrane anisotropy was decreased in the cyclosporin treated group (P<0.05). There was no difference in the azathioprine group compared to controls. The present results suggest an adaptive response to increased oxidative stress in both transplant groups sufficient to minimise markers of oxidative stress (TBARS and anisotropy). The results also suggest no significant difference between the two immunosuppressive regimes with regard to oxidative stress."

Research and development of compressible foam for pressure management in casing annulus of deepwater wells,"Zhiqiang Hu, Jin Yang, Wenlong Li, Shuzhan Li, Yanyu Xin, ","Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Volume 166, July 2018, Pages 546-560, ","Casing annulus pressure build-up owing to fluid thermal expansion in sealed annuli severely threaten the casing safety and wellbore integrity of deepwater wells. To mitigate the annular pressure with stronger effect and lower cost, a new type of syntactic foam with high compression ratio, which consists of hollow glass microspheres and a resin matrix system, was developed in this study. It can provide extra space for the annular fluid to expand when the annular pressure exceeds the specific foam crush pressure, allowing the foam to collapse and consequently, mitigate the annular pressure. The foam compression behavior is divided into three stages according to a hydrostatic compression test, and the annular pressure is mainly influenced by the microspheres volume and temperature. To optimize the parameters of the compressible foam, a novel model considering fluid thermal expansion, casing elastic deformation, and foam compression behavior in multi-annuli is established. The results indicate that the compressible foam can reduce the trapped annular pressure effectively and permanently. In a case study well, the annular pressure no longer exceeds the maximum acceptable annular pressure in each annulus with optimized design of the foam wraps and a suitable number of installed foam casing joints."

The association between negative affectivity and outdoor play was moderated by sex; in boys, for every 1-point increase in negative affectivity score, mean outdoor play decreased by 4.7 minutes per day. There was no significant association in girls. Surgency was associated with outdoor play; for every 1-point increase in surgency/extraversion, outdoor play increased by 4.6 minutes per day.Young children's temperamental characteristics were associated with their participation in outdoor free play. Consideration of temperament could enhance interventions and strategies to increase outdoor play in young children. Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between children's early temperament and physical activity."

Plastic mechanism analysis of structural performances for stiffeners on bottom longitudinal web girders during a shoal grounding accident,"Zhaolong Yu, Zhiqiang Hu, Ge Wang, ","Marine Structures, Volume 40, January 2015, Pages 134-158, ","A theoretical model is introduced in this paper for structural performance of stiffeners on double-bottom longitudinal girders in a shoal grounding accident. Major emphasis is placed on establishing the characteristic deformation mechanism of stiffeners and identifying major energy dissipation patterns. Numerical simulations using the LS-DYNA nonlinear finite-element program were carried out to examine thoroughly the progressive deformation process during sliding deformation. Stiffener deformations were observed to fall into two categories: stiffeners fully contacted with the indenter, and stiffeners subjected to indirect deformation due to energy transfer from attached girders. Grounding performance of stiffeners is substantially influenced by that of the attached plating, and therefore a review of the existing deformation models of longitudinal girders (i.e. Simonsen 1997, Midtun 2006 and Hong 2008) was included. Hong's model of bottom girders was found not capable of representing the effects of stiffeners, and a new model of girders was thus developed. Based on observation of the numerical deformation process and the new analytical girder model, a kinematically admissible model of stiffeners on bottom longitudinal girders was built. Using the methods of plastic mechanism analysis, simplified analytical expressions for energy dissipation by girder-attached stiffeners, both fully contacted and noncontacted, were formulated, and equations for grounding resistance were subsequently obtained. The theoretical expressions agree favorably with results from nonlinear finite-element simulations and capture two significant characteristics of the problem: that energy varies little with indentation for stiffeners that fully contacting the indenter, and that energy is independent of slope angle for indirectly deformed stiffeners. The proposed theoretical model helps to predict analytically shoal grounding performance of stiffeners on longitudinal girders with reasonable accuracy."

Do Mexican immigrants substitute health care in Mexico for health insurance in the United States? The role of distance,"Henry Shelton Brown, ","Social Science & Medicine, Volume 67, Issue 12, December 2008, Pages 2036-2042, ","Although language and culture are important contributors to uninsurance among immigrants, one important contributor may have been overlooked 每 the ability of immigrants to return to their home country for health care. This paper examines the extent to which uninsurance (private insurance and Medicaid) is related to the ability of immigrants to return to Mexico for health care, as measured by spatial proximity. The data for this study are from the Mexican Migration Project. After controlling for household income, acculturation and demographic characteristics, arc distance to the place of origin plays a role in explaining uninsurance rates. Distance within Mexico is quite important, indicating that immigrants from the South of Mexico are more likely to seek care in their communities of origin (hometowns)."
Biofouling on mooring lines and power cables used in wave energy converter systems〞Analysis of fatigue life and energy performance,"Shun-Han Yang, Jonas W. Ringsberg, Erland Johnson, Zhiqiang Hu, ","Applied Ocean Research, Volume 65, April 2017, Pages 166-177, ","This study presents an analysis of a wave energy converter (WEC) system consisting of a buoy, a mooring system, and a power cable connected to a hub. The investigated WEC system is currently under full-scale testing near Runde in Norway. The purpose of the study was to investigate the characteristics of the entire system, primarily with regard to energy performance and the fatigue life of the mooring lines and power cable, considering the effects of marine biofouling and its growth on the system＊s components. By means of parametric study, the energy performance and fatigue life of the mooring lines and power cable were investigated considering two mooring configurations, three biofouling conditions, four sea states in a scatter diagram, and three wave and current directions. Hydrodynamic and structural response simulations were conducted in a coupled response analysis using the DNV-GL software SESAM. Energy performance analyses and stress-based rainflow counting fatigue calculations were performed separately using an in-house code. The results show that, for a WEC system which has been deployed for 25 years, biofouling can reduce the total power absorption by up to 10% and decrease the fatigue life of the mooring lines by approximately 20%."
Coupled analysis of integrated dynamic responses of side-by-side offloading FLNG system,"Dongya Zhao, Zhiqiang Hu, Ke Zhou, Gang Chen, Xingya Feng, ","Ocean Engineering, Volume 168, 15 November 2018, Pages 60-82, ","Integrated dynamic responses of FLNG system in side-by-side offloading operation are investigated numerically and experimentally in this paper. A numerical code is developed based on potential flow theory to predict the interactions between connected vessels' motions and liquid sloshing in the time domain. The impulsive response function (IRF) method is adopted in the resolution for 6 DOF vessels' motions, nonlinear sloshing in liquid tanks is solved using boundary element method (BEM), and connection system including hawsers and fenders is numerically modeled as linear response system. A series of model tests are conducted to validate the feasibility of the numerical code. Hydrodynamic interaction between the vessels and shielding effects under different wave directions are analyzed; sloshing effects on the vessels' motions and on the loads of connection system are investigated; the sensitivities of the vessels' motions and loads to connection system stiffness are discussed. It is found that the vessels' motions are significantly affected by the hydrodynamic interactions between vessels and sensitive to wave directions for shielding effects. The radiation forces of the adjacent vessel tend to amplify vessel's motions and LNG carrier is more likely to be affected by FLNG's radiation forces for their difference in displacement. In addition, compared with solid loading condition, liquid loading vessel tends to have decreased natural roll frequency and have increased sway motions in the frequency region that higher than the natural sloshing frequency. The two sloshing responses peaks appear in the natural roll frequencies and natural sloshing frequencies, which are respectively mainly excited by vessels' roll and sway motions. Besides, in low fill conditions, the sloshing loads contribute to larger sway motions in low fill conditions for the natural sloshing frequencies are closer to the main response frequency region of vessels. Sloshing nonlinearity gets obvious in the conditions with low fill conditions and large wave amplitude, while the motion responses of vessels have slight nonlinearity with the increases of sloshing nonlinearity when no violent sloshing with wave break is excited. Furthermore, small stiffness of the connection system has slight influences on the vessels' motions, and resonant motions can be excited when the natural frequency of the connection system located in the wave frequency region."
A novel nonlinear solution for the polygon scaled boundary finite element method and its application to geotechnical structures,"Kai Chen, Degao Zou, Xianjing Kong, Andrew Chan, Zhiqiang Hu, ","Computers and Geotechnics, Volume 82, February 2017, Pages 201-210, ","The polygon scaled boundary finite element method is semi-analytical and known for its high precision. However, the material nonlinearity cannot be maintained because this method uses an analytical solution in the radial direction. In this paper, a novel nonlinear algorithm is developed by introducing internal Gaussian points over a subdomain. The response of nonlinearity for a concrete-faced rockfill dam is modeled. The results correspond well with the results from finite element modelling, which demonstrates the method can be used to describe the nonlinear characteristics of geomaterials. Furthermore, this method offers promising flexibility for analyzing complex geometries without decreasing the precision."

Silver nanoparticles in aquatic environments: Physiochemical behavior and antimicrobial mechanisms,"Chiqian Zhang, Zhiqiang Hu, Baolin Deng, ","Water Research, Volume 88, 1 January 2016, Pages 403-427, ","Nanosilver (silver nanoparticles or AgNPs) has unique physiochemical properties and strong antimicrobial activities. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the physicochemical behavior (e.g., dissolution and aggregation) and antimicrobial mechanisms of nanosilver in aquatic environments. The inconsistency in calculating the Gibbs free energy of formation of nanosilver [忖Gf(AgNPs)] in aquatic environments highlights the research needed to carefully determine the thermodynamic stability of nanosilver. The dissolutive release of silver ion (Ag+) in the literature is often described using a pseudo-first-order kinetics, but the fit is generally poor. This paper proposes a two-stage model that could better predict silver ion release kinetics. The theoretical analysis suggests that nanosilver dissolution could occur under anoxic conditions and that nanosilver may be sulfidized to form silver sulfide (Ag2S) under strict anaerobic conditions, but more investigation with carefully-designed experiments is required to confirm the analysis. Although silver ion release is likely the main antimicrobial mechanism of nanosilver, the contributions of (ion-free) AgNPs and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to the overall toxicity of nanosilver must not be neglected. Several research directions are proposed to better understand the dissolution kinetics of nanosilver and its antimicrobial mechanisms under various aquatic environmental conditions.Download high-res image (204KB)Download full-size image"

Results: Surveys were returned by 97 (55%) hospitals. Hospitals with a greater number of emergency department visits were significantly more likely to have a clinical pathway, to have given t-PA, and to be better prepared for stroke treatment. After multivariate analysis, greater number of stroke patients per year (P < .001) and availability of skilled intensive care department staff (P = .056) were associated with hospital t-PA use. Conclusions: Specific hospital characteristics are associated with t-PA use. Consideration of these may be used to devise new strategies for improved delivery of acute stroke treatment."

Five 2-day conditioning trials were conducted over 10 consecutive days. On 1 day of each trial, animals received an infusion of amphetamine (0, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg/0.5 ml/side) and were placed into a distinct compartment for 30 min. On the other day, animals received sham intracranial infusions and were placed into a different compartment for 30 min. Locomotion and stereotypies were assessed following the first and last amphetamine infusions. CPP was assessed the day following the last conditioning trial. Intra-VLS infusions of amphetamine did not alter sniffing or locomotion. Acute administration of amphetamine into the VLS dose dependently produced oral stereotypies, however, tolerance developed to this effect following repeated administrations. Also, intra-VLS infusions of amphetamine dose dependently produced CPP. These results suggest that the VLS is involved in amphetamine-induced oral stereotypies and reward."

A rapid and sensitive method for the determination of amphetamine in human plasma samples using gas chromatography with electron-capture detection was developed in our laboratory to follow the time course of amphetamine levels in patients receiving this drug as part of a study using amphetamine as a model for mania. Methods: Blood samples were taken from healthy male volunteers at 30, 60, 90, 150, 210, 240, and 480 min after administration of 25 mg of (+)-amphetamine. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation and used for the analysis. This method is a modification of the procedure described by Paetsch et al. [J. Chromatogr. 573 (1992) 313] for the determination of amphetamine in rat brain tissue. Amphetamine was derivatized under basic conditions using pentafluorobenzenesulfonyl chloride (PFBSC) prior to analysis on a gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column and an electron-capture detector. The internal standard used was benzylamine. The structure of the amphetamine derivative was confirmed using combined gas chromatography每mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results: The limit of detection was <1 ng/ml, and the method was linear in the 1- to 100-ng range used. Mean amphetamine levels peaked at 3.5 h after drug administration, and were 40.8㊣1.5 ng/ml at that time. Discussion: This procedure produces a stable derivative with excellent chromatographic properties and is both simple and reproducible."
Coupling analysis between vessel motion and internal nonlinear sloshing for FLNG applications,"Dongya Zhao, Zhiqiang Hu, Gang Chen, Xiaobo Chen, Xingya Feng, ","Journal of Fluids and Structures, Volume 76, January 2018, Pages 431-453, ","The coupling interaction between vessel motions and internal tank sloshing is of vital importance for Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) system design and operation due to the exposure to diverse sea states at any filling level. A numerical code based on potential flow is developed in this study to investigate the coupling interaction between 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) vessel motions and internal nonlinear sloshing. The impulsive response function (IRF) method is adopted in the resolution for the 6 DOF vessel motions, and internal liquid sloshing is numerically solved with the boundary element method (BEM). The coupling interaction between vessel motions and internal sloshing is calculated in the time domain through an iteration strategy. For the purpose of validating the code and enabling a perceptual understanding of these coupling effects, experimental tests of a vessel with two rectangular tanks are conducted. The proposed code is also validated by previous numerical and experimental results. In addition, the coupling interaction characteristics of internal liquid sloshing and vessel motions are studied, and the sensitivities of coupling effects to filling levels and wave directions are also analyzed. Decreased natural roll motion frequency and response amplitude are excited in the liquid loading condition more than in the solid loading condition; sway motion has a decreased response in the natural sloshing frequency and a response peak in the frequency region that is higher than the natural sloshing frequency; heave motion is not sensitive to sloshing loads. Phase shift analysis reveals that phase shifts between the wave and the sloshing loads change rapidly near the natural roll frequency and natural sloshing frequency. Furthermore, the natural sloshing frequency varies with changes in the filling level, and the coupling effects become obvious when the natural sloshing frequency is close to main response frequency region of the vessel. Moreover, coupling effects under head wave conditions have similar properties to those under beam sea conditions, but the sensitivity of pitch motion to sloshing is much lower than that of roll motion."
Styrene/potassium persulfate/water systems: effects of hydrophilic comonomers and solvent additives on the nucleation mechanism and the particle size,"Jinn-Luh Ou, Jia-Kuen Yang, Hui Chen, ","European Polymer Journal, Volume 37, Issue 4, April 2001, Pages 789-799, ","Emulsifier-free emulsion polymerizations based on styrene/potassium persulfate/water (St/kps/H2O) in the presence of a relatively hydrophilic comonomer, such as vinyl acetate (VAc) or methyl methacrylate (MMA), or the nonpolar solvent, such as ethyl acetate (EAc) or methyl isobutyrate (MIB) having structural similarity with VAc and MMA respectively, or the polar solvent such as glycerin or acetone etc., have been carried out. From the gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) analysis of polymers obtained in the presence of VAc or MMA comonomer, or even MIB or EAc nonpolar solvent, the presence of oligomers having the molecule weight of 1000 at the early stage of polymerization suggests a micellar nucleation mechanism. From the study for effects of additives on the rate of polymerization, we found that all curves for the conversion versus time showed concave upward at about the conversion of 45% but level off at about 80%. Moreover, when the polar or nonpolar solvent was used as an additive, a controllable particle size of monodisperse microspheres with the ranges 270每750 nm could be expected. Besides, the particle size of monodisperse microspheres was decreased with increasing of the addition amount of the polar solvent. Monosize polystyrene microspheres with smaller particle sizes can be obtained by adding of the polar solvent; on contrary, microspheres with larger particle sizes can be generated by a limited addition amount of the nonpolar solvent."

However, few comprehensive and wide-ranging experiments have been conducted to characterize biomass-burning pollutants in Southeast Asia (SEA) or assess their regional impact on meteorology, the hydrological cycle, the radiative budget, or climate change. Recently, BASE-ASIA (Biomass-burning Aerosols in South-East Asia: Smoke Impact Assessment) and the 7-SEAS (7-South-East Asian Studies)/Dongsha Experiment were conducted during the spring seasons of 2006 and 2010 in northern SEA, respectively, to characterize the chemical, physical, and radiative properties of biomass-burning emissions near the source regions, and assess their effects. This paper provides an overview of results from these two campaigns and related studies collected in this special issue, entitled ※Observation, modeling and impact studies of biomass burning and pollution in the SE Asian Environment§. This volume includes 28 papers, which provide a synopsis of the experiments, regional weather/climate, chemical characterization of biomass-burning aerosols and related pollutants in source and sink regions, the spatial distribution of air toxics (atmospheric mercury and dioxins) in source and remote areas, a characterization of aerosol physical, optical, and radiative properties, as well as modeling and impact studies. These studies, taken together, provide the first relatively complete dataset of aerosol chemistry and physical observations conducted in the source/sink region in the northern SEA, with particular emphasis on the marine boundary layer and lower free troposphere (LFT). The data, analysis and modeling included in these papers advance our present knowledge of source characterization of biomass-burning pollutants near the source regions as well as the physical and chemical processes along transport pathways. In addition, we raise key questions to be addressed by a coming deployment during springtime 2013 in northern SEA, named 7-SEAS/BASELInE (Biomass-burning Aerosols & Stratocumulus Environment: Lifecycles and Interactions Experiment). This campaign will include a synergistic approach for further exploring many key atmospheric processes (e.g., complex aerosol每cloud interactions) and impacts of biomass burning on the surface每atmosphere energy budgets during the lifecycles of biomass-burning emissions.Download high-res image (314KB)Download full-size image"

The fuel cell outputs a programmed power regardless of whether the power converter interface operates in the grid-connection mode or in the stand-alone mode. The programmed power outputted from the fuel cell is the average power of load under the stand-alone mode. The battery set is used to respond to the varied power of loads under the stand-alone mode. A prototype is developed to verify the performance of power converter interface, and the experimental results are as expected."

Baker-Zander, Jeanne M. Shaffer, Sheila A. Lukehart, ","FEMS Immunology and Medical Microbiology, Volume 6, Issue 4, April 1993, Pages 273-279, ","Serum pools were collected from rabbits bled at various times after intra-testicular infection with Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum. These were tested for their ability to opsonize T. pallidum and promote killing of the organisms by macrophages. Compared to normal sera, significant opsonization was first seen on day 10 of infection as measured by both ingestion (P < 0.001) and macrophage-mediated killing (P = 0.006); significant levels of functional antibodies persisted through 300 days of infection. Although opsonic activity peaked early in infection, antibodies that promoted optimal macrophage-mediated killing developed much later, suggesting that these two functions may represent activities of antibodies with differing specificities or affinities. The initial development of antibodies that augment both phagocytosis and killing corresponds with the in vivo clearance of treponemes from the primary site of infection. These observations support the hypothesis that macrophages are the major effector mechanism for elimination of T. pallidum during early syphilis infection."
Least upper bounds for probability measures and their applications to abstractions,"Rohit Chadha, Mahesh Viswanathan, Ramesh Viswanathan, ","Information and Computation, Volume 234, February 2014, Pages 68-106, ","Least upper bounds play an important role in defining the semantics of programming languages, and in abstract interpretations. In this paper, we identify conditions on countable ordered measurable spaces that ensure the existence of least upper bounds for all sets of probability measures. These conditions are shown to be necessary as well 〞 for any measurable space not satisfying these conditions, there are (finite) sets of probability measures for which no least upper bound exists. For measurable spaces meeting these conditions, the existence of least upper bounds is established constructively. Based on this least upper bound construction, we present a novel abstraction method applicable to Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMCs), Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs). The main advantage of the new abstraction techniques is that the resulting abstract models are purely probabilistic that may be more amenable to automated analysis than models with both nondeterministic and probabilistic transitions which arise from previously known abstraction techniques."

Baker, Sheila Mishra, ","CATENA, Volume 26, Issues 1每2, February 1996, Pages 85-98, ","An anomalous multiple channel pattern in bedrock is observed on a predominantly downcutting reach of the Narmada River. The multi-channel reach (800每2750 m in width and 8500 m in length) is bounded by major faults, and is underlain by granite and gneiss bedrock. Geomorphological investigations reveal differences among the upstream, middle and downstream sub-reaches of the multi-channel study area. Whereas the upstream sub-reach is dominated by deep flows and fine sediments, the lower sub-reach is characterized by a steep gradient and rapids. The middle sub-reach is the widest, and is marked by thickly forested islands and boulder berms. The characteristics of the three different sub-reaches suggest control by the interactions of lithology, flood processes and tectonics. Estimations of Hack's (1973) stream-gradient index values indicate considerable variations for the SL values along the length of Narmada River. The highest value of gradient index (SL = 797) is associated with the multi-channel reach, implying lithologic or tectonic control. Given the dimensions of the reach and its channels, it appears that the present hydrological regime is inadequate to produce the feature. We hypothesize that the multi-channel pattern development in bedrock was initiated by block or domal uplift. Enhanced gradients and extreme floods permitted the system to exploit linear weaknesses in the bedrock, leading to the development of anabranches and establishment of multiple channels in bedrock. Abrupt changes in the channel planform and morphology at the study site indicate that the river is adjusting its channel geometry (width, depth, gradient and plan configuration) to a new equilibrium channel morphology through the action of the extreme floods characteristic of this fluvial environment."

A Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act每compliant retrospective review was performed of 121 suspicious, mammographically occult lesions detected on 3.0 T contrast-enhanced breast MRI. All 121 lesions underwent histological sampling. Radiology and clinic reports were reviewed for patient demographics, MRI indication and findings, biopsy and localization details, histological results, and follow-up information. Positive predictive value (PPV) of biopsy recommendations were calculated and compared for screening versus diagnostic cases. Likelihood of malignancy was also compared with lesion size. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square, Fisher's exact, and two-tail z-tests.Overall 43 malignancies were diagnosed from 121 suspicious, mammographically occult 3.0 T MRI-detected lesions. Seventy-eight (64%) of the 121 were benign. The overall PPV of 3.0 T MRI-detected lesions was 36% (43/121). The PPV for biopsy in the screening setting (22% [10/45]) was statistically significantly less (P = .018) compared to the PPV of a biopsy recommendation in the diagnostic setting (43% [33/76]). There was no correlation between lesion size and the likelihood of detecting malignancy.Our PPV of suspicious, mammographically occult, breast lesions detected at 3.0 T breast MRI is similar to the PPV reported previously for suspicious breast lesions detected at 1.5 T. This study supports the use of 3.0 T breast MRI for both screening and diagnostic breast imaging."

Lee, Mary Scott Soo, ","Academic Radiology, Volume 20, Issue 5, May 2013, Pages 569-575, ","To determine the cancelation rate of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided procedures in suspicious breast lesions initially detected at 3.0 Tesla (T) MRI.With institutional review board approval, a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act每compliant retrospective review of 117 suspicious 3.0 T MRI-detected lesions in 101 patients scheduled to undergo MRI-guided procedures was performed; informed consent was waived. Patient information, imaging features, and outcome data were collected and compared among completed and canceled procedures using Fisher's exact test.MRI-guided breast biopsies were canceled in 13% (15/117) because of lesion nonvisualization, including three (20%) masses, one (1%) focus, and 11 (73%) areas of nonmasslike enhancement. Median lesion size was 1.1 cm. Sixty percent (9/15) of nonvisualized lesions were associated with minimal or mild background parenchymal enhancement at MRI. The nonvisualization rate was not associated with patient age, menopausal status, lesion type, size, breast density, or background parenchymal enhancement (P > .7 for each). No cancers were detected at original lesion sites in 14 (93%) patients undergoing follow-up imaging (n = 11) or mastectomy (n = 3) for cancer elsewhere; one (7%) was lost to follow-up.The MRI-guided breast biopsy cancelation rate from nonvisualization of suspicious lesions originally detected with 3.0 T MRI scanning was 13%, similar to rates reported for lesions detected at 1.0 and 1.5 T MRI. No cancers were detected on follow-up imaging. Canceling MRI-guided biopsies because of lesion nonvisualization is a reasonable approach if measures are taken to ensure lesion resolution at the time of biopsy and at imaging follow-up."
Self-Passivating hybrid (organic/inorganic) tandem solar cell,"Sung Jin Kim, Won Jin Kim, Alexander N. Cartwright, Paras N. Prasad, ","Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, Volume 93, Issue 5, May 2009, Pages 657-661, ","A tandem photovoltaic device structure, consisting of a PbSe nanocrystal film and a P3HT/PCBM bulk heterojunction film, was fabricated. The PbSe film (top layer) serves as a photocurrent generator as well as a UV protector for the underlying polymer cell. The P3HT/PCBM photovoltaic cell (bottom layer) provides the necessary electric field to the top photoconducting layer to extract the photogenerated charge from that layer. The charge extraction from the PbSe layer is demonstrated by using light-biased spectral response measurements. In addition, device lifetime measurements were performed under AM 1.5 and UV-enhanced illumination on the tandem cell and on a control P3HT/PCBM device. These measurements demonstrated that the hybrid tandem cell is significantly more durable due to the preferential UV absorption in the upper inorganic PbSe nanocrystal film."
Comparisons of the dynamical characteristics of a semi-submersible floating offshore wind turbine based on two different blade concepts,"Jiahao Chen, Zhiqiang Hu, Decheng Wan, Qing Xiao, ","Ocean Engineering, Volume 153, 1 April 2018, Pages 305-318, ","Scaled model tests are important for the development and validation of floating offshore wind turbines. However, it has been found that Reynolds number dissimilitude between scales deteriorates the aerodynamic performance of floating offshore wind turbines when using model test investigation methodologies. To overcome this challenge, a semi-submersible floating offshore wind turbine model test with two different solutions, namely a geometrically matched blade model and a performance-matched blade model, was conducted in a wind/wave basin. Subsequently, a series of comparisons of the dynamical characteristics of these two models were made to clarify the respective validity of the two models and provide references for future floating offshore wind turbine model optimization. It is found that both model methods are capable of reflecting the essential dynamical characteristics but there are some differences in system eigenfrequencies and response amplitudes. Compared with the geometrically matched blade model, the performance-matched blade model has enhanced aerodynamic performance. Nevertheless, the overweight blades within the performance-matched blade model yields inevitable discrepancies compared with the original design."
Filterless optical oxygen sensor based on a CMOS buried double junction photodiode,"Zhiyong Zhan, Bin Zhou, Zhenhong Fu, Frank V. Bright, Albert H. Titus, ","Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, Volume 176, January 2013, Pages 729-735, ","We present a custom CMOS IC with a buried double junction (BDJ) photodiode to detect and process the optical signal, eliminating the need for any off-chip optical filters. The on-chip signal processing circuitry improves the desired signal extraction from the optical background noise. Since the IC is manufactured using standard commercial fabrication processes with no post-processing necessary, the system can ultimately be low cost to fabricate. Additionally, because of the CMOS integration, it will consume little power when operating, and even less during stand-by."
Antiresonant guiding optofluidic biosensor,"Edward P. Furlani, Roshni Biswas, Alexander N. Cartwright, Natalia M. Litchinitser, ","Optics Communications, Volume 284, Issues 16每17, 1 August 2011, Pages 4094-4098, ",We propose a novel optofluidic biosensor in which detection is based on a shift in the transmission spectrum due to the contrast in refractive index between the carrier fluid and the target biomaterial. The sensor can function using focused illumination without the need for fiber or waveguide coupled input/output signals. We study the spectral response of the sensor using 2D full-wave time-harmonic field analysis and perform parametric analysis of detection sensitivity as a function of material and device parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that detectible shifts in the transmission spectrum can be achieved with nanoscale accumulation of biomaterial within the sensor. We show that the transmission minima and detection sensitivity can be estimated using analytical expressions based on a 1D antiresonant waveguide model.
A refined global-local approach for evaluation of singular stress field based on scaled boundary finite element method,"Lin Pang, Gao Lin, Zhiqiang Hu, ","Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica, Volume 30, Issue 2, April 2017, Pages 123-136, ","A refined global-local approach based on the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is proposed to improve the accuracy of predicted singular stress field. The proposed approach is carried out in conjunction with two steps. First, the entire structure is analyzed by employing an arbitrary numerical method. Then, the interested region, which contains stress singularity, is re-solved using the SBFEM by placing the scaling center right at the singular stress point with the boundary conditions evaluated from the first step imposed along the whole boundary including the side-faces. Benefiting from the semi-analytical nature of the SBFEM, the singular stress field can be predicted accurately without highly refined meshes. It provides the FEM or other numerical methods with a rather simple and convenient way to improve the accuracy of stress analysis. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in dealing with various kinds of problems."
Fingerprint enhancement using STFT analysis,"Sharat Chikkerur, Alexander N. Cartwright, Venu Govindaraju, ","Pattern Recognition, Volume 40, Issue 1, January 2007, Pages 198-211, ","Contrary to popular belief, despite decades of research in fingerprints, reliable fingerprint recognition is still an open problem. Extracting features out of poor quality prints is the most challenging problem faced in this area. This paper introduces a new approach for fingerprint enhancement based on short time Fourier transform (STFT) Analysis. STFT is a well-known technique in signal processing to analyze non-stationary signals. Here we extend its application to 2D fingerprint images. The algorithm simultaneously estimates all the intrinsic properties of the fingerprints such as the foreground region mask, local ridge orientation and local ridge frequency. Furthermore we propose a probabilistic approach of robustly estimating these parameters. We experimentally compare the proposed approach to other filtering approaches in literature and show that our technique performs favorably."

Solution aggregation of anti-trypanosomal N-(2-naphthylmethyl)ated polyamines,"Siddharth Pandey, Kristin A Fletcher, Sheila N Baker, Gary A Baker, Mary C O＊Sullivan, ","Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry, Volume 162, Issues 2每3, 15 March 2004, Pages 387-398, ","Trypanosomatidae parasites are responsible for many human and animal diseases including African sleeping sickness, Chagas＊ disease, and Nagana cattle disease. Since current treatment of trypanosome infections is difficult and often ineffective in controlling the chronic phases of these diseases, more effective anti-trypanosomal drugs are urgently needed. One class of polyamines containing hydrophobic side chains shows promise. However, conformational information regarding their interaction with the target enzyme trypanothione reductase has yet to be obtained. As prelude to such studies, we have made preliminary studies of novel spermine and spermidine analogs bearing one or two N-substituted 2-naphthylmethyl groups dissolved in aqueous solution. Our studies suggest the pH-dependent formation of fluorescent aggregates involving either the encounter of two excited-state naphthyl groups (※excimer§) or formation of an excited-state complex (※exciplex§) formed as a consequence of amine-to-naphthyl electron transfer. These spectral changes may be used to explore the mechanism by which N-(2-naphthylmethyl) polyamine analogs exert their toxic effects toward the design of improved candidates for anti-trypanosomal chemotherapy."
Experimental investigation on dynamic responses of FLNG connection system during side-by-side offloading operation,"Dongya Zhao, Zhiqiang Hu, Gang Chen, ","Ocean Engineering, Volume 136, 15 May 2017, Pages 283-293, ","This paper presents an experimental investigation on dynamic responses of the connection system in the FLNG (Floating Liquefied Natural Gas) system during side-by-side offloading operations. A typical side-by-side connection system for an FLNG and LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) carrier that includes 16 hawsers and 6 fenders is adopted. Three typical irregular wave cases are used in the model test. Relationships between relative vessel motion and the load born by the connection system are obtained, and features of dynamic connection system responses are summarized based on the analysis results. The results show that hawsers and fenders at different locations are sensitive to different motion patterns; loads on connection systems have distinct dynamic properties, and snap loading crucial to the safety of offloading processes can be induced. Moreover, for partially filled conditions, sloshing effects on vessel motion and on the connection system are examined. FLNG and LNGC are subjected to large low frequency responses in side-by-side configurations due to hydrodynamic interactions and sloshing effects. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses of the connection system relative to wave amplitudes and directions are conducted. According to our sensitivity studies, high wave amplitudes can excite pronounced relative motions and large loads on the connection system; heading and oblique waves significantly affect spring hawsers in mid-ship areas and breast hawsers in bow and stern areas; and positive sheltering effects can be obtained when FLNG occupies the weather side."
Coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic methods for floating wind turbines,"Jiahao Chen, Zhiqiang Hu, Geliang Liu, Decheng Wan, ","Renewable Energy, Volume 130, January 2019, Pages 139-153, ","To meet the demand of the development of floating wind turbines, coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic methods were developed and then were programmed as an integrated code DARwind (short for Dynamic Analysis for Response of Wind Turbines) for simulating floating wind turbines. This paper first presents the theoretical background, including Kane's dynamical equations in combination with the Cardan angles method, the hybrid coordinate dynamic analysis method, and the adjacent array approach for kinematics and kinetics. The blade element/momentum method with aerodynamic corrections was used for aerodynamic simulation. Potential-flow theory, the second-order wave forces and the Morison formula with the strip theory were used for hydrodynamics, and a quasi-static mooring modelling approach was developed for the catenary mooring system. A generator-torque controller and a full-span rotor-collective blade-pitch controller were adopted for control strategies. The code was then verified by a series of code-to-experiment comparisons, including the mooring system, the structural elasticity, the aerodynamic performance, the hydrodynamic performance and the control strategy. The comparisons demonstrated that the coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic methods have a satisfactory ability to perform fully coupled simulations for floating wind turbines."
Bottom structural response prediction for ship-powered grounding over rock-type seabed obstructions,"Bin Sun, Zhiqiang Hu, Jin Wang, ","Marine Structures, Volume 54, July 2017, Pages 127-143, ","This paper presents a simplified analytical method for predicting the resistance of ship bottom structures when a ship runs aground over rock-type seabed obstructions. During the powered grounding scenario, the structural damage caused by sharp seabed obstructions may lead to earlier penetration and serious consequences, such as compartment flooding, oil leakage and environmental pollution. Therefore, it is of great importance to rapidly and accurately analyse the response of a ship's bottom structure during powered grounding scenarios. A new simplified kinematically admissible analytical model is built to capture the dominant failure modes of the bottom transverse floor, which include plastic bending and membrane stretching, and the analytical expression of the resistance of the bottom floor is derived from a plastic mechanism analysis. The failure mechanisms of the bottom plating are also analyzed to provide insight into the main deformation mechanisms with reasonable predictive accuracy. The analytical prediction method is verified by numerical simulation using the code LS-DYNA. The simulation cases cover a wide range of indentations and semi-apex angles of the cone-shaped rocks. The results agree well, proving that the proposed analytical method can be used to predict the ship bottom structure crashworthiness during the structural design phase."
Incorporation of antibacterial agent derived deep eutectic solvent into an active dental composite,"Jing Wang, Xiaoqing Dong, Qingsong Yu, Sheila N. Baker, Meng Chen, ","Dental Materials, Volume 33, Issue 12, December 2017, Pages 1445-1455, ","To incorporate an antibacterial agent derived deep eutectic solvent (DES) into a dental resin composite, and investigate the resulting mechanical properties and antibacterial effects.The DES was derived from benzalkonium chloride (BC) and acrylic acid (AA) and was incorporated into the dental resin composite through rapid mixing. A three-point bending test was employed to measure the flexural strength of the composite. An agar diffusion test was used to investigate antibacterial activity. Artificial (accelerated) aging was undertaken by immersing the composites in buffer solutions at an elevated temperature for up to 4 weeks. UV每vis spectrophotometry and NMR analysis were conducted to study BC release from the composite. Finally, the biocompatibility of the composite materials was evaluated using osteoblast cell culture for 7 days. Results were compared to those of a control composite which contained no BC.The DES-incorporated composite (DES-C) displayed higher flexural strength than a similar BC-incorporated composite BC (BC-C) for the same level of BC. The inclusion of BC conferred antibacterial activity to both BC-containing composites, although BC-C produced larger inhibition halos than DES-C at the same loading of BC. Control composites which contained no BC showed negligible antibacterial activity. After artificial aging, the DES-C composite showed better maintenance of the mechanical properties of the control compared with BC-C, although a decrease was observed during the three-point bending test, particularly upon storage at elevated temperatures. No BC release was detected in the aged solutions of DES-C, whereas the BC-C showed a linear increase in BC release with storage time. Significantly, cell viability results indicated that DES-C has better biocompatibility than BC-C.The incorporation of a BC-based DES into a dental resin composite provides a new strategy to develop antibacterial dental materials with better biocompatibility and longer effective lifetimes without sacrificing the intrinsic mechanical properties of the composite structure.Download high-res image (106KB)Download full-size image"
Hydrodynamic characteristic of synthetic jet steered underwater vehicle,"Lingbo Geng, Zhiqiang Hu, Yang Lin, ","Applied Ocean Research, Volume 70, January 2018, Pages 1-13, ","In this paper, the hydrodynamic characteristic of a synthetic jet steered underwater vehicle is studied. The steering motion studied is the lateral motion and the yaw motion.

The vehicle studied is REMUS AUV with synthetic jet actuator mounted inside. The hydrodynamic characteristic of the vehicle under different cruising speed is studied. The driving parameters of the SJ actuator keep invariant in different cases. When the two actuators work in phase, the average steering force is smaller than the thrust of the isolated actuator and keeps nearly invariant under different cruising speed. When the two actuators work out of phase, the average steering moment also keeps invariant with cruising speed. The mathematical model of the additional drag of the vehicle, the thrust of the actuator, the steering force as well as the steering moment is given.

Numerical investigation of the influence of nozzle geometrical parameters on thrust of synthetic jet underwater,"Lingbo Geng, Zhiqiang Hu, Yang Lin, ","Sensors and Actuators A: Physical, Volume 269, 1 January 2018, Pages 111-125, ","The thrust characteristic and efficiency of synthetic jet underwater is easily affected by the geometrical parameters. In this paper, the influence of nozzle geometrical parameters on the thrust of synthetic jet underwater is investigated through numerical method. The geometrical parameters studied include nozzle diameter and nozzle height. The numerical method is validated using the experiment data. A mathematical model of the thrust is established. This model decomposes the thrust into three parts. By adjusting the weights of these parts, the dynamic characteristic of the thrust can be rebuilt. Using this method, the mechanism behind the thrust variation with nozzle geometrical parameters is analyzed. The variation of the thrust with the nozzle diameter is induced by the increase of the acceleration force and the decrease of the pressure force. When the nozzle diameter is small, the thrust is velocity dominated. While when diameter is large, the thrust is acceleration dominated. The thrust variation with nozzle height has two different patterns. The pressure force dominates the first pattern of thrust variation. And the acceleration force contributes more to the second pattern of thrust variation. The results in this paper can be used for the efficiency oriented optimal design of synthetic jet actuator underwater."
Analysis of 14-3-3 isoforms expressed in photoreceptors,"Shivangi M. Inamdar, Colten K. Lankford, Joseph G. Laird, Gulnara Novbatova, Sheila A. Baker, ","Experimental Eye Research, Volume 170, May 2018, Pages 108-116, ","The 14-3-3 family of proteins has undergone considerable expansion in higher eukaryotes with humans and mice expressing seven isoforms (汕, 汍, 灰, 污, 牟, 汎, and 考) from seven distinct genes (YWHAB, YWAHE, YWHAH, YWHAG, YWHAQ, YWHAZ, and SFN). Growing evidence indicates that while highly conserved, these isoforms are not entirely functionally redundant as they exhibit unique tissue expression profiles, subcellular localization, and biochemical functions. A key limitation in our understanding of 14-3-3 biology lies in our limited knowledge of cell-type specific 14-3-3 expression. Here we provide a characterization of 14-3-3 expression in whole retina and isolated rod photoreceptors using reverse-transcriptase digital droplet PCR. We find that all 14-3-3 genes with the exception of SFN are expressed in mouse retina with YWHAQ and YWHAE being the most highly expressed. Rod photoreceptors are enriched in YWHAE (14-3-3 汍). Immunohistochemistry revealed that 14-3-3 汍 and 14-3-3 汎 exhibit unique distributions in photoreceptors with 14-3-3 汍 restricted to the inner segment and 14-3-3 汎 localized to the outer segment. Our data demonstrates that, in the retina, 14-3-3 isoforms likely serve specific functions as they exhibit unique expression levels and cell-type specificity. As such, future investigations into 14-3-3 function in rod photoreceptors should be centered on 14-3-3 汍 and 14-3-3 汎, depending on the subcellular region of question.Download high-res image (177KB)Download full-size image"
A nonlinear analysis of dynamic interactions of CFRD每compressible reservoir system based on FEM每SBFEM,"He Xu, Degao Zou, Xianjing Kong, Zhiqiang Hu, Xiaohui Su, ","Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, Volume 112, September 2018, Pages 24-34, ","Reservoir water compressibility is a major factor affecting dynamic dam每reservoir interactions, and most studies focus on the analysis of concrete dams. However, few studies have been conducted with respect to the effects of reservoir water compressibility on the dynamic response of CFRDs (concrete-faced rockfill dams). Furthermore, new researches show the hydrodynamic pressure is significant for evaluating the seismic performance of high CFRD. In this paper, a method to calculate the nonlinear dynamic interactions of CFRD每compressible reservoir water system in the time-domain is established based on a FEM每SBFEM approach. The CFRD is discretized using the finite element method (FEM), and the hydrodynamic pressure of the semi-infinite water on the upstream face of the dam is calculated using the efficient scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM), in which the degrees of freedom of the hydrodynamic pressure to be solved for are relatively few. The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of reservoir water compressibility and the sediment absorption layer at the reservoir bottom and bank slopes on the dynamic response of a high CFRD每reservoir-coupled system under seismic action in various directions. When the reservoir water is considered compressible, partial absorption of the hydrodynamic pressure wave by the sediments can be considered. The results show that water compressibility can significantly affect the stress in the face slabs."

They provide critical data during scenarios ranging from e.g., disaster response to in-home healthcare. However, for these devices to work effectively, end-to-end security schemes for the device communication protocols have to be flexible and should depend upon the application requirements as well as the resource constraints at the network-edge. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a flexible IoT security middleware for end-to-end cloud每fog communications involving smart devices and cloud-hosted applications. The novel features of our middleware are in its ability to cope with intermittent network connectivity as well as device constraints in terms of computational power, memory, energy, and network bandwidth. To provide security during intermittent network conditions, we use a ＆Session Resumption＊ algorithm in order for our middleware to reuse encrypted sessions from the recent past, if a recently disconnected device wants to resume a prior connection that was interrupted. In addition, we describe an ＆Optimal Scheme Decider＊ algorithm that enables our middleware to select the best possible end-to-end security scheme option that matches with a given set of device constraints. Experiment results show how our middleware implementation also provides fast and resource-aware security by leveraging static properties i.e., static pre-shared keys (PSKs) for a variety of IoT-based application requirements that have trade-offs in higher security or faster data transfer rates."
Experimental and numerical investigation of the responses of scaled tanker side double-hull structures laterally punched by conical and knife edge indenters,"Min Zhang, Jingxi Liu, Zhiqiang Hu, Yao Zhao, ","Marine Structures, Volume 61, September 2018, Pages 62-84, ","This paper addresses experimental and finite-element simulation studies on scaled double-hull side structures quasi-statically punched at the mid-span by conical and knife edge indenters to examine their fracture behaviors and energy dissipation mechanisms. The specimen, scaled from a tanker double side, accounts for one span of the stringers in length and two spans of the web frames in width. The experimental results show that a double hull punched by a conical indenter shows much stronger resistance than that of a double hull punched by a knife edge indenter in severe collisions due to a difference in the fracture mode, while the double hull performs better in minor collisions punched by the knife edge indenter due to the deformation mode. In addition, numerical simulations are also carried out for the corresponding scenarios by the explicit LS-DYNA finite element solver. A relatively fine mesh in the contact area is used to capture the fracture initiation and propagation of the two specimens. The resistance-penetration curves and the deformations are compared with those observed in experiments, and these results match well. The numerical analysis discusses some aspects of particular relevance to the response of ship structures suffering accidental loads, including the importance of specifying the modeled welds, the influences of failure criteria, material relations on simulating complex structures, and application of scaling laws in assessing the impact response of full-scale structure."
AGRA: AI-augmented geographic routing approach for IoT-based incident-supporting applications,"Dmitrii Chemodanov, Flavio Esposito, Andrei Sukhov, Prasad Calyam, Zakariya Oraibi, ","Future Generation Computer Systems, In press, corrected proof, Available online 25 August 2017, ","Applications that cater to the needs of disaster incident response generate large amount of data and demand large computational resource access. Such datasets are usually collected in real-time at the incident scenes using different Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Hierarchical clouds, i.e., core and edge clouds, can help these applications＊ real-time data orchestration challenges as well as with their IoT operations scalability, reliability and stability by overcoming infrastructure limitations at the ad-hoc wireless network edge. Routing is a crucial infrastructure management orchestration mechanism for such systems. Current geographic routing or greedy forwarding approaches designed for early wireless ad-hoc networks lack efficient solutions for disaster incident-supporting applications, given the high-speed and low-latency data delivery that edge cloud gateways impose. In this paper, we present a novel Artificial Intelligent (AI)-augmented geographic routing approach, that relies on an area knowledge obtained from the satellite imagery (available at the edge cloud) by applying deep learning. In particular, we propose a stateless greedy forwarding that uses such an environment learning to proactively avoid the local minimum problem by diverting traffic with an algorithm that emulates electrostatic repulsive forces. In our theoretical analysis, we show that our Greedy Forwarding achieves in the worst case a 3.291 path stretch approximation bound with respect to the shortest path, without assuming presence of symmetrical links or unit disk graphs. We evaluate our approach with both numerical and event-driven simulations, and we establish the practicality of our approach in a real incident-supporting hierarchical cloud deployment to demonstrate improvement of application level throughput due to a reduced path stretch under severe node failures and high mobility challenges of disaster response scenarios."
Chapter Seven: Photoreceptor Inner and Outer Segments,"Sheila A.

The synapse is the compartment where changes in membrane potentials are relayed to other neurons in the retina via release of neurotransmitter. The composition of the plasma membrane surrounding these compartments varies to accommodate their specific functions. In this chapter, we discuss the organization of the plasma membrane emphasizing the protein composition of each region as it relates to visual signaling.

Nonlinear sloshing in rectangular tanks under forced excitation,"Dongya Zhao, Zhiqiang Hu, Gang Chen, Serena Lim, Shuqi Wang, ","International Journal of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Volume 10, Issue 5, September 2018, Pages 545-565, ","A numerical code is developed based on potential flow theory to investigate nonlinear sloshing in rectangular Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) tanks under forced excitation. Using this code, internal free-surface elevation and sloshing loads on liquid tanks can be obtained both in time domain and frequency domain. In the mathematical model, acceleration potential is solved in the calculation of pressure on tanks and the artificial damping model is adopted to account for energy dissipation during sloshing. The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is used to solve boundary value problems of both velocity potential and acceleration potential. Numerical calculation results are compared with published results to determine the efficiency and accuracy of the numerical code. Sloshing properties in partially filled rectangular and membrane tank under translational and rotational excitations are investigated. It is found that sloshing under horizontal and rotational excitations share similar properties. The first resonant mode and excitation frequency are the dominant response frequencies. Resonant sloshing will be excited when vertical excitation lies in the instability region. For liquid tank under rotational excitation, sloshing responses including amplitude and phase are sensitive to the location of the center of rotation. Moreover, experimental tests were conducted to analyze viscous effects on sloshing and to validate the feasibility of artificial damping models. The results show that the artificial damping model with modifying wall boundary conditions has better applicability in simulating sloshing under different fill levels and excitations."

The VIM of deep-draft semi-submersible is more complex than single column floaters because of the wake interference between columns, as well as the considerable yaw motions. In the present work, a numerical approach for simulating VIM of deep-draft semi-submersible is proposed. Specifically, detached-eddy simulation is used for turbulence modeling and dynamic overset grid technique is used for moving objects. Simulations for stationary drag and VIM of a model-scale paired-column semi-submersible are conducted with the proposed approach. The numerical results are compared with experimental data. Transverse, in-line and yaw motions are allowed during VIM simulations and are further analyzed in frequency domain by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Different VIM characteristics are observed at different current velocities. The work done by each component of the structure is also discussed. Flow visualizations are presented for better understanding of the wake interferences during VIM. The accuracy and reliability of the current numerical approach is assessed."

The paper introduces procedures for developing the resistance factors and demonstrates the usefulness of the calibrated resistance factors. Simulations were performed to mimic designs using different quantities of measurements from ※state of the art§ site investigations at rock and soil sites with high and low site variability, respectively. The results show that the percentage of designs achieving the target reliability steadily increases with more measurements. The percentage of under reliable cases is practically independent of the number of measurements and the design models used. The percentage of designs achieving the target reliability is greater for the rock site when adopting the calibrated resistance factors. Generally, the percentage of designs achieving target reliability heavily depends on the quantity of measurements acquired from site characterization and the site variability."

Surgeons and patients were not blinded but the data analyst, while doing the analyses, remained blinded to treatment groups. The primary outcome was hip reoperation within 24 months after initial surgery to promote fracture healing, relieve pain, treat infection, or improve function. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00761813.Between March 3, 2008, and March 31, 2014, we randomly assigned 1108 patients to receive a sliding hip screw (n=557) or cancellous screws (n=551). Reoperations within 24 months did not differ by type of surgical fixation in those included in the primary analysis: 107 (20%) of 542 patients in the sliding hip screw group versus 117 (22%) of 537 patients in the cancellous screws group (hazard ratio [HR] 0﹞83, 95% CI 0﹞63每1﹞09; p=0﹞18). Avascular necrosis was more common in the sliding hip screw group than in the cancellous screws group (50 patients [9%] vs 28 patients [5%]; HR 1﹞91, 1﹞06每3﹞44; p=0﹞0319). However, no significant difference was found between the number of medically related adverse events between groups (p=0﹞82; appendix); these events included pulmonary embolism (two patients [<1%] vs four [1%] patients; p=0﹞41) and sepsis (seven [1%] vs six [1%]; p=0﹞79).In terms of reoperation rates the sliding hip screw shows no advantage, but some groups of patients (smokers and those with displaced or base of neck fractures) might do better with a sliding hip screw than with cancellous screws.National Institutes of Health, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Stichting NutsOhra, Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development, Physicians' Services Incorporated."

The IDP2017 includes data from the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic, Southern and Indian oceans, with about twice the data volume of the previous IDP2014. For the first time, the IDP2017 contains data for a large suite of biogeochemical parameters as well as aerosol and rain data characterising atmospheric trace element and isotope (TEI) sources. The TEI data in the IDP2017 are quality controlled by careful assessment of intercalibration results and multi-laboratory data comparisons at crossover stations. The IDP2017 consists of two parts: (1) a compilation of digital data for more than 450 TEIs as well as standard hydrographic parameters, and (2) the eGEOTRACES Electronic Atlas providing an on-line atlas that includes more than 590 section plots and 130 animated 3D scenes. The digital data are provided in several formats, including ASCII, Excel spreadsheet, netCDF, and Ocean Data View collection. Users can download the full data packages or make their own custom selections with a new on-line data extraction service. In addition to the actual data values, the IDP2017 also contains data quality flags and 1-考 data error values where available. Quality flags and error values are useful for data filtering and for statistical analysis. Metadata about data originators, analytical methods and original publications related to the data are linked in an easily accessible way. The eGEOTRACES Electronic Atlas is the visual representation of the IDP2017 as section plots and rotating 3D scenes. The basin-wide 3D scenes combine data from many cruises and provide quick overviews of large-scale tracer distributions. These 3D scenes provide geographical and bathymetric context that is crucial for the interpretation and assessment of tracer plumes near ocean margins or along ridges. The IDP2017 is the result of a truly international effort involving 326 researchers from 25 countries. This publication provides the critical reference for unpublished data, as well as for studies that make use of a large cross-section of data from the IDP2017.

Chan, Puneet Kapur, Derek Sifford, METRIQ Study Collaborators, ","Annals of Emergency Medicine, In press, corrected proof, Available online 3 July 2018, ","Online educational resources such as blogs are increasingly used for education by emergency medicine clinicians. The Social Media Index was developed to quantify their relative impact. The Medical Education Translational Resources: Indicators of Quality (METRIQ) study was conducted in part to determine the association between the Social Media Index score and quality as measured by gestalt and previously derived quality instruments.Ten blogs were randomly selected from a list of emergency medicine and critical care Web sites. The 2 most recent clinically oriented blog posts published on these blogs were evaluated with gestalt, the Academic Life in Emergency Medicine Approved Instructional Resources (ALiEM AIR) score, and the METRIQ-8 score. Volunteer raters (including medical students, emergency medicine residents, and emergency medicine attending physicians) were identified with a multimodal recruitment methodology. The Social Media Index was calculated in February 2016, November 2016, April 2017, and December 2017. Pearson＊s correlations were calculated between the Social Media Index and the average rater gestalt, ALiEM AIR score, and METRIQ-8 score.A total of 309 of 330 raters completed all ratings (93.6%). The Social Media Index correlated moderately to strongly with the mean rater gestalt ratings (range 0.69 to 0.76) and moderately with the mean rater ALiEM AIR score (range 0.55 to 0.61) and METRIQ-8 score (range 0.53 to 0.57) during the month of the blog post＊s selection and for 2 years after.The Social Media Index＊s correlation with multiple quality evaluation instruments over time supports the hypothesis that it is associated with overall Web site quality.

The optimization of the geometric cross-section dimensions of raised pedestrian crosswalks: A case study in Qazvin,"Amir H. Mohammadipour, Seyed Hafez Alavi, ","Accident Analysis & Prevention, Volume 41, Issue 2, March 2009, Pages 314-326, ","This study attempts to optimize the geometric cross-section dimensions of raised pedestrian crosswalks (RPC), employing safety and comfort measures which reflect environmental conditions and drivers behavioral patterns in Qazvin, Iran. Geometric characteristics including street width, ramp lengths, top flat crown length and height, and 4672 spot speed observations of 23 implemented RPCs were considered. The authors established geometric and analytical equations to satisfactorily express the discomfort that vehicle occupants experience while traversing an RPC and the crossing risk to pedestrians. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are reputed for their capability to learn and generalize complex engineering phenomena and were therefore adopted to cope with the highly nonlinear relationship between the before-RPC spot speeds, the geometric characteristics, and spot speeds on the RPC. This on-RPC spot speed has been utilized for computing the above-mentioned criteria. Combining these criteria, a new judgment index was created to identify the optimum RPC which fulfills the highest comfort and safety levels. It was observed that the variable with the highest impact is the second ramp length, followed by the first ramp length, top flat crown length, before-RPC spot speed, height, and street width, in order of magnitude."

Old health risks in new places? An ecological niche model for I. ricinus tick distribution in Europe under a changing climate,"Melanie Boeckmann, T. Andrew Joyner, ","Health & Place, Volume 30, November 2014, Pages 70-77, ","Climate change will likely have impacts on disease vector distribution. Posing a significant health threat in the 21st century, risk of tick-borne diseases may increase with higher annual mean temperatures and changes in precipitation. We modeled the current and future potential distribution of the Ixodes ricinus tick species in Europe. The Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) was utilized to predict potential distributions of I. ricinus based on current (1990每2010 averages) and future (2040每2060 averages) environmental variables. A ten model best subset was created out of a possible 200 models based on omission and commission criteria. Our results show that under the A2 climate change scenario the potential habitat range for the I. ricinus tick in Europe will expand into higher elevations and latitudes (e.g., Scandinavia, the Baltics, and Belarus), while contracting in other areas (e.g., Alps, Pyrenees, interior Italy, and northwestern Poland). Overall, a potential habitat expansion of 3.8% in all of Europe is possible. Our results may be used to inform climate change adaptation efforts in Europe."
A new improved krill herd algorithm for global numerical optimization,"Lihong Guo, Gai-Ge Wang, Amir H. Gandomi, Amir H. Alavi, Hong Duan, ","Neurocomputing, Volume 138, 22 August 2014, Pages 392-402, ","This study presents an improved krill herd (IKH) approach to solve global optimization problems.

This novel meta-heuristic approach can accelerate the global convergence speed while preserving the robustness of the basic KH algorithm. Besides, the detailed implementation procedure for the IKH method is described. Several standard benchmark functions are used to verify the efficiency of IKH. Based on the results, the performance of IKH is superior to or highly competitive with the standard KH and other robust population-based optimization methods."
Damage detection using self-powered wireless sensor data: An evolutionary approach,"Amir H. Alavi, Hassene Hasni, Nizar Lajnef, Karim Chatti, Fred Faridazar, ","Measurement, Volume 82, March 2016, Pages 254-283, ","A major limitation in implementation of self-powered wireless sensors pertains to considerable loss of the sensed information. Consequently, interpretation of the limited but valued data generated by the self-powered wireless sensing technology becomes a challenging problem. To tackle this issue, this study presents an evolutionary computational approach for structural damage detection using the self-powered wireless sensor data. The proposed data interpretation system is based on the integration of a robust evolutionary technique, called gene expression programming (GEP), and finite element (FE) method. Several damage indicator variables are extracted upon the simulation of the compressed data stored in memory chips of self-powered sensors. For the analysis, the complicated case of gusset plate of bridge is considered. Different damage scenarios are introduced to the plate and for each scenario and sensor configuration, a damage detection model is derived. Bases on a logistic regression analysis, probabilities are assigned to each model to find the most probable damage state. The damage detection models are presented as MATLAB and Visual Basic codes for further analysis. An uncertainty analysis is performed through the contamination of the damage indicator features with different noise levels. The results indicate that the proposed method is efficiently capable of detecting different damage states in spite of high-level noise contamination."
Carbamate and pyrethroid resistance in the akron strain of Anopheles gambiae,"James M. Mutunga, Troy D. Anderson, Derek T. Craft, Aaron D. Gross, Jeffrey R. Bloomquist, ","Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology, Volume 121, June 2015, Pages 116-121, ","Insecticide resistance in the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, is a serious problem, epitomized by the multi-resistant Akron strain, originally isolated in the country of Benin. Here we report resistance in this strain to pyrethroids and DDT (13-fold to 35-fold compared to the susceptible G3 strain), but surprisingly little resistance to etofenprox, a compound sometimes described as a ※pseudo-pyrethroid.§ There was also strong resistance to topically-applied commercial carbamates (45-fold to 81-fold), except for the oximes aldicarb and methomyl. Biochemical assays showed enhanced cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and carboxylesterase activity, but not that of glutathione-S-transferase. A series of substituted 汐,汐,汐,-trifluoroacetophenone oxime methylcarbamates were evaluated for enzyme inhibition potency and toxicity against G3 and Akron mosquitoes. The compound bearing an unsubstituted phenyl ring showed the greatest toxicity to mosquitoes of both strains. Low cross resistance in Akron was retained by all analogs in the series. Kinetic analysis of acetylcholinesterase activity and its inhibition by insecticides in the G3 strain showed inactivation rate constants greater than that of propoxur, and against Akron enzyme inactivation rate constants similar to that of aldicarb. However, inactivation rate constants against recombinant human AChE were essentially identical to that of the G3 strain. Thus, the acetophenone oxime carbamates described here, though potent insecticides that control resistant Akron mosquitoes, require further structural modification to attain acceptable selectivity and human safety."
An intelligent structural damage detection approach based on self-powered wireless sensor data,"Amir H. Alavi, Hassene Hasni, Nizar Lajnef, Karim Chatti, Fred Faridazar, ","Automation in Construction, Volume 62, February 2016, Pages 24-44, ","This study presents the results of an ongoing research project conducted by the U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on developing an intelligent approach for structural damage detection. The proposed approach is established upon the simulation of the compressed data stored in memory chips of a newly developed self-powered wireless sensor. An innovative data interpretation system integrating finite element method (FEM) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) based on Bayesian decision theory is developed for damage detection. Several features extracted from the cumulative limited static strain data are used as damage indicator variables. Another contribution of this paper is to define indicator variables that simultaneously take into account the effect of array of sensors. The performance of the proposed approach is first evaluated for the case of a simply supported beam under three-point bending. Then, the efficiency of the method is tested for the complicated case of a bridge gusset plate. The beam and gusset plate structures are analyzed as 3D FE models. The static strain data from the FE simulations for different damage scenarios is used to calibrate the sensor-specific data interpretation algorithm. The viability and repeatability of the method is demonstrated by conducting a number of simulations. Furthermore, a general scheme is presented for finding the optimal number of data acquisition points (sensors) on the structure and the associated optimal locations. An uncertainty analysis is performed through the contamination of the damage indicator features with different Gaussian noise levels."
Direct and vicarious conspicuous consumption: Identification with low-status groups increases the desire for high-status goods,"Philip J. Mazzocco, Derek D. Rucker, Adam D. Galinsky, Eric T. Anderson, ","Journal of Consumer Psychology, Volume 22, Issue 4, October 2012, Pages 520-528, ","The current research examines whether direct and vicarious identification with a low-status group affects consumers' desire for objects associated with status. Experiment 1 found that individuals who belonged to and identified with a status social category associated with relatively lower status (Blacks) exhibited an enhanced desire for high-status products compared to Blacks who did not identify with their race or individuals who belonged to a social category associated with higher status (Whites). In Experiments 2 and 3, White participants led to vicariously identify through perspective taking with Blacks (Experiment 2), or a low-status occupational group (Experiment 3) exhibited an increased desire for high-status products. Experiment 4 provided meditational evidence for a status based explanation for the relationship between identification with a low-status group and a desire for high-status products. The present work makes new inroads into understanding one factor that might lead minorities to engage in greater conspicuous consumption and provides evidence that conspicuous consumption can be elicited vicariously."
Fatigue cracking detection in steel bridge girders through a self-powered sensing concept,"Amir H. Alavi, Hassene Hasni, Pengcheng Jiao, Wassim Borchani, Nizar Lajnef, ","Journal of Constructional Steel Research, Volume 128, January 2017, Pages 19-38, ","Development of fatigue cracking is affecting the structural performance of many of welded steel bridges in the United States. One of the main sources of fatigue cracking is out-of-plane distortion occurring at connections of transverse structural members and longitudinal girders. Distortion-induced fatigue cracks mostly occur in older bridges with members prone to fatigue. Prediction of secondary stresses in these members is difficult using conventional design specifications. This limitation suggests the necessity of utilizing new strategies to analyze the damage caused by distortion-related cracking. This study presents a new approach for detection of distortion-induced fatigue cracking of steel bridges based on the interpretation of the data provided by a newly developed self-powered piezo-floating-gate (PFG) sensor. The PFG sensors are empowered using piezoelectric transducers through harvesting energy from the mechanical loading experienced by the structure. In order to assess the performance of the proposed sensing system, three-dimensional finite element models were developed and the structural response of the girder was subsequently obtained. The fatigue life of the girder was determined based on J-integral concept and Paris Law. Several damage states were defined by extending the fatigue crack lengths. Thereafter, features representing the PFG sensor output were extracted from the strain data for different sensing nodes to detect the damage scenarios. Furthermore, a new data fusion concept based on the effect of group of sensors was proposed to improve the damage detection performance. The results indicate that the proposed method is capable of detecting different damage progression states. This is specifically evident for the sensors that are located close to the damage location. The acceptable performance of the proposed sensing system implies its applicability for other modalities of infrastructure/structural health monitoring (I/SHM)."
Chapter 7 Microbial redox interactions with uranium: an environmental perspective,"Anderson Robert T., Derek R. Lovley, ","Radioactivity in the Environment, Volume 2, 2002, Pages 205-223, ","This chapter discusses microbial interactions with U, particularly emphasizing the biogeochemical aspects and implications of U reduction. Microbially catalyzed processes have the potential to affect the fate of U profoundly in a variety of environmental settings. Redox interactions are particularly important because the mobility of U in the environment is largely determined by its oxidation state. Reduced U, U(IV), is highly insoluble and is the oxidation state most often associated with U-containing ores. Metal每microbe redox interactions have implications for ore formation and recovery of metals from ore-containing materials. Aerobic, metal-oxidizing bacteria catalyze the oxidation of reduced metals, enhancing metal recovery from ore-containing materials during bioleaching processes. Anaerobic bacteria found in sedimentary environments catalyze metal reduction. The chapter also discusses engineered removal of U from groundwater and waste streams by microbial reduction. Understanding the microbial ecology of anaerobic aquifers can aid the stimulation and control of an in situ process for U immobilization. However, uranium reduction in situ has yet to be attempted at a U-contaminated site."
Post-buckling response of non-uniform cross-section bilaterally constrained beams,"Pengcheng Jiao, Wassim Borchani, Hassene Hasni, Amir. H. Alavi, Nizar Lajnef, ","Mechanics Research Communications, Volume 78, Part A, December 2016, Pages 42-50, ","Buckling and post-buckling behaviors of structural elements have been widely used to create multi-stable mechanisms that have shown a great efficiency in many applications such as sensing, actuation and energy harvesting. Under an increasing axial loading, the strain energy stored in a buckled bilaterally constrained elastica is suddenly released, through a snap-through transition. These transitions can be used to convert low-rate and low-frequency excitations into high-rate motions that are converted into electrical signals using piezoelectric transducers. However, for efficient sensing and energy harvesting, these transitions have to be controlled. It has been shown that the spacing between the transitions cannot be controlled just by tuning the geometry properties of a uniform cross-section beam. This paper investigates the effect of different non-uniform cross-sections on the post-buckling response of a bilaterally constrained beam. An energy-based model that takes into account the shape variation is herein presented. The variation of the beam＊s cross-section area can either be continuous or piecewise continuous. The total potential energy of the system is minimized under constraints that represent the physical confinement of the beam between the lateral boundaries. Results demonstrate that the spacing ratio between buckling-mode transitions can be efficiently controlled by the beam＊s shape and geometry dimensions."

Fuzzy Choquet integration of homogeneous possibility and probability distributions,"Derek T. Anderson, Paul Elmore, Fred Petry, Timothy C. Havens, ","Information Sciences, Volume 363, 1 October 2016, Pages 24-39, ","The fuzzy integral (FI) is an extremely flexible and powerful tool for data and information aggregation. The FI is parametrized by the fuzzy measure (FM), a normal and monotone capacity. Based on the selection of FM, the FI produces different aggregation operators. In recent years, a number of FI extensions have been put forth relative to different types of uncertain information, e.g., real-, interval- and set-valued (under various constraints). Herein, we study the applicability and behavior of different extensions of the fuzzy Choquet integral for fusing homogeneous possibility and probability distributions. This analysis is of great utility in terms of understanding what extensions and under what conditions it is possible to aggregate and maintain homogeneity within uncertain information. We show that two extensions, gFI and NDFI, can aggregate both probability and possibility distributions. While these extensions do not always maintain homogeneity, they do under certain conditions. Last, while we specifically focus on the aggregation of homogeneous uncertain information, the propositions put forth also shed light into heterogeneous information aggregation via the gFI and the NDFI."

The proposed approach utilizes opposition-based learning (OBL), position clamping (PC) and Cauchy mutation (CM) to enhance the performance of basic KH. OBL accelerates the convergence of the method while both PC and heavy-tailed CM help KH escape from local optima. Simulations are implemented on an array of benchmark functions and two engineering optimization problems. The results show that OKH has a good performance on majority of the considered functions and two engineering cases. The influence of each individual strategy (OBL, CM and PC) on KH is verified through 25 benchmarks. The results show that the KH with OBL, CM and PC operators, has the best performance among different variants of OKH."

Circular Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) piezoelectric transducers and bimorph PZT cantilever plates are used as strain and acceleration sensors, respectively. The strain and acceleration time histories are obtained from the finite element (FE) model. A theoretical model is used to obtain the voltage output delivered by the PZTs. Initial damage indicator features are defined by fitting a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to the sensors output histograms. Moreover, a new sensor fusion model is proposed to improve the accuracy of the damage detection approach.

The introduced SSC operator is originated from original Stud genetic algorithm. In SSC operator, the best krill, the Stud, provides its optimal information for all the other individuals in the population using general genetic operators instead of stochastic selection. This approach appears to be well capable of solving various functions. Several problems are used to test the SKH method. In addition, the influence of the different crossover types on convergence and performance is carefully studied. Experimental results indicate an instructive addition to the portfolio of swarm intelligence techniques."
Damage growth detection in steel plates: Numerical and experimental studies,"Amir H. Alavi, Hassene Hasni, Nizar Lajnef, Karim Chatti, ","Engineering Structures, Volume 128, 1 December 2016, Pages 124-138, ","This paper presents a new method for crack growth detection in steel plates through the analysis of cumulative duration of strain events measured by a self-powered sensing paradigm at preselected level discretization. In order to evaluate the proposed method, experimental and numerical studies were performed on a thin steel plate subjected to in-plane tension. Damage was introduced by making notches with different sizes. Piezoelectric transducers were placed on the surface of the plate to measure the delivered voltage in each damage growth phase. Three-dimensional finite element models were developed to extract the strains induced by the dynamic loading. Thereafter, features extracted from the dynamic strain data for a number of sensing nodes were used to detect the damage progression. Furthermore, a new data fusion concept based on the effect of group of sensors was proposed to improve the damage detection performance. The results indicate that the proposed method is efficient in detecting different damage states in steel plates."
Continuous health monitoring of pavement systems using smart sensing technology,"Amir H. Alavi, Hassene Hasni, Nizar Lajnef, Karim Chatti, ","Construction and Building Materials, Volume 114, 1 July 2016, Pages 719-736, ","Recently, significant attention has been devoted to the utilization of new sensing technologies for pavement maintenance and preservation systems. This study presents a new approach for the continuous health monitoring of asphalt concrete pavements based on piezoelectric self-powered sensing technology. The beauty of this technology is that the signal sensed by the piezoelectric transducers from traffic loading can be used both for empowering the self-powered sensors and damage diagnosis. Numerical and experimental studies were carried out to evaluate the damage detection performance of the proposed self-sustained sensing system. A three-dimensional finite element analysis was performed to obtain the pavement responses under moving tire loading. Damage was introduced as bottom-up fatigue cracks at the bottom of the asphalt layer. Thereafter, features extracted from the dynamic strain data for a number of sensing nodes were used to detect the damage progression. The laboratory tests were carried out on an asphalt concrete specimen in three point bending mode. For the protection of the embedded sensors, a new miniaturized spherical packaging system was designed and tested. Based on the results of the numerical study, the sensing nodes located along the loading path are capable of detecting the damage progression. Besides, the experimental study indicates that the proposed method is efficient in detecting different damage states including crack propagation. Finally, the possibility of localizing the damage and quantifying its severity was investigated and discussed."
An improved NSGA-III algorithm with adaptive mutation operator for Big Data optimization problems,"Jiao-Hong Yi, Suash Deb, Junyu Dong, Amir H. Alavi, Gai-Ge Wang, ","Future Generation Computer Systems, Volume 88, November 2018, Pages 571-585, ","One of the major challenges of solving Big Data optimization problems via traditional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is their high computational costs. This issue has been efficiently tackled by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, the third version, (NSGA-III). On the other hand, a concern about the NSGA-III algorithm is that it uses a fixed rate for mutation operator. To cope with this issue, this study introduces an adaptive mutation operator to enhance the performance of the standard NSGA-III algorithm. The proposed adaptive mutation operator strategy is evaluated using three crossover operators of NSGA-III including simulated binary crossover (SBX), uniform crossover (UC) and single point crossover (SI). Subsequently, three improved NSGA-III algorithms (NSGA-III SBXAM, NSGA-III SIAM, and NSGA-III UCAM) are developed. These enhanced algorithms are then implemented to solve a number of Big Data optimization problems. Experimental results indicate that NSGA-III with UC and adaptive mutation operator outperforms the other NSGA-III algorithms."

New design equations for estimation of ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundations resting on rock masses,"Amir H. Alavi, Ehsan Sadrossadat, ","Geoscience Frontiers, Volume 7, Issue 1, January 2016, Pages 91-99, ","Rock masses are commonly used as the underlying layer of important structures such as bridges, dams and transportation constructions. The success of a foundation design for such structures mainly depends on the accuracy of estimating the bearing capacity of rock beneath them. Several traditional numerical approaches are proposed for the estimation of the bearing capacity of foundations resting on rock masses to avoid performing elaborate and expensive experimental studies. Despite this fact, there still exists a serious need to develop more robust predictive models. This paper proposes new nonlinear prediction models for the ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundations resting on non-fractured rock masses using a novel evolutionary computational approach, called linear genetic programming. A comprehensive set of rock socket, centrifuge rock socket, plate load and large-scaled footing load test results is used to develop the models. In order to verify the validity of the models, the sensitivity analysis is conducted and discussed. The results indicate that the proposed models accurately characterize the bearing capacity of shallow foundations. The correlation coefficients between the experimental and predicted bearing capacity values are equal to 0.95 and 0.96 for the best LGP models. Moreover, the derived models reach a notably better prediction performance than the traditional equations.Download high-res image (141KB)Download full-size image"
Synchronous Big Data analytics for personalized and remote physical therapy,"Prasad Calyam, Anup Mishra, Ronny Bazan Antequera, Dmitrii Chemodanov, Marjorie Skubic, ","Pervasive and Mobile Computing, Volume 28, June 2016, Pages 3-20, ","With gigabit networking becoming economically feasible and widely installed at homes, there are new opportunities to revisit in-home, personalized telehealth services. In this paper, we describe a novel telehealth eldercare service that we developed viz., ※PhysicalTherapy-as-a-Service§ (PTaaS) that connects a remote physical therapist at a clinic to a senior at home. The service leverages a high-speed, low-latency network connection through an interactive interface built on top of Microsoft Kinect motion sensing capabilities. The interface that is built using user-centered design principles for wellness coaching exercises is essentially a ＆Synchronous Big Data＊ application due to its: (i) high data-in-motion velocity (i.e., peak data rate is ＞400 Mbps), (ii) considerable variety (i.e., measurements include 3D sensing, network health, user opinion surveys and video clips of RGB, skeletal and depth data), and (iii) large volume (i.e., several GB of measurement data for a simple exercise activity). The successful PTaaS delivery through this interface is dependent on the veracity analytics needed for correlation of the real-time Big Data streams within a session, in order to assess exercise balance of the senior without any bias due to network quality effects. Our experiments with PTaaS in an actual testbed involving senior homes in Kansas City with Google Fiber connections and our university clinic demonstrate the network configuration and time synchronization related challenges in order to perform online analytics. Our findings provide insights on how to: (a) enable suitable resource calibration and perform network troubleshooting for high user experience for both the therapist and the senior, and (b) realize a Big Data architecture for PTaaS and other similar personalized healthcare services to be remotely delivered at a large-scale in a reliable, secure and cost-effective manner."

This study presents a novel class of graphene-reinforced MMB (GR-MMB) with arbitrarily periodic webbing. A size-dependent theoretical model is developed to predict and control the buckling response of the GR-MMB. The modified couple stress theory is expanded to include the effective material properties of microstructures. Clamped-clamped and simply supported GR-MMB with oval, hexagonal and cylindrical webbing patterns are showcased. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical model and satisfactory agreements are obtained.

The enhancement factor of the axial force between the GR-MMB and MMB, 肉, is studied with respect to the material ratio and geometric ratio. Density plots of the presented microstructures are provided to demonstrate the desired geometries that lead to the highest axial load and largest webbing diameter, i.e., lowest self-weight.

Improving application behavior on heterogeneous manycore systems through kernel mapping,"Omer Erdil Albayrak, Ismail Akturk, Ozcan Ozturk, ","Parallel Computing, Volume 39, Issue 12, December 2013, Pages 867-878, ","Many-core accelerators are being more frequently deployed to improve the system processing capabilities. In such systems, application mapping must be enhanced to maximize utilization of the underlying architecture. Especially, in graphics processing units (GPUs), mapping kernels that are part of multi-kernel applications has a great impact on overall performance, since kernels may exhibit different characteristics on different CPUs and GPUs. While some kernels run faster on GPUs, others may perform better in CPUs. Thus, heterogeneous execution may yield better performance than executing the application only on a CPU or only on a GPU. In this paper, we investigate on two approaches: a novel profiling-based adaptive kernel mapping algorithm to assign each kernel of an application to the proper device, and a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) implementation to determine optimal mapping. We utilize profiling information for kernels on different devices and generate a map that identifies which kernel should run where in order to improve the overall performance of an application. Initial experiments show that our approach can efficiently map kernels on CPUs and GPUs, and outperforms CPU-only and GPU-only approaches."

Fertilizer placement and application timing as strategies to reduce phosphorus loading to Lake Erie,"Marie Gildow, Noel Aloysius, Seyoum Gebremariam, Jay Martin, ","Journal of Great Lakes Research, Volume 42, Issue 6, December 2016, Pages 1281-1288, ","To reduce the intensity and frequency of harmful algal blooms in western Lake Erie, it has been recommended to reduce the phosphorus load, contributed by the Maumee River watershed (MRW) in northwest Ohio. As the largest contributor of phosphorus to Lake Erie, the dominantly agricultural MRW in northwest Ohio has been recommended to reduce phosphorus loads by 40%. To achieve such reductions, three agricultural nutrient management practices, (1) fertilizer placement within the soil, (2) adjusted seasonal timing of fertilizer application, and (3) adjusted date of fertilizer application to drier days have been recommended. To determine the potential phosphorus load reduction from implementing these three management practices, a SWAT model of the MRW was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of each practice for reducing SRP and total phosphorus (TP) load to the lake. Management scenarios were modeled with variations of the three practices from 2007 to 2012, and compared to historical data. Overall, maximum fertilizer placement had the greatest potential to influence SRP and TP loads; reducing spring SRP and TP loading by 42% and 27%, respectively compared to baseline levels. Seasonal fertilizer application timing also impacted spring SRP and TP loads, but to a lesser degree. Changing the date of application from wetter days to drier days across the watershed did not significantly affect SRP or TP loads, but this result is likely due to limitations of the SWAT simulation. These results indicate that maximizing fertilizer placement has a great potential to reduce TP and SRP runoff from the MRW."

Cellular and synaptic reorganization of arcuate NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons after Exercise,"Zhenyan He, Yong Gao, Amber L. Alhadeff, Carlos Castorena, Kevin W. Williams, ","Molecular Metabolism, In press, accepted manuscript, Available online 12 September 2018, ","Hypothalamic Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and Neuropeptide Y/Agouti-Related Peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons are critical nodes of a circuit within the brain that sense key metabolic cues as well as regulate metabolism. Importantly, these neurons retain an innate ability to rapidly reorganize synaptic inputs and electrophysiological properties in response to metabolic state. While the cellular properties of these neurons have been investigated in the context of obesity, much less is known about the effects of exercise training.In order to further investigate this issue, we utilized neuron-specific transgenic mouse models to identify POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons for patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments.Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, we found exercise depolarized and increased firing rate of arcuate POMC neurons. The increased excitability of POMC neurons was concomitant with increased excitatory inputs to these neurons. In agreement with recent work suggesting leptin plays an important role in the synaptic (re)organization of POMC neurons, POMC neurons which express leptin receptors were more sensitive to exercise-induced changes in biophysical properties. Opposite to effects observed in POMC neurons, NPY neurons were shunted toward inhibition following exercise.Together, these data support a rapid reorganization of synaptic inputs and biophysical properties in response to exercise, which may facilitate adaptations to altered energy balance and glucose metabolism."

The creation of these nanoengineered 3D architectures remains one of the most important challenges in nanotechnology. These systems have high potential as supercapacitors, catalytic electrodes, artificial muscles and in environmental applications. 3D macrostructures are formed due to an elevated density of CNTs. The quantity and quality of the CNTs are directly related to the catalyst properties. A heat treatment study was performed to produce the most effective catalyst. Factors such as superficial area, spinel inversion, crystallite size, degree of agglomeration and its correlation with van der Waals forces were examined.

Assessing the suitability of the Soil Vulnerability Index (SVI) on identifying croplands vulnerable to nitrogen loss using the SWAT model,"Sangchul Lee, Ali M. Sadeghi, Gregory W. McCarty, Claire Baffaut, Carlington Wallace, ","CATENA, Volume 167, August 2018, Pages 1-12, ","Conservation practices are effective ways to mitigate non-point source pollutions, especially when implemented on critical source areas (CSAs) known as the areas contributing disproportionately high pollution loads. Although hydrologic models are promising tools to identify CSAs within agricultural landscapes, their application is limited to areas where data and modeling expertise are available. The Soil Vulnerability Index (SVI) developed by the USDA-Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) is regarded as a potentially powerful tool for supporting initial classification of inherent soil vulnerabilities at field scale and so could be useful for CSA identification. Its usefulness is being fully evaluated in this project and as part of a larger coordinated study. This particular study evaluated the suitability of the SVI classification scheme for identifying inherent vulnerability of cultivated soils to nitrate and organic N transport by surface runoff and nitrate leaching on two adjacent watersheds with contrasting soil drainage characteristics. We used simulated nitrate and organic N fluxes from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) as reference data. The results showed that the SVI runoff classification scheme was more suitable for organic N while the SVI leaching classification scheme was suited for nitrate due to pollutant transport characteristics. In addition, the SVI leaching classification scheme was more suitable for the poorly-drained croplands than the well-drained croplands. The SVI leaching classification scheme and SWAT output consistently classified nitrate leaching vulnerability based on soil drainage characteristics for the poorly-drained croplands, while the well-drained croplands were highly sensitive to a soil water content characteristic (i.e., gravitational water). Depending on the selection of reference data and test sites, however, the suitability of the SVI classification scheme could differ. Therefore, additional evaluation of the SVI using multiple validation data and sites is highly required to demonstrate its usefulness."

To investigate the effects of current and possible Chinese DECAs policies, a model is presented for the forecast of shipping emissions and evaluation of potential costs and benefits of an DECA policy package set in 2020. It includes a port-level and regional-level projection accounting for shipping trade volume growth, share of ship types, and fuel consumption. The results show that without control measures, both SO2 and particulate matter (PM) emissions are expected to increase by 15.3每61.2% in Jing-Jin-Ji, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta from 2013 to 2020. However, most emissions can be reduced annually by the establishment of a DECA that depends on the size of the control area and the fuel sulphur content limit. Costs range from 0.667 to 1.561 billion dollars (control regional shipping emissions) based on current fuel price. A social cost method shows the regional control scenarios benefit-cost ratios vary from 4.3 to 5.1 with large uncertainty. Chemical transportation model combined with health model method is used to get the monetary health benefits and then compared with the results from social cost method. This study suggests that Chinese DECAs will reduce the projected emissions at a favorable benefit-cost ratio, and furthermore proposes policy combinations that provide high cost-effective benefits as a reference for future policy-making.Download high-res image (278KB)Download full-size image"

Airway responsiveness to acetylcholine aerosol was examined 2 h after exposure. In control animals, the provocative concentration of acetylcholine which caused a 200% increase in pulmonary resistance over baseline (PC200) was significantly less (p<0.05) after exposure to TDI (8.6+2.0 mg/ml, geometric mean + geometric SE, n=10) than after exposure to air (23.9+2.5mg/ml, n=14). The airway responsiveness to acetylcholine in animals treated with indomethacin or piriprost and exposed to TDI was not different from that of control animals exposed to TDI. Treatment with BW755c enhanced the airway hyperresponsiveness observed in animals exposed to TDI without altering the PC200 of animals exposed to air. The PC200 of animals treated with BW755c and exposed to TDI (2.3+0.8 mg/ml, n=8) was significantly lower than the PC200 of control animals exposed to TDI (p<0.025). These results suggest that products of arachidonic acid metabolism are not responsible for TDI-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in guinea pigs. BW755c, however, appears to potentiate the TDI-induced airway hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine by an as yet unidentified mechanism."

Activation of innate immune responses in a pathogen-mimicking manner by amphiphilic polyanhydride nanoparticle adjuvants,"Latrisha K. Petersen, Amanda E. Ramer-Tait, Scott R. Broderick, Chang-Sun Kong, Balaji Narasimhan, ","Biomaterials, Volume 32, Issue 28, October 2011, Pages 6815-6822, ","Techniques in materials design, immunophenotyping, and informatics can be valuable tools for using a molecular based approach to design vaccine adjuvants capable of inducing protective immunity that mimics a natural infection but without the toxic side effects. This work describes the molecular design of amphiphilic polyanhydride nanoparticles that activate antigen presenting cells in a pathogen-mimicking manner. Biodegradable polyanhydrides are well suited as vaccine delivery vehicles due to their adjuvant-like ability to: 1) enhance the immune response, 2) preserve protein structure, and 3) control protein release. The results of these studies indicate that amphiphilic nanoparticles possess pathogen-mimicking properties as evidenced by their ability to activate dendritic cells similarly to LPS. Specific molecular descriptors responsible for this behavior were identified using informatics analyses, including the number of backbone oxygen moieties, percent of hydroxyl end groups, polymer hydrophobicity, and number of alkyl ethers. Additional findings from this work suggest that the molecular characteristics mediating APC activation are not limited to hydrophobicity but vary in complexity (e.g., presentation of oxygen-rich molecular patterns to cells) and elicit unique patterns of cellular activation. The approach outlined herein demonstrates the ability to rationally design pathogen-mimicking nanoparticle adjuvants for use in next-generation vaccines against emerging and re-emerging diseases."

The gender differences in their attitudes toward the following factors are examined: computing as a male domain, infuence of significant others, negative attitudes associated with computing and career aspirations. The results of this study show that students, especially females, are rejecting the stereotypes that are prevalent in society. This is cause for optimism and students of both genders should be encouraged to be equal heirs to a future in a technologically literate nation."

Anticoagulation is indicated in the presence of cancer-associated thrombosis in order to limit the risk of pulmonary embolism; however, there is reluctance to initiate anticoagulation in the setting of intracranial metastatic disease due to potential for intracranial hemorrhage. Recent evidence suggests that therapeutic anticoagulation can be safely administered in the setting of metastatic brain tumors. This review examines the current understanding of the pathophysiology of intracranial hemorrhage in malignancy, describes the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of brain tumors with therapeutic anticoagulation, and outlines management strategies relevant to the treatment of intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of anticoagulation."
Evaluation of effective flange width by shear lag model for orthotropic FRP bridge decks,"Bin Zou, An Chen, Julio F. Davalos, Hani A. Salim, ","Composite Structures, Volume 93, Issue 2, January 2011, Pages 474-482, ","In bridge engineering, the three-dimensional behavior of a bridge system is usually reduced to the analysis of a T-beam section with a reduced width of deck in relation to center-to-center spacing of stringers, over which the longitudinal normal stresses are assumed to be uniformly distributed, which is termed as effective flange width. It is defined in the AASHTO specifications primarily for concrete slabs and has inherent applicable limitations because of its empirical nature. This paper provides an analytical shear lag model for effective flange width for orthotropic bridge decks, applicable to various materials including Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) and concrete decks. To verify this solution, a Finite Element (FE) parametric study is conducted on 44 simply-supported FRP deck-on-steel girder bridges. The results from the shear lag model correlate well with the FE results. The accuracy of this model is further verified by close correlations with an existing empirical solution. It is also illustrated that the shear lag model, with the introduction of a reduction factor, can be applied to predict effective flange width for FRP deck-on-steel girder bridges with partial composite action, by favorable comparisons between the analytical and testing results for a T-beam section cut from a one-third scaled bridge model, which consists of an FRP sandwich deck attached to steel girders by mechanical connectors."
"IL-13, IL-4R汐, and Stat6 Are Required for the Expulsion of the Gastrointestinal Nematode Parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis","Joseph F Urban, Nancy Noben-Trauth, Debra D Donaldson, Kathleen B Madden, Fred D Finkelman, ","Immunity, Volume 8, Issue 2, 1 February 1998, Pages 255-264, ","Although IL-4 induces expulsion of the gastrointestinal nematode parasite, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, from immunodeficient mice, this parasite is expelled normally by IL-4-deficient mice. This apparent paradox is explained by observations that IL-4 receptor 汐 chain (IL-4R汐)-deficient mice and Stat6-deficient mice fail to expel N. brasiliensis, and a specific antagonist for IL-13, another activator of Stat6 through IL-4R汐, prevents worm expulsion. Thus, N. brasiliensis expulsion requires signaling via IL-4R汐 and Stat6, and IL-13 may be more important than IL-4 as an inducer of the Stat6 signaling that leads to worm expulsion. Additional observations made in the course of these experiments demonstrate that Stat6 signaling is not required for IL-4 enhancement of IgG1 production and actually inhibits IL-4-induction of mucosal mastocytosis."

The experimental program involves flexural testing of three specimens in an inverted position under four-point loading to simulate a part of continuous steel-concrete composite beams at the hogging moment region. The experimental findings are used to develop and validate a finite element (FE) model to simulate the nonlinear flexural performance of strengthened beams as well as plain beams. The good agreements between the proposed model and the test data assure an accuracy for the proposed model to predict the influence of various parameters that affect the beam capacity. The CFRP laminates enhance the beam capacity by 18% and 22% when using one and two layers, respectively. Yielding in steel rebars followed by a rupture in the CFRP laminates accompanied by diagonal cracking in the vicinity of supports is the mode of failure for the strengthened beams. To achieve optimum performance of CFRP strengthening, it is recommended that the technique be used for bridges with at least 80% composite action between the steel beam and concrete slab."

However, the effects of UFNB on standard tasks of laterality (e.g., dichotic listening) are unknown. This study employed dichotic listening for word targets, which typically exhibits a right ear advantage (REA), and dichotic listening for emotional targets, which typically exhibits a left ear advantage (LEA). Participants were asked to breathe either through their dominant nostril (congruent UFNB) or to breathe through their non-dominant nostril (incongruent UFNB) for the entire testing session. There was a significant three-way interaction between the type of dichotic listening task, nostril dominance, and nostril assignment, with the expected REA for word targets and the expected LEA for emotional targets〞with one exception. Right nostril dominant participants assigned to the congruent condition exhibited an LEA for emotional targets (p<.05). The other three groups exhibited the expected LEA/right hemisphere advantage for the detection of emotional targets and all groups exhibited the expected REA/left hemisphere advantage for detection of word targets. As such, possible bias induced by tactile stimulation of the contralateral face cannot account for these results. Thus, our data are consistent with a selective enhancement of right hemispheric lateralized functions by right nostril UFNB."

A basic life support (BLS) motorcycle (without defibrillation capability) and an advanced life support (ALS) ambulance were based at three study hospitals and simultaneously dispatched when there was a perceived need for ALS ambulance transport. Over a 3-month period, prehospital personnel evaluated 307 medical and trauma emergencies. Time data were insufficient for analysis in 33 cases, leaving a study population of 274. Response times of the motorcycle and the ambulance were prospectively assessed and compared. During rush hours, the response times of the motorcycle and ambulance were 4.9 ㊣ 3.0 minutes and 6.3 ㊣ 3.4 minutes (P < .05), respectively, and in non-rush hours, 4.2 ㊣ 2.1 minutes and 5.1 ㊣ 2.5 minutes (P < .05), respectively. Using motorcycles to transport EMTs to the emergency scene significantly reduced response time compared with a standard ambulance in a congested urban setting. Large prospective studies are required to determine the impact on patient outcome of shorter EMS response times using motorcycles. EMS motorcycles appear feasible and deserve consideration to help expedite prehospital care in other systems in densely populated cities."

There is, however, no reason to suppose that cladistics is not applicable to anything that evolves by cladogenesis and produces a nested hierarchy of taxa. This includes cultural phenomena such as languages and tools recovered from archaeological contexts. Two methodological issues assume primacy in attempts to extend cladistics to archaeological materials: the construction of analytical taxa and the selection of appropriate outgroups. In biology the species is the primary taxonomic unit used, irrespective of the debates that have arisen in phylogenetic theory over the nature of species. Also in biology the phylogenetic history of a group of taxa usually is well enough known that an appropriate taxon can be selected as an outgroup. No analytical unit parallel to the species exists in archaeology, and thus taxa have to be constructed specifically for phylogenetic analysis. One method of constructing taxa is paradigmatic classification, which defines classes (taxa) on the basis of co-occurring, unweighted character states. Once classes have been created, a form of occurrence seriation〞an archaeological method based on the theory of cultural transmission and heritability〞offers an objective basis for selecting an outgroup."

This paper is focused on the evaluation of the static blast-resistance of conventional cold-formed steel stud wall systems. A general analytical model of the resistance, which is the first necessary step for performing dynamic response predictions under blast, is presented in this paper. A case study of sufficiently screwed stud-to-track connection is selected for further inspection and investigation. Particular emphasis is placed on the effect of including utility holes and sheathing on the static resistance of the wall system. For each experimental test, strain data were collected up to the failure point from a total of 11 longitudinal strain gauges installed on locations of interest. A finite element model was developed to include the sheathing effect and to add flexibility to the simulation of the conventional connection. Strain results provided insightful observations about the behavior of the stud and were used to validate the numerical simulations as well."

Engineering of Thiamine Pyrophosphate Fluorescent Biosensors Based on Ribozyme Switches in Mammalian Cells,"Yuan-Yuan ZHANG, Hui CHENG, Yan SUN, Jin-E WANG, Ren-Jun PEI, ","Chinese Journal of Analytical Chemistry, Volume 45, Issue 2, February 2017, Pages 157-162, ","As the main active form of intracellular thiamine (vitamin B1), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is an essential cofactor in oxidative metabolism of the sugars, fatty acids and amino acids. By now, numerous TPP-dependent artificial riboswitch systems have been developed to regulate target gene expression but are limited in bacteria, fungi or plant cells. Herein, the activating (switch-on) and inhibiting (switch-off) TPP-dependent hammerhead ribozyme switches, inspired by the previously reported structures of prokaryotes screening, were investigated in mammalian cells. Such ribozyme switches were inserted into the 3∩-UTR of the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene through overlap extension PCR cloning and were further transfected into HEK293 cells at increasing concentrations of TPP. The EGFP gene-regulatory ability was analyzed with fluorescent microscope and flow cytometry. These resultant TPP-inducible gene regulation devices showed obvious ligand dose-dependency and excellent specificity. Upon the addition of 150 米M TPP, two ※switch-on§ and one ※switch-off§ constructs demonstrated 3.1-fold or 1.9-fold increment and 2.3-fold reduction of EGFP level, respectively. The ligand-responsive ribozyme switches, by transforming the change of TPP concentration into the visual reporter genetic expression in cells, enable efficient development of label-free, noninvasive and high specific biosensors in living mammalian cells.TPP hammerhead ribozymes as the regulatory components for EGFP gene expression is in living mammalian cells. ※Switch-off§ ribozymes increase pre-mRNA cleavage in the presence of TPP, which results in the decrease of EGFP gene expression. ※Switch-on§ ribozymes shut off self-cleavage of pre-mRNA upon the external addition of TPP, which leads to the increase of EGFP gene expression."

Two heating schemes (surface heating and body heating) and two beam profiles (flat beam and Gaussian beam) are examined in detail. The numerical results indicate that the DPL bioheat conduction model describes different thermal responses from the thermal-wave and Pennes' bioheat conduction models, depending on the values of the two lagging times. For a local heating with the heated spot smaller than the tissue bulk, the variations of the non-uniform distributions of temperature suggest that the multi-dimensional effects of thermal wave and diffusion not be negligible. It is also found that due to the presence of blood perfusion in living tissues, the present DPL bioheat conduction model reduces to the Pennes' bioheat model only when 而q=而T=0."

In this study, we used an anaerobic microcosm experiment to examine how the removal rates of 2,2∩,4,4∩-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) from contaminated sediment varied when exposed to three wastewaters with different nutrient properties, namely livestock wastewater (LS), municipal sewage (MS), and shrimp pond wastewater (SP), and to determine the microbial controls on removal processes. We found that BDE-47 degraded relatively rapidly in MS, which had low carbon and nitrogen concentrations, but degraded much more slowly in LS and SP, which had relatively high nutrient concentrations. The variations in BDE-47 removal in different wastewater were related to iron reduction rates and the abundances of organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB). The community compositions of both total bacteria and OHRB from the family Dehalococcoidaceae differed significantly among the wastewater treatments. Compared with other treatments, some bacterial groups with PBDE degradation abilities were more abundant in MS where the PBDE-degradation efficiencies were higher. Our results should help support evaluations of the bioremediation potential of sites that are contaminated with both halogenated organic compounds and nutrient-rich wastewater.Download high-res image (178KB)Download full-size image"
Simulation of thermoelastic crack problems using singular edge-based smoothed finite element method,"Haodong Chen, Qingsong Wang, G. R. Liu, Yu Wang, Jinhua Sun, ","International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, Volumes 115每116, September 2016, Pages 123-134, ","This paper presents a singular edge-based smoothed finite element method (ES-FEM) for solving two-dimensional thermoelastic crack problems. The physical domain is first discretized using linear triangular elements which can be generated easily for complicated geometries, and then the smoothing domains are constructed based on edges of these elements. Each smoothing domain is bounded by a set of enclosed line segments. The finite element equations are obtained utilizing the smoothed Galerkin weak form with edge-based smoothing domains. One needs only values of assumed temperature/displacement on each segment of the smoothing domains to form thermal stiffness matrix/stiffness matrix of the system. To produce the proper stress singularity, a layer of five-node crack-tip elements is designed around a crack tip. The stress intensity factors are evaluated using interaction integral with the domain form. Several numerical examples with different boundary conditions are investigated and the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the reference solutions. The thermal and mechanical influence on the crack growth is explored with different thermal and mechanical conditions. It has been found that the present method is more accurate than standard finite element method (FEM) using the same mesh."
Locality-constrained least squares regression for subspace clustering,"Yuanyuan Chen, Zhang Yi, ","Knowledge-Based Systems, In press, corrected proof, Available online 16 August 2018, ","Low-rank representation (LRR) is a typical data representation method that has been developed in recent years. Based on the main idea of LRR, least squares regression (LSR) constructs a new optimization problem to group the highly correlated data together. Compared with other LRR algorithms that are sophisticated, LSR is simpler and more efficient. It is a linear representation method that captures the global structure of data with a low-rank constraint. Research has shown that locality constraints typically improve the discrimination of the representation and demonstrate better performance than those ※non-local§ methods for image recognition tasks. To combine LSR and the locality constraints, we propose a novel data representation method called locality-constrained LSR (LCLSR) for subspace clustering. LCLSR forces the representation to prefer the selection of neighborhood points. The locality constraint is calculated based on the Euclidean distances between data points. Under the locality constraint, the obtained affinity matrix captures the locally linear relationship for data points lie on a nonlinear manifold. We propose three approaches to obtain the locality constraint and compare their performance with other related work on subspace clustering. We conducted extensive experiments on several datasets for subspace clustering.

An evidence-based approach to the surgical interventions for severe pancreatic fistula after pancreatoduodenectomy,"Yan-Ming Zhou, Xin Zhou, Tao Wan, Dong Xu, Xiao-Ying Si, ","The Surgeon, Volume 16, Issue 2, April 2018, Pages 119-124, ","To assess the safety and therapeutic outcome of different surgical interventions for severe pancreatic fistula after pancreatoduodenectomy.A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed database for relevant articles published between 1990 and March 2017. Descriptive statistics were performed and data are expressed as mean.Twenty-four studies involving 370 patients undergoing surgical interventions for severe pancreatic fistula after pancreatoduodenectomy were included. Rates of further relaparotomy, in-hospital mortality, and long-term endocrine insufficiency were reported for completion pancreatectomy (31.8%, 42% and 100% respectively), disconnection of anastomosis with preservation of a pancreatic remnant (25%, 21.3% and 17.8% respectively), internal or external wirsungostomy (10.4%, 14.9%, and 12.3% respectively), salvage pancreaticogastrostomy (12.5%, 0% and 25%, respectively), and simple peripancreatic drainage (30%, 47.9% and 12.5%, respectively).The pancreas-preserving strategy of disconnection of anastomosis with preservation of a pancreatic remnant, internal or external wirsungostomy, and salvage pancreatogastrostomy seems to be the preferred option for the treatment of severe pancreatic fistula after pancreatoduodenectomy. As completion pancreatectomy is a very aggressive treatment, it should only be reserved for specific instances in which organ-preserving resection is technically unfeasible."
Comparative experimental study on pool boiling performance of porous coating and solid structures with reentrant channels,"Daxiang Deng, Wei Wan, Junyuan Feng, Qingsong Huang, Yanlin Xie, ","Applied Thermal Engineering, Volume 107, 25 August 2016, Pages 420-430, ","Pool boiling heat transfer in a porous coating with reentrant channels was experimentally studied together with the comparison of a solid sample with the same reentrant configurations. The porous coating was totally constructed by sintered copper powder, and featured 12 parallel 次-shaped reentrant channels. Pool boiling tests were conducted using two coolants (deionized water and ethanol) in different liquid subcoolings at atmospheric pressure. The boiling heat transfer performance was systematically examined and compared together with the high-speed visualization observations. Experimental results revealed that the porous coating introduced a great decrease in wall superheat at the onset of nucleate boiling (ONB), and a significant enhancement in boiling heat transfer at low to moderate heat fluxes compared to its solid counterpart. The porous coating promoted the boiling nucleation significantly by increasing the nucleation sites and hindering early condensation of vapor embryos. Liquid replenishment through the horizontal reentrant channels and efficient surface rewetting were maintained even at high heat fluxes. Moreover, the effects of liquid subcooling on the boiling heat transfer performance of both porous and solid sample were also assessed."
Recent Developments in Single-Cell RNA-Seq of Microorganisms,"Yi Zhang, Jiaxin Gao, Yanyi Huang, Jianbin Wang, ","Biophysical Journal, Volume 115, Issue 2, 17 July 2018, Pages 173-180, ","Single-cell transcriptome analysis through next-generation sequencing (single-cell RNA-seq) has been used broadly to address important biological questions. It has proved to be very powerful, and many exciting new biological discoveries have been achieved in the last decade. Its application has greatly improved our understanding of diverse biological processes and the underlying molecular mechanisms, an understanding that would not have been achievable by conventional analysis based on bulk populations. However, so far, single-cell RNA-seq analysis has been used mostly for higher organisms. For microorganisms, single-cell RNA-seq has not been widely used, mainly because the stiff cell wall prevents effective lysis, much less starting RNA material is obtained, and the RNA lacks polyadenylated tails for universal priming of mRNA molecules. In general, the detection efficiency of current single-cell RNA-seq technologies is very low, and further development or improvement of these technologies is required for exploring the microbial world at single-cell resolution. Here, we briefly review recent developments in single-cell RNA-seq of microorganisms and discuss current challenges and future directions."

Involvement of NADPH oxidase and NF-百B activation in CXCL1 induction by vascular endothelial growth factor in human endometrial epithelial cells of patients with adenomyosis,"Tsung-Hsuan Lai, Pi-Hui Wu, Wen-Bin Wu, ","Journal of Reproductive Immunology, Volume 118, November 2016, Pages 61-69, ","Chemokines were known to participate in inflammation and angiogenesis but have been recently recognized to be involved in embryonic implantation and endometrium-related pathologies. Among these chemokines, the CXC chemokines, such as CXCL1, have potential roles to work as biomarkers to identify patients with uterine adenomyosis. In this study, human endometrial epithelial cells (HEECs) were derived from patients＊ endometrium with adenomyosis. The inductive effects of CXCL1 production by various mediators/growth factors were investigated in the HEECs. Of the tested mediators, VEGF was found to be the most effective. The immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR analysis revealed a positive staining for VEGF and CXCL1 at the epithelium and the presence of CXCL1 in the human endometrium specimens, respectively. The CXCL1 induction by VEGF could be reduced by the antagonist for VEGF receptor (VEGFR), and by the inhibitors for NADPH oxidase and NF-百B signaling pathway. However, it was not affected by sex hormones and the inhibitors for MAPKs, PI-3K, protein kinase A and C. In parallel, VEGF induced p47 phox NADPH oxidase activation, I百B汐 phosphorylation, NF-百B translocation and NF-百B-DNA complex formation in the HEECs. Moreover, the CXCL1 released by the HEECs with VEGF stimulation attracted vascular endothelial cell migration. Taken together, we show that VEGF and CXCL1 are expressed in epithelium of the endometrium with adenomyosis and demonstrate here for the first time that VEGF is capable of inducing CXCL1 expression in HEECs through VEGFR, p47 phox NADPH oxidase and NF-百B signaling pathway, which is functionally required for attracting vascular endothelial cell migration.Download high-res image (62KB)Download full-size image"

And we showed that circMYO9B expression was positively correlated with patients' prognosis. Moreover, we found that circMYO9B knockdown significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of BC cells in vitro. In vivo assays also indicated that circMYO9B silence delayed tumor growth. In mechanism, we found that circMYO9B promoted the expression of FOXP4 by sponging miR-4316 in BC cells. We showed that the expression of miR-4316 was inversely associated with that of circMYO9B or FOXP4 in BC tissues. Finally, we found that restoration of FOXP4 expression significantly reversed the effects of circMYO9B knockdown on BC cell proliferation, migration and invasion.

The thermal decomposition and crystallization process of the ceramic fibers were fully characterized. Different atmosphere preheat treatment results suggested that water vapor promoted the thermal decomposition and crystallization of precursor fibers at a lower temperature. Three kinds of particles, including round particles, polyhedron particles to plate particles in the microstructure of the fibers could be manipulated by adjusting the water vapor preheat treatment. The change in textural properties (BET surface area, pore size and pore volume) of the MgO fibers, heated at different temperatures in air after pre-heated treatment in water vapor, was analyzed. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms of the microstructures of the fibers were also presented. The easy manipulation of the microstructures of MgO ceramic fibers may make it a promising material in various areas."

Besides, TF expression was also highly up-regulated in the Kupffer cells (KCs) of SAP mouse model. After inhibiting KCs in SAP mouse model, the amelioration of blood coagulation system functions was associated with the decrease in serum TF and TF-MPs levels, and the reduction of SAP-associated liver injury was associated with the decrease of TF expression in KCs. In conclusion, the dis-regulated TF expression and associated dysfunction of blood coagulation system are critical factors for the pathogenesis of SAP and SAP-associated liver injury.

A hybrid model integrating improved flower pollination algorithm-based feature selection and improved random forest for NOX emission estimation of coal-fired power plants,"Fang Wang, Suxia Ma, He Wang, Yaodong Li, Junjie Zhang, ","Measurement, Volume 125, September 2018, Pages 303-312, ","Combustion optimization is an effective technique for energy conservation in power plants. An accurate NOX emission estimation model is crucial for combustion optimization. A novel NOX emission estimation model is proposed that integrates an improved random forest (RF) and a wrapper feature selection based on an improved binary flower pollination algorithm (FPA). Three improvements to the basic FPA are proposed, an elite-selection strategy, a mutation operator, and a dynamic switch probability. Moreover, the optimization precision of the proposed FPA is compared to those of five other optimization algorithms. A feature selection method based on the proposed FPA is employed to identify the optimal inputs for the NOX emission model. In addition, a fine-tuning mechanism to update the population (based on mutual information) is designed and embedded in the feature selection process to speed up convergence. To improve the basic RF, an ensemble pruning algorithm based on a back propagation neural network that can evaluate the importance of each tree and prune ※detrimental§ trees is developed. With the optimal inputs, the NOX emission model is constructed using the improved RF. The prediction results demonstrate that it is of higher accuracy and better robustness compared to the basic RF and the three other models. The designed feature selection could also decrease the computational complexity and improve the prediction accuracy.Download high-res image (142KB)Download full-size image"
Object detection among multimedia big data in the compressive measurement domain under mobile distributed architecture,"Jie Guo, Bin Song, Fei Richard Yu, Zheng Yan, Laurence T. Yang, ","Future Generation Computer Systems, Volume 76, November 2017, Pages 519-527, ","Multimedia big data is difficult to handle because of its enormous amount and the elusive property of underlying information. To study how to explore valuable information among multimedia big data with low complexity, this paper proposes an object detection method of big data, which is in compressive measurement domain under a mobile distributed computing architecture. It includes the sparse representation and object detection processes. Considering the unbalanced computation capacity between a mobile center cloud and mobile edge sites, we shift large storage burden into the cloud, while performing the dictionary learning by using compressive measurements in the mobile edge sites. Specifically, after getting the measurements at the edge sites, we perform dictionary learning to obtain the sparse representation in pixel domain, then select significant images and their feature vectors to be stored in the center cloud. In addition, we also analyze the trained dictionary in the measurement domain employing measurements. In order to reveal the two kinds of dictionaries＊ relationship, we conduct a formulation process into each of them and find that the relationship depends on the uniqueness relation between the original signal and the sparse coefficient in the measurement domain. At the same time, we keep coefficients for a certain time period at the mobile edge sites in order to realize real time object detection, taking the advantage of low latency of the mobile edge computing ends. Since the sparse coefficients and the original signal have a one-to-one correspondence relationship, we can just search for the matched coefficients of the image block for detecting object. Experimental results show that Hadamard measurement matrix can better preserve the characteristics of the original signal than Gaussian matrix and that the proposed method can achieve a favorable detection performance. Meanwhile, the computation cost and storage cost of the proposed detection process can be significantly reduced compared with traditional methods, which is suitable for the multimedia big data. This can also be used in smart cities for looking for lost children and other specific events."
Reliability analysis of random vibration transmission path systems,"Wei Zhao, Yi-Min Zhang, ","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, Volume 113, December 2018, Pages 77-89, ","The vibration transmission path systems are generally composed of the vibration source, the vibration transfer path and the vibration receiving structure. The transfer path is the medium of the vibration transmission. Therefore, the uncertainty of path parameters influences the system reliability greatly. In order to avoid the resonance failure, the transmission reliability analysis and the reliability sensitivity analysis are both very important. Based on the reliability theory, the absolute value difference of natural frequency and excitation frequency of random vibration transmission path system was limited and the reliability pattern of the resonance problem was defined in this paper. Applying the generalized second moment technique of vector-valued functions and the stochastic finite element theory, the theoretical analysis method of the transmission reliability and reliability sensitivity was presented. The corresponding vibration transmission path system with uncertain path parameters including mass, stiffness and path position was analyzed theoretically and computed numerically, and then the correlated mathematical expressions were obtained. Thus, in practical project, most of uncertain factors in the vibration systems can be analyzed so that the effective way can be given to avoid resonance failure."
Progressive alterations of hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses in an animal model of depression,"Hui Qiao, Shu-Cheng An, Wei Ren, Xin-Ming Ma, ","Behavioural Brain Research, Volume 275, 15 December 2014, Pages 191-200, ","Major depressive disorder is the most prevalent psychiatric condition, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this disorder are largely unknown, although multiple hypotheses have been proposed. The aim of this study was to characterize the progressive alteration of neuronal plasticity in the male rat hippocampus during depression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), an established animal model of depression. The data in the hippocampus were collected on days 7, 14 and 21 after the onset of three-week CUMS. When analyzed on day 21, three-week CUMS induced typically depressive-like behaviors, impaired LTP induction, and decreased basal synaptic transmission at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses recorded in vivo, which was accompanied by decreased density of dendritic spines in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons. The levels of both Kalirin-7 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus were decreased at the same time. On day 14 (middle phase), some depressive-like behaviors were observed, which was accompanied by depressed basal synaptic transmission and enhanced LTP induction at the CA3-CA1 synapses. However, BDNF expression was decreased without alteration of Kalirin7 expression in comparison with no-stress control. Depressed basal synaptic transmission occurred in the middle phase of CUMS may contribute to decreased expression of BDNF. On day 7, depressive-like behaviors were not observed, and LTP induction, spine density, Kalirin-7 and BDNF expression were not altered by CUMS in comparison with no-stress control. These results showed that the functional changes at CA3-CA1synapses occurred earlier than the structural alteration during three-week CUMS as a strategy of neural adaptation, and rats required three weeks to develop depressive-like behaviors during CUMS. Our results suggest an important role of Kalirin-7 in CUMS-mediated alterations in spine density, synaptic function and overall depressive-like behaviors on day 21."

Thus, it is crucial for precise image navigation to do research on prediction of the performance of aero optical imaging. This paper employs a method based on the model of angular spectrum propagation to study the light transmission through the supersonic flowfields and aero optical imaging. First, the density fields are translated into the refractive index fields through the Gladstone每Dale (G每D) relationship. In this paper, each CFD grid is viewed as a uniform and isotropic cell, and it is assumed that the optical waves are propagating cell by cell. According to the angular spectrum propagation, each CFD grid is thought of as a linear spatial filter (LPF), and the supersonic flowfields are regarded as the combinations of these LPFs. The different spatial frequencies brought about by the different densities are used to analyze the influences of the density distribution on the light propagation. The proposed method can calculate the optical transformation function (OTF) and directly use it for modeling the aero optical image. In the end, the aero optical images are simulated and the centroid offsets of aero optical imaging are calculated. The results show that the proposed approach is reasonable."

Hole-selective NiO:Cu contact for NiO/Si heterojunction solar cells,"Xueliang Yang, Jianxin Guo, Yi Zhang, Wei Liu, Yun Sun, ","Journal of Alloys and Compounds, Volume 747, 30 May 2018, Pages 563-570, ","Heterojunction architectures become a major trend in the development of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) c-Si solar cell in recent. However, NiO as a prevailing material in other application is not favored in c-Si solar cells. In this study, a novel solar cell architecture using nonstoichiometric p-type NiO thin films as a hole-selective, dopant-free contact to n-type crystalline silicon (n-Si) is successfully fabricated. We achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.3% in the pure NiO/n-Si heterojunction solar cell, which is the first case to be reported. Further Cu-incorporation enhanced the work function and conductivity of NiO films (NiO:Cu, for short), increasing built-in potential and favoring hole transport in the NiO:Cu/n-Si heterojunction, which results in a record PCE of 9.1% among all bulk-like NiO/Si heterojunction solar cells. Analysis of the spectra of Cu 2p and Cu LMM Auger lines, measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), shows that the fabricated NiO:Cu film is a mixture of metallic Cu, Cu2O and CuO multi-phase coexistence. Among these species, the proper Cu incorporation contributes the improvement of acceptor concentration due to the dominant phase of Cu+, but the excessive Cu incorporation creates defect states within the band gap, increasing recombination and deteriorating interface quality, which leads to S-shape current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics."
Description and recognition of object contours using arc length and tangent orientation,"Dong Xu, Wenli Xu, ","Pattern Recognition Letters, Volume 26, Issue 7, 15 May 2005, Pages 855-864, ","We propose an object description and recognition approach based on the relationship between the arc length and tangent orientation angle of object contours in this paper. According to the approach, B-spline curves are firstly used to approximate contours to get the smooth variance of the arc length and tangent orientation angle, and then B-spline curves are divided into sets of simple patches, which compose the feature chains of contours. We also propose two description functions of contours, and discuss their invariance to translation, rotation and scaling transformations. In matching, because the features to be used are only several different patches of contours not the whole ones, our approach can be used to recognize not only objects with different scaling and poses, but also objects be partly occluded or absent. We conducted experiments with a set of airplane images and got a much high recognition rate."
Responses of Saline Soil Properties and Cotton Growth to Different Organic Amendments,"Yupeng WU, Yufei LI, Yi ZHANG, Yanmeng BI, Zhenjun SUN, ","Pedosphere, Volume 28, Issue 3, June 2018, Pages 521-529, ","Application of organic waste to saline alkaline soils is considered to be a good practice for soil remediation. The effects of applying different organic amendments (e.g., cattle dung, vermicompost, biofertilizer) and earthworm inoculations (Eisenia fetida) on saline soils and cotton growth were investigated during 1 year of cotton cultivation. Compared to the control (applied with inorganic NPK fertilizer), applying organic amendments improved soil physicochemical properties. Biofertilizer application improved available nutrient content, reduced short-term soil electrical conductivity, and produced the highest cotton yield, whereas cattle dung and vermicompost applications resulted in higher soil organic matter content. Application of organic amendments significantly increased soil microbial biomass carbon during the flowering period, which sharply declined at harvest. This was especially true for the biofertilizer treatment, which also exhibited lower nematode abundance compared with the other organic materials. Earthworm inoculation following cattle dung application failed to significantly change soil physicochemical properties when compared to the treatments without earthworm inoculation. Results suggest that biofertilizer application to saline soil would improve soil nutrient status in the short-term, whereas cattle dung application would improve soil organic matter content and increase soil organism abundance to a greater extent. However, different strategies might be required for long-term saline soil remediation."
Unconventional dark matter models: a brief review,"Yi Zhang, Yue Zhao, ","Science Bulletin, Volume 60, Issue 11, June 2015, Pages 986-994, ","Although weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) scenario is very well motivated, it is not guaranteed to be the truth. It is important to keep mind open and consider other well-motivated scenarios. In this paper, we briefly review several possible non-WIMP dark matter (DM) candidates. First, we discuss details on asymmetric DM models, in which the baryon asymmetry in standard model sector is related to the asymmetry in DM sector. We discuss how DM relic abundance is determined in such models. Also we cover the possible interesting experimental signatures induced by its asymmetric nature. Then we consider ultralight DM candidates, i.e., axion and dark photon. In such scenarios, DM should be treated as a coherently oscillating background, instead of each individual particle. Searching strategies for such DM candidates is very different than those in conventional DM models. We discuss several interesting experiments looking for these ultralight particles. We also cover interesting subtleties encountered in those experiments."

Chen, ","International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow, Volume 28, Issue 6, December 2007, Pages 1484-1491, ","In this study, a numerical model is developed to investigate the coupled compressible gas flow and heat transfer in a microchannel surrounded by solid media. To accommodate the varying flow cross-section, the compressible gas flow model is established in a non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system. An iterative numerical procedure is employed to solve the coupled heat transfer and gas flow equations. The computer code for the compressible gas flow is first validated against two test problems, and then extended by including the heat conduction in the solid media. The effect of the inlet Mach number on the Nusselt number is examined. It is found that the pressure difference from the pyrolysis front to the heated surface is induced essentially by the gas addition from the channel wall, instead from the pyrolysis front. The necessity of accounting for the gas compressibility is clearly demonstrated when severe heating is applied. The pressure distribution obtained along the channel axial direction is useful for further structural analysis of composite materials."
Effect of holding pressure on the microstructure of vacuum counter-pressure casting aluminum alloy,"QingSong Yan, Huan Yu, ZhiFeng Xu, BoWen Xiong, ChangChun Cai, ","Journal of Alloys and Compounds, Volume 501, Issue 2, 9 July 2010, Pages 352-357, ","The effect of holding pressure on the microstructure of vacuum counter-pressure casting aluminum alloy was analyzed by observing the changes of the Si phase size and alloy density.

Under the same holding pressure, the smallest extrusion and infiltration ability takes place at the middle of sample. Accordingly, from the pouring gate to middle, the microstructure of vacuum counter-pressure casting aluminum alloy sample becomes coarser, more non-uniform and less dense, while the microstructure from the middle to top becomes finer, more uniform and denser."
Extraction and analysis of city's tourism districts based on social media data,"Hu Shao, Yi Zhang, Wenwen Li, ","Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, Volume 65, September 2017, Pages 66-78, ","Through the perspective of tourism, a city as a tourist destination usually consists of multiple tourist attractions such as natural or cultural scenic spots.

It is known that users organize their tours in a city not only according to the distance between different attractions but also according to other factors such as time constraints, expenses, interests, and the similarities between different attractions. Hence, users' travel tours can help us gain a better understanding about the relationships among different attractions at the city scale. In this paper, a methodological framework is developed to detect tourists' spatial-temporal behaviors from social media data, and then such information is used to extract and analyze city's tourism districts.

Influences of initial launch conditions on flight performance of high altitude balloon ascending process,"Yi Zhang, Dongxu Liu, ","Advances in Space Research, Volume 56, Issue 4, 15 August 2015, Pages 605-618, ","Influences of initial launch conditions on flight performance are addressed for the high altitude balloon ascending process. A novel dynamic model was established to describe thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of balloon which consists of atmospheric, thermal and dynamic submodels. Based on the model, ascending processes of a high altitude balloon under different initial launch conditions were simulated. The initial launch conditions were classified into three types: inflating quantity, launch time and launch position. The ascending velocity and the differential pressure were defined and used as evaluation parameters of flight performance. Results showed that the inflating quantity is the most effective factor for ascending process, and the upper and lower limits were also proposed separately from safety and performance perspectives. For both launch time and launch location conditions, different solar radiation is the main effect approach during ascending process. Specifically, the influence mechanism of launch time in one day and launch longitude are completely identical due to the Earth＊s rotation. Results also showed that the sunset process is the optimal selection for safety of balloon and efficient utilization of solar energy. Due to the Earth＊s revolution, the influence mechanism of launch date and launch latitude are identical and the effects are more seasonal and less effective.

"Flow-induced vibrations of two side-by-side circular cylinders: Asymmetric vibration, symmetry hysteresis and near-wake patterns","Weilin Chen, Chunning Ji, Rui Wang, Dong Xu, Jordan Campbell, ","Ocean Engineering, Volume 110, Part A, 1 December 2015, Pages 244-257, ","The immersed boundary method was utilised to numerically investigate the flow-induced vibrations (FIV) of two elastically mounted side-by-side circular cylinders in a uniform flow with low Reynolds numbers. Six distinct near-wake patterns were observed; the irregular (IR) pattern, the in-phase synchronized (IS) pattern, the anti-phase synchronized (AS) pattern, the biased anti-phase synchronized (BAS) pattern, the out-of-phase flip-flopping (OFF) pattern, and the hybrid (HB) pattern. A detailed analysis on the asymmetric vibration and symmetry hysteresis phenomena was conducted by focusing on the near-wake patterns and the interaction between the cylinders. Results show that the asymmetric vibrations of the cylinders are closely related with the stably biased gap flow and the resulting narrow-wide near-wake pattern. While the symmetry hysteresis is caused by the coexistence of two distinct near-wake patterns 每 the IS and the BAS patterns. The transition processes of BAS to IS and IS to BAS were illustrated by using the long-time histories of the lift coefficients, the combined lift coefficient and the phase differences of lift and displacement. Results on hydrodynamic forces and the vibration responses show that the HB pattern is a combination of IS, OFF and AS patterns with a very long period."

A scheme for improving computational efficiency of quasi-two-dimensional model,"Tae Uk Jang, Yue-bin Wu, Ying Xu, Qiang Sun, ","Journal of Hydrodynamics, Ser. B, Volume 29, Issue 2, April 2017, Pages 243-250, ","The quasi-2D model, taking into account the axial velocity profile in the cross section and neglecting the convective term in the 2-D equation, can more accurately simulate the water hammer than the 1-D model using the cross-sectional mean velocity. However, as compared with the 1-D model, the quasi-2D model bears a higher computational burden. In order to improve the computational efficiency, the 1-D method is proposed to be used to solve directly the pressure head and the discharge in the quasi-2D model in this paper, based on the fact that the pressure head obtained as the solution of the two-dimensional characteristic equation is identical to that solved by the 1-D characteristic equations. The proposed scheme solves directly the 1-D characteristic equations for the pressure head and the discharge using the MOC and solves the 2-D characteristic equation for the axial velocities in order to calculate the wall shear stress. If the radial velocity is needed, it can be evaluated easily by an explicit equation derived from the explicit 2-D characteristic equation. In the numerical test, the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed scheme are compared with two existing quasi-two-dimensional models using the MOC. It is shown that the proposed scheme has the same accuracy as the two quasi-2D models, but requires less computational time. Therefore, it is efficient to use the proposed scheme to simulate the 2-D water hammer flows."

The temperature transients, laser energy distribution and coagulation patterns for different laser delivery modes are demonstrated. The unique advantages of the DRBEM, such as easy adaptability to complex tumor geometries and no need to discretize the inner domain, may make it well-suited and robust approach for predicting and controlling the temperature evolution in laser-induced thermotherapy procedure."
Rule-corrected energy management strategy for hybrid electric vehicles based on operation-mode prediction,"Yonggang Liu, Jun Gao, Datong Qin, Yi Zhang, Zhenzhen Lei, ","Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 188, 1 July 2018, Pages 796-806, ","The energy crisis and exhaust emissions are serious problems that are largely related to road traffic. One solution to these threats is to switch from traditional gasoline-based vehicles to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) or electric vehicles (EVs), which also has the benefit of promoting a more sustainable economy. Energy management strategies (EMS) for HEVs or EVs play an important role in improving fuel economy. As a stochastic prediction method, a Markov chain, has been widely used in the prediction of driving conditions, but the application of a Markov chain in the prediction of HEV-operating modes in a rule-based EMS has rarely been presented in the literature. In addition, the threshold selection of rule-based EMS is usually based on experience and it is difficult to achieve optimal performance. In this paper, the impact of operation-mode prediction on rule-based EMS fuel economy has been explored to achieve real-time on-line corrections to motor and engine torque and to enhance their capacity for on-line optimization. Thus, a new EMS for HEV has been proposed based on operation-mode prediction using a Markov chain, which determines the on-line correction of torque distribution between the engine and the electric motor. The Markov decision processes and transition matrix are introduced first, and then, the transition probability matrix and torque correction model are established using the MATLAB/Simulink platform. The results of the simulation show that the proposed approach provides a 13.1% and 9.6% improvement in real fuel consumption under the New European Driving Cycle and the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule respectively, in comparison with the conventional rule-based control strategies without operation-mode prediction. The results also show that the proposed control strategy can significantly enhance the real-time optimization control performance of the EMS while maintaining the state of charge within a reasonable range."

However, the role of miR-20a in the pathology of atherosclerosis remains elusive. The present study aimed to reveal the relationship between miR-20a expression and atherosclerosis using in vitro cell model. The expression level of miR-20a was detected in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) under Ox-LDL exposure. Meanwhile, the regulatory effects of miR-20a on predicted targets (TLR4 and TXNIP) were also determined. Moreover, the levels of key proteins and inflammatory mediators in TLR4 and NLRP3 signaling were detected to further confirm the regulatory effects of miR-20a. We found that miR-20a expression was repressed under Ox-LDL condition, and both TLR4 and TXNIP acted as regulatory targets of miR-20a. Overexpressed miR-20a reduced ROS generation under Ox-LDL treatment, and this effect was restored by forced expression of TLR4. Moreover, key molecules (including MyD88, TRIF, phosphorylated NF-百B (p65), NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, ICAM-1 and IL-1汕) in TLR4 and NLRP3 signaling were significantly repressed under miR-20a overexpression. In conclusion, miR-20a could negatively regulate TLR4 and NLRP3 signaling to protect HAECs from inflammatory injuries, which provides a new insight into the inhibition of atherosclerotic development."

It is also found that the DPL bioheat conduction equations can be reduced to the Fourier heat conduction equations only if both phase lag times of the temperature gradient (而T) and the heat flux (而q) are zero. This is different from the DPL model for pure conduction materials, for which it can be reduced to the Fourier's heat conduction model provided that 而q=而T.

Desert soil bacteria deposit atmospheric carbon dioxide in carbonate precipitates,"Zhen Liu, Yuqing Zhang, Keyu Fa, Hongfei Zhao, Bin Wu, ","CATENA, Volume 170, November 2018, Pages 64-72, ","Carbonate precipitation by soil microbes has generated major concern recently because of the potential for mitigating the challenge of increasing CO2 level; however, while desert soil microbes have the capacity of carbonate formation, it is unknown if they can deposit atmospheric carbon dioxide. We isolated soil bacteria from the Mu Us Desert in northern China to perform an experiment of carbonate formation by bacteria isolated from the soil. We detected the precipitates produced by the bacteria, and identified the carbon source of the carbonate precipitates using stable carbon isotopic tracing. Six bacterial strains, designated as strains 1每6, were isolated from the desert soil, including Arthrobacter sp., Rhodococcus sp., Planococcus sp., Streptomyces sp., Arthrobacter sp., and Microbacterium sp. We confirmed that all six species precipitated carbonate (vaterite and calcite) using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray. 13CO2 labeling showed that the abundance of 13C was significantly higher in carbonate precipitates, of which 1.03% was represented by atmospheric carbon; that is, the atmospheric CO2 participates in the formation of carbonate by desert soil bacteria. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the occurrence of carbonate precipitation by these desert soil bacterial strains (strains 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6), which expands the current knowledge on carbonate-depositing bacteria in drylands. The carbon transformation process, from atmospheric CO2 to carbonate precipitates by soil bacteria, indicates a process of atmospheric CO2 deposition through microbial carbonate precipitation. Although under controlled conditions, this study provided an important insight supporting that drylands probably contribute strongly to global carbon processes via soil microbial activity."

On the fault-tolerant performance for a class of robust image steganography,"Yi Zhang, Chuan Qin, Weiming Zhang, Fenlin Liu, Xiangyang Luo, ","Signal Processing, Volume 146, May 2018, Pages 99-111, ","The mainstream adaptive steganography algorithms often cannot transmit secret messages correctly when stego images suffer from JPEG compression. In this respect, researchers proposed a series of robust adaptive steganography methods based on the framework of ※Compression-resistant Domain Constructing + RS-STC Codes§ in previous studies. However, these methods leave behind the fault tolerance analysis, resulting in potential mistakes in extracted messages, which brings uncertainty to practical application. To solve this problem, an error model based on burst errors and STCs decoding damage is given in this manuscript, utilizing the burst error model based on Poisson distribution. Then the model is verified using the hypothesis test problem judged by the 聿2 test method. Based on the proposed model, the error conditions of received stego sequence are depicted, and the fault-tolerant performance of the robust steganography based on ※Compression-resistant Domain Constructing + RS-STC Codes§ is deduced, that is, the probability lower bound for RS-STCs decoding to correctly extract embedded messages. Experiments demonstrate that the practical fault-tolerant results of previous robust steganography methods consist with the theoretical derivation results, which provides a theory support for coding parameter selection and message extraction integrity to the robust steganography based on ※Compression-resistant Domain Constructing + RS-STC Codes§."
Ultrafast solid每liquid每vapor phase change in a thin gold film irradiated by multiple femtosecond laser pulses,"Jing Huang, Yuwen Zhang, J. K. Chen, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 52, Issues 13每14, June 2009, Pages 3091-3100, ","Phase change processes including melting, vaporization and resolidification during the multiple femtosecond laser pulses irradiations on a thin gold film are investigated numerically. A two-temperature model is coupled with the phase interface track methods to describe the temperature variation and the solid每liquid and liquid每vapor interface evolutions. The relationship between the maximum vaporization temperature and melting depth, ablation depth are analyzed and compared with that of the single pulse irradiation. It is found that for two pulses irradiation, if deeper melting depth is desirable, the second pulse should be launched as soon as the melting depth induced by the first pulse reaches to the maximum. In comparison to a single pulse irradiation resulting in the same lattice temperature, this two-pulse approach leads to a greater melting depth. For laser irradiation with more than two consecutive pulses, if the total laser fluence remains a constant, larger pulse number and longer separation times between pulses leads to a smaller melting depth. However, the melting depth is much deeper compared to that by induced by a single pulse that causes the same lattice temperature."

Chen, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 52, Issues 13每14, June 2009, Pages 3137-3146, ","Bimodal packing arrangements can be used to overcome the balling phenomena in selective laser sintering (SLS). However, little attention has been paid to the effects of bimodal packing structures on radiative transfer in the SLS powder beds. In this study, a sequential addition packing algorithm is firstly employed to generate 3-D random packing of opaque, diffusively or specularly reflecting spherical particles with the same or different sizes. Then, a Monte Carlo based ray tracing algorithm is formulated, for the first time, to simulate the radiative transfer in the bimodal random packing structures composed of particles with different sizes and emissivities. The credibility of the computer code is verified with published experimental data. A comparison is also made between the calculating results and those obtained by two-flux model. By using the present algorithm, the radiative heat fluxes at both levels of particle and entire bed as well as the transmitted laser energy are statistically evaluated. The influences of bimodal size distribution and particle surface emissivity on the radiative transfer process are examined. Such information is expected to be helpful for optimizing the SLS process."
Discrete element modeling of powder flow and laser heating in direct metal laser sintering process,"Weng-Hoh Lee, Yi Zhang, Jing Zhang, ","Powder Technology, Volume 315, 15 June 2017, Pages 300-308, ","A novel particle-based discrete element model (DEM) is developed to simulate the whole Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) process, which includes simplified powder deposition, recoating, laser heating, and holding stages. This model is first validated through the simulation of particle flow and heat conduction in the powder bed, and the simulated results are in good agreement with either experiment in the literature or finite element method. Then the validated model is employed to the DMLS process. The effects of laser power, laser scan speed, and hatch spacing on the temperature distributions in the powder bed are investigated. The results demonstrate that the powder bed temperature rises as the laser power is increased. Increasing laser scan speed and laser hatch spacing will not affect the average temperature increase in the powder bed since energy input is kept same. However, a large hatch spacing may cause non-uniform temperature distribution and microstructure inhomogeneity.

Numerical results show that the decrease of density leads to decrease of the heat transfer coefficient while the increase of each thermal property leads to increase of the heat transfer coefficient. Meanwhile, Nusselt number is found to be independent of the temperature difference and can be calculated from the correlation at low temperature difference on the condition that the jet inlet temperature is selected as the qualitative temperature. Correlation proposed by earlier researcher is then modified for impingement heat transfer at high temperature difference."
Simulating the Thermal Response of Glass Under Various Shading Conditions in a Fire,"Yu Wang, Qingsong Wang, Xuebao Fan, Jinhua Sun, ","Procedia Engineering, Volume 62, 2013, Pages 702-709, ","In a fire, the thermal stress upon window glass caused by a temperature difference between exposed and shaded areas is the key factor contributing to glass fracture. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of different shaded conditions on the glass when it is exposed to fire. Eleven different shading cases were simulated using finite element method (FEM) software, called EASY, which was developed by the authors and verified accurately by theory. The glass surface temperatures, stress field, the time and location of crack initiation and crack propagation were presented. It was found that the center shaded case is a safer way to protect the glass from cracking and the four corners shaded case has greater probability of cracking. The stress and fracture models for shading glass can be applied in predicting the probability of crack initiation, the distribution variation of temperatures and the stress time history under certain thermal loads. Furthermore, practical advice to optimize the window installation design or ways of shading to protect the glass from falling out in a fire can be obtained from the results."

This paper focuses on the study of wide-sense nonblocking and strictly nonblocking Clos networks under the (f1,f2)-cast traffic, where the minimum fanout and the maximum fanout of each connection request are restricted to the values of f1 and f2, respectively. The (f1,f2)-cast is general in the sense it covers the unicast and multicast as special cases. Our study addresses the specific case in which the (f1,f2)-cast traffic loads evenly the input stage switches based on f1. We conduct analysis on the sufficient conditions for wide-sense nonblocking as well as the necessary and sufficient conditions for strictly nonblocking in such networks. Our results indicate that under (f1,f2)-cast traffic, the number of middle stage switches required in the special Clos networks can be reduced. It is expected that this study can provide a fundamental guideline to the cost efficient design of nonblocking multicast Clos networks for different applications, including, e.g., optical switching fabrics for data center environments."
A flexible distribution and its application in reliability engineering,"Yan-Gang Zhao, Xuan-Yi Zhang, Zhao-Hui Lu, ","Reliability Engineering & System Safety, Volume 176, August 2018, Pages 1-12, ","Probability distributions of random variables are necessary for reliability evaluation. Generally, probability distributions are determined using one or two parameters evaluated from the mean and standard deviation of statistical data. However, these distributions are not sufficiently flexible to represent the skewness and kurtosis of data. This study therefore proposes a probability distribution based on the cubic normal transformation, whose parameters are determined using the skewness and kurtosis, as well as the mean and standard deviation of available data. This distribution is categorized into six different types based on different combinations of skewness and kurtosis. The boundaries of each type are identified, and the completeness of each type is proved. The cubic normal distribution is demonstrated to provide significant flexibility, and its applicable range covers a large area in the skewness每kurtosis plane, thus enabling it to approximate well-known distributions. The distribution is then applied in reliability engineering: simulating distributions of statistical data, calculating fourth-moment reliability index, finding optimal inspection intervals for condition-based maintenance system, and assessing the influence of input uncertainties on the whole output of a system. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of the distribution in the above-mentioned reliability engineering practices."

Compared with TWSVM, the main advantages of this L1LTSVM classifier are: first, the dual problems of L1LTSVM do not need to inverse the kernel matrices during the learning process, indicating L1LTSVM not only has a partly sparse decision function, but also can be solved efficiently by some SVM-type learning algorithms, and then is suitable for large scale problems. Second, this L1LTSVM has more perfect and practical geometric interpretation. Experimental results on several synthetic as well as benchmark datasets indicate the significant advantage of L1LTSVM in the generalization performance."

Three configurations, including the conventional extractive distillation (CED), extractive distillation under reduced pressure (EDRP) and extractive dividing-wall column (EDWC) processes are investigated in order to obtain the optimal separation configurations. Their economic feasibilities are estimated by calculating the total annual cost (TAC). The results show that the EDRP process operating at a relatively low pressure is more economic than that operating at the lowest pressure. The TAC of the EDRP and EDWC processes can be saved by 4.88% and 11.04% respectively compared to the CED process, thus the EDWC sequence is superior to the other two processes in economic benefits. Three control strategies are proposed to investigate the controllability of the EDWC process. The results show that the improved dynamic structure can overcome large feed disturbances in flowrate and composition effectively."

A comparison of numerical results and published experimental results was presented to demonstrate that such a method provides a reasonable domain that is beneficial to molecular dynamics modeling. Afterwards, a cohesive element model along the effective simulation region was established, and then the relationship between the traction and crack opening displacement for alloys was presented. The characteristic parameters obtained from the resultant curve were utilized to embed cohesive elements, and the real-life crack propagation behavior was further mimicked through finite element analysis.

A super-Gaussian beam model that is closer to the fiber laser beam profile for welding is employed instead of a frequently-used Gaussian beam. A beam characteristic parameter identification method is proposed to identify the beam characteristic parameters such as the focal spot radius and Rayleigh length. The spatial distribution of the beam power density is reconstructed. The super-Gaussian beam model has a better goodness-of-fit index than the Gaussian beam model. Finite difference method is used to solve the heat and mass transfer model developed. Some powder particles, under the action of three types of laser beams, have evaporated before falling into the laser-induced pool. The average heating rate for the super-Gaussian beam and non-ideal Gaussian beam is lower than that of the ideal Gaussian beam. Although the heated powder distribution zone and the melted powder distribution zone on the workpiece surface for the super-Gaussian beam are larger, the maximum powder mass loss by evaporation is the smallest. The effect of the identified super-Gaussian beam and non-ideal Gaussian beam on the heat and mass transfer zone and evaporation-induced mass loss is not significantly different, except for the ideal GB."

Unconventional internalization mechanisms underlying functional delivery of antisense oligonucleotides via cationic lipoplexes and polyplexes,"Xin Ming, Katsuya Sato, Rudolph L. Juliano, ","Journal of Controlled Release, Volume 153, Issue 1, 15 July 2011, Pages 83-92, ","There is mounting interest in developing antisense and siRNA oligonucleotides into therapeutic entities; however, this potential has been limited by poor access of oligonucleotides to their pharmacological targets within cells. Transfection reagents, such as cationic lipids and polymers, are commonly utilized to improve functional delivery of nucleic acids including oligonucleotides. Cellular entry of large plasmid DNA molecules with the assistance of these polycationic carriers is mediated by some form of endocytosis; however, the mechanism for delivery of small oligonucleotide molecules has not been well established. In this study, splice-shifting oligonucleotides have been formulated into cationic lipoplexes and polyplexes, and their internalization mechanisms have been examined by using pharmacological and genetic inhibitors of endocytosis. The results showed that intercellular distribution of the oligonucleotides to the nucleus governs their pharmacological response. A mechanistic study revealed that oligonucleotides delivered by lipoplexes enter the cells partially by membrane fusion and this mechanism accounts for the functional induction of the target gene. In contrast, polyplexes are internalized by unconventional endocytosis pathways that do not require dynamin or caveolin. These studies may help rationally design novel delivery systems with superior transfection efficiency but lower toxicity.Download high-res image (284KB)Download full-size image"
"Voluntary Agreements, Flexible Regulation and CER: Analysis of Games in Developing Countries and Transition Economies","Fang Wang, Jian Li, Wen Tu, ","Procedia Engineering, Volume 174, 2017, Pages 377-384, ","In this paper, we study the implementation of environmental voluntary agreements (EVA) in developing countries and transition economies to effectively motivate firms to take corporate environmental responsibility. We uses flexible regulation (FR) as the background pressure of EVA and present a four-stage game-theory model to explore under which conditions firms will comply the law and take environmental responsibility. We find that EVA could be the equilibrium outcome as long as existence of the background pressure, and the equilibrium level of abatement could exceed the standard of legislation when the background pressure of FR is large enough or the unit cost of abatement under EVA is low enough, or the social cost of capital is low enough. We also identify that the increase of abatement level will not increase firm's abatement cost in EVA, and sometimes even be lower with the support of technology and cost-sharing assistance in EVA. In addition, we suggest that the firm can actively choose the first-best level of taking environmental responsibility before participating into EVA, which can minimize the total abatement cost."

Deep learning hybrid method for islanding detection in distributed generation,"Xiangrui Kong, Xiaoyuan Xu, Zheng Yan, Sijie Chen, Dong Han, ","Applied Energy, Volume 210, 15 January 2018, Pages 776-785, ","The increasing penetration of distributed energy brings significant uncertainty and noises to microgrid operation, which enlarge the difficulty of microgrid monitoring. For as much as the detection of islanding is prone to be interfered by grid disturbance, island detection device may make misjudgment thus causing the consequence of distributed generations (DGs) out of service. The detection device must provide with the ability to differ islanding from grid disturbance. In this paper, the concept of deep learning is introduced into the classification of islanding and grid disturbance for the first time. A novel deep learning framework is proposed to detect and classify islanding or grid disturbance. The framework is a hybrid of wavelet transformation, multi-resolution singular spectrum entropy, and deep learning architecture. As a signal processing method after wavelet transformation, multi-resolution singular spectrum entropy combines multi-resolution analysis and spectrum analysis with entropy as output, from which we can extract the intrinsic different features between islanding and grid disturbance. With the features extracted, a deep learning based algorithm is proposed to classify islanding and grid disturbance. Simulation results indicate that the method can achieve its goal while being highly accurate, so the DGs mistakenly withdrawing from power grids can be avoided."

More critically, some of these fraudulent messages deceive users and cause them incalculable loss. SMS spam control has become a crucial issue that impacts the further success of mobile networks. A number of researches have been conducted to control unwanted contents or traffic, some are based on trust and reputation mechanisms. But the literature still lacks an effective solution for SMS spam control. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an SMS spam control system named TruSMS based on trust management. It can control SMS spam from its source to destinations according to trust evaluation by analyzing spam detection behaviors and SMS traffic data. We evaluate TruSMS performance under a variety of intrusions and attacks with a prototype system implementation. The result shows that TruSMS is effective with regard to accuracy, efficiency and robustness, which imply its trustworthiness."

Cholesky factorization based online regularized and kernelized extreme learning machines with forgetting mechanism,"Xin-Ran Zhou, Chun-Sheng Wang, ","Neurocomputing, Volume 174, Part B, 22 January 2016, Pages 1147-1155, ","In this paper, we propose two alternative schemes of fast online sequential extreme learning machine (ELM) for training the single hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFN), termed as Cholesky factorization based online regularized ELM with forgetting mechanism (CF-FORELM) and Cholesky factorization based online kernelized ELM with forgetting mechanism (CF-FOKELM). First, the solutions of regularized ELM (RELM) and kernelized ELM (KELM) using the matrix Cholesky factorization are introduced; then the recursive method for calculating Cholesky factor of involved matrix in RELM and KELM is designed when RELM and KELM are applied to train SLFN online; consequently, the CF-FORELM and CF-FOKELM are obtained. The numerical simulation results show CF-FORELM demands less computational burden than Dynamic Regression ELM (DR-ELM), and CF-FOKELM also owns higher computational efficiency than both FOKELM and online sequential ELM with kernels (OS-ELMK), and CF-FORELM is less sensitive to model parameters than CF-FOKELM."
8: CONDENSATION,"Amir Faghri, Yuwen Zhang, ","Transport Phenomena in Multiphase Systems, 2006, Pages 581-677, ","Condensation occurs when a saturated or superheated vapor〞pure or multicomponent〞meets an object that has a temperature below the saturation temperature. In most applications involving the condensation of a vapor, heat is transferred to a solid wall adjacent to the vapor.

Observation and analysis of electrical structure change and diversity in thunderstorms on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,"Yajun Li, Guangshu Zhang, Yanhui Wang, Bin Wu, Jing Li, ","Atmospheric Research, Volume 194, 15 September 2017, Pages 130-141, ","A comprehensive observation on thunderstorms was conducted in the Qinghai area by using a very high frequency three-dimensional lightning mapping system and Doppler radar. The spatio-temporal evolution of the charge structure of the isolated thunderstorm was analyzed according to the developing process of thunderstorm, and the reasons for the change in charge structure diversity were studied. During the initial developing and mature stages of the thunderstorm, the charge structure was a steady negative dipole polarity, i.e., the negative charge region was above the positive charge region. Furthermore, the total number of flashes was lower during these two stages. During the thunderstorm's dissipation stage, the charge structure was varied and complicated, with a positive dipole, negative dipole, and a tripole charge structure changing and coexisting during this stage. This charge structure diversity was primarily caused by the collision and merging of two local thunderstorm cells, leading to a charge rearrangement and distribution and the formation of a new charge structure. The frequency of the negative cloud-to-ground and intracloud flashes increased sharply in the dissipation stage, reaching a maximum value. The increase in frequency of negative cloud-to-ground was mainly caused by the lower positive charge weakening during the dissipation stage. In addition, the relationship between charging regions and temperature layers was analyzed by combining sounding temperature data with the theory of a non-inductive charging mechanism."
2: THERMODYNAMICS OF MULTIPHASE SYSTEMS,"Amir Faghri, Yuwen Zhang, ","Transport Phenomena in Multiphase Systems, 2006, Pages 107-176, ","This chapter defines the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium. It describes the conditions under which equilibrium exists in thermodynamic systems. The system considered may consist of either a single phase or multiple phases and may include one or more components. In its simplest form, a system is said to be in equilibrium when its measurable properties do not change over time. There are no unbalanced driving potentials within a system in the thermodynamic equilibrium state, and the system in equilibrium experiences no change when it is isolated from its surroundings. The system is said to be at equilibrium if conditions for all types of thermodynamic equilibrium are satisfied. The equilibriums that can be encountered in a multiphase system include thermal equilibrium, mechanical equilibrium, chemical equilibrium, and phase equilibrium. For a thermodynamic system to be in equilibrium, a mathematical treatment of the combination of the first two laws of thermodynamics must ascertain that certain intensive properties are uniform throughout the system."
Synthesis of a novel humidity self-regulating material from riverbed sediment for simulating cave dwellings performance,"Jiajun Miao, Zhenzi Jing, Li Pu, Yi Zhang, ","Journal of Building Engineering, Volume 20, November 2018, Pages 15-20, ","With simulation of the cave dwellings＊ performance of warming in winter and cooling in summer, a humidity self-regulating material was first synthesized with riverbed sediment. A tough and porous building material could be obtained under hydrothermal conditions, and tobermorite formation during hydrothermal process was found to have a capability of improving both strength and porosity of the specimens. The solidified sediment specimens with the molar ratios of CaO to SiO2 (C/S) of 0.4 and 0.8 could enhance the moisture adsorption/desorption capacity evidently. With extra sepiolite addition, the moisture adsorption/desorption and humidity regulating capacities could be further improved due to the coexistence of tobermorite and sepiolite. For example with extra 30 mass% sepiolite addition, the amount of moisture adsorption/desorption increased nearly two times and the RH variation decreased by a factor of two comparable to that of without sepiolite addition. As such, the hydrothermally solidified riverbed sediment can be used as the ※cave-dwelling§ construction materials (humidity regulating materials) in cities to both improve the comfort and save energy and resources."
Identification and genetic analysis of multiple P chromosomes of Agropyron cristatum in the background of common wheat,"Hong-xin CHEN, Hai-ming HAN, Qing-feng LI, Jin-peng ZHANG, Li-hui LI, ","Journal of Integrative Agriculture, Volume 17, Issue 8, August 2018, Pages 1697-1705, ","Agropyron cristatum, a wild relative of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), provides many desirable genetic resources for wheat improvement, such as tolerance to cold, drought, and disease. To transfer and utilize these desirable genes, in this study, two wheat-A. cristatum derivatives II-13 and II-23 were identified and analyzed. We found that the number of root tip cell chromosomes was 44 in both II-13 and II-23, but there were four and six P genome chromosomes in II-13 and II-23, respectively, based on genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). The chromosome configurations of II-13 and II-23 were both 2n=22II by the meiotic analysis of pollen mother cells (PMCs) at metaphase I, indicating that there were two and three pairs of P chromosomes in II-13 and II-23, respectively. Notably, wheat chromosome 7D was absent in derivative line II-13 while II-23 lacked chromosomes 4B and 7A based on SSR analysis combining fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with pAs1 and pSc119.2 as probes. Chromosomes 2P and 7P were detected in both II-13 and II-23. Another pair of P genome chromosomes in II-23 was determined to be 4P based on expressed-sequences tags-sequence tagged sites (EST-STS) markers specific to A. cristatum and FISH with probes pAcTRT1 and pAcpCR2. Overall, these results suggest that II-13 was a 7P (7D) substitution line with one pair of additional 2P chromosomes and II-23 was a multiple 4P (4B), 7P (7A) substitution line with one pair of additional 2P chromosomes. Moreover, we obtained six alien disomic addition lines and five alien disomic substitution lines by backcrossing. These new materials will allow desirable genes from A. cristatum to be used in common wheat."
Horizontal shaking table tests on structures using innovative earthquake mitigation devices,"Zhao-Dong Xu, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, Volume 325, Issues 1每2, 7 August 2009, Pages 34-48, ","Viscoelastic (VE) devices have been widely used to mitigate the dynamic responses of the structures resulting from the earthquake or the strong wind for more than 20 years. These devices are usually installed in the upper portion of the structures to reduce the vibration responses. Few devices, however, are attempted to mitigate and isolate multidimensional vibration energy at the same time. In this paper, an innovative device, multidimensional earthquake isolation and mitigation device (MEIMD), is proposed, which can perform its ※name-giving§ task of earthquake isolation and earthquake mitigation simultaneously.

Firstly, shaking table tests on steel frame structures with and without the devices are carried out. Secondly, based on the recorded data of the acceleration and displacement responses of the tested structures, the analysis of dynamic characteristics is performed. Finally, a comparison between the finite element analytical and experimental results for the test structure is presented. All of results, on the one hand, illustrate that the finite element numerical results are accordant with the experimental results; on the other hand, they demonstrate that the devices not only have remarkable earthquake isolation action but also have fine mitigation effect in horizontal direction."

In this study, the alone or combined effects of chitosan and salicylic acid on the control of green mold decay in grapefruit fruits were investigated. The results showed that combination of chitosan with SA treatment provided a more effective control of green mold than alone applying chitosan or SA. chitosan plus SA significantly reduced lesion diameter, disease incidence, while the content of endogenous SA much higher than those in treatment alone or control fruit. The combined treatment enhanced the chitinase, 汕-1,3-glucanase, peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and polyphenoloxidase activities and stimulated the synthesis of total phenolic compounds content. Moreover, the applications of alone or combined did not impair fruit postharvest quality such as firmness, weight loss and TA, while increased ascorbic acid and total soluble solids contents in grapefruit fruits. These result suggest that the use of chitosan combined SA treatment was effective in activating disease resistance against green mold, and providing a longer storage life with acceptable postharvest quality in grapefruit fruit."
1: INTRODUCTION TO TRANSPORT PHENOMENA,"Amir Faghri, Yuwen Zhang, ","Transport Phenomena in Multiphase Systems, 2006, Pages 1-106, ","Multiphase transport phenomena must be considered in the design and optimization of many engineering systems such as heat exchangers, heat pipes, cooling devices for electronics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, food processing equipment, and fuel cells.

The presence of multiple phases within a single system may alter the systems' performance characteristics in terms of the pressure drop that determines a flowing system's power requirements, the heat transfer rates that control its capacity, and the flow stability that in turn affects its operational characteristics. The presence of multiple phases makes systems more complicated and affects reliability.

The effects of K2ZrF6, EDTA-Na, voltage and their interactions on the microstructure and corrosion resistance of these coatings were investigated based on orthogonal experimental design. The thicknesses, phase compositions and morphologies of the coatings were analyzed by using TT260 eddy-current coating thickness measurement gauge, XRD and SEM, respectively. The amount of micro-pores and the porosity on the coating surface were counted quantitatively by Image J software. The electrochemical test was used to evaluate the corrosion resistances of the coatings. The results show that bringing interactions among each factor into the experimental design is the key to this study. And the coating can be remarkably affected not only by the separate functiont of K2ZrF6, EDTA-Na and voltage, but also their interaction. The interaction among K2ZrF6, EDTA-Na and voltage increases the content of the generated substances and inhibits the ejection of these substances out of the discharge channel, which improves the compactness and the thickness of the coatings as well as the content of the corrosion-resistant phase. Therefore, when high concentration of K2ZrF6 and EDTA-Na combines with high voltage, the obtained coating exhibits the optimum comprehensive properties."

HyTest: Platform for Structural Hybrid Simulations with Finite Element Model Updating,"Ge Yang, Bin Wu, Ge Ou, Zhen Wang, Shirley Dyke, ","Advances in Engineering Software, Volume 112, October 2017, Pages 200-210, ","Hybrid simulation has been demonstrated to be a powerful method to evaluate the system-level dynamic performance of structure. With the numerical substructure analyzed with finite element software and the difficult-to-model components tested with an experimental substructure, complex structures with sophisticated behaviors can readily be examined through a hybrid simulation. To coordinate and synchronize the substructures in hybrid simulation, software is required. In recent studies, model updating has been integrated into hybrid simulation to improve testing accuracy by updating the numerical model during the analysis. However, online model updating scheme requires some modifications in the typical hybrid simulation testing procedure, and this greater complexity is entailed in its implementation regarding the collaboration of identification algorithms with existing hybrid simulation software. To address this issue and broaden the utilization of hybrid simulation with model updating, an existing platform named HyTest originally for conventional hybrid simulation is extended for this purpose. This version of HyTest facilitates the online identification of material constitutive parameters using experimental measurements in its finite element based identification module. It also includes a data center with a uniform data transmission protocol to incorporate different substructures and modules. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the online identification of material parameters for concrete and steel models in a reinforced column, and to verify the accuracy of the identification module. Lastly the effectiveness of HyTest in conducting hybrid simulation with model updating is validated using actual hybrid tests on a steel frame."

Then, a simple method for estimating the wetted area on the substrate through image processing was developed. Visual analysis of the surface wetting was also conducted, and three types of wetting patterns are discussed. Experimental results on the static contact angle and contact angle hysteresis suggest that the ionic liquid solution is mostly wetting, and the aluminum surface is slightly to moderately rough. It was found that the wettability of the ionic liquid solution increases as the ionic liquid mass fraction increases. The wetting hysteresis phenomenon and the factors contributing to its occurrence were also clarified.

Previous studies have revealed the feedback regulation of the prothoracic gland (PG) activity to affect the hormone synthesis. However, the molecular regulatory mechanism of the ecdysone degradation is still unclear. In this study, we showed that ecdysone oxidase (EO) gene encoding a hormone metabolism enzyme was also induced by hormone itself in the domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori. Furthermore, luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that ecdysone inducible transcription factor E74A could bind to the cis-regulatory elements of the EO gene. Then, down-regulating the expression of the E74A by RNA interference (RNAi) decreased the expression of the EO gene and caused a higher ecdysone titer compared with the control. Thus, our results demonstrated a new feedback regulation degradation (EO) pathway controlled by ecdysone itself through transcription factor E74A, expanding the knowledge about the regulatory system that determines the formation of ecdysone pulse."

It is found that the significant changes in reflectivity and absorption coefficient due to rapid temperature rise could drastically alter laser energy deposition and in turn, the thermal response in metal films. It is also found that the semi-classical 2T model could predict lower electron and lattice temperature and less severe solid每liquid and liquid每vapor phase change than the classical 2T model.

Modeling of IPMC Cantilever's Displacements and Blocking Forces,"David Vokoun, Qingsong He, Ludek Heller, Min Yu, Zhendong Dai, ","Journal of Bionic Engineering, Volume 12, Issue 1, January 2015, Pages 142-151, ","The motion of an Ionic Polymer Metal Composite (IPMC) cantilever under a periodic voltage control is modeled. In our finite element 3D model, we follow both the free tip displacements and the blocking forces for various thicknesses and elastic constants of the ionomer membrane. It turns out that the maximum displacement of the free tip strongly depends on the value of the Young's modulus of the electrodes. Furthermore, the maximum blocking force, Fmax, increases with the thickness of the ionomer membrane. At constant values of Young's moduli of the electrodes and ionomer membrane thickness, if the Young's modulus of the ionomer membrane varies within the range from 0.2 MPa to 1 GPa, the change of Fmax is less than 10 %. The simulated maximal displacements, blocking forces and electrical currents are compared with the corresponding sets of experimental data, respectively. Qualitative agreement between the simulated and the respective measured data profiles is obtained. Furthermore, it is found that the assumption of electrostatic interactions in the cation depleted region of the ionomer membrane has a negligible effect. The advantage of the model consists in its simplicity."

Evolution of the effective permeability for transient and pore-scale two-phase flow in real porous media,"San Zhang, Yi Zhang, Bo Wang, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 113, October 2017, Pages 1093-1105, ","Permeability is one of the key parameters to model and predict the infiltration or transport process of fluid through a porous media. However, most models and approaches that have been developed experimentally, theoretically or numerically to determine the saturated permeability for steady flow are indirect or based on predefined or virtual porous media models. To the best of our knowledge, the variation behavior of the effective permeability with the infiltration length or time in unsaturated flow based on a real porous media has rarely been considered and is little understood. Herein, we propose a simple numerical method of modelling the infiltration processes of a liquid though a porous media preform based on a real porous media obtained from an experimental scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image and validate it by comparing the simulated results with experimental data. Then, we calculate the unsaturated permeability using Darcy＊s law based on the results of numerical simulation without any structural parameters of porous media. The evolution of the effective permeability with the time or flow front is then presented, and the relationship between the saturation degree and permeability is also considered. The numerical results indicate that (i) the maximum infiltration length along the macroscopic flow direction globally characterizes the variations of the flow front better than the other parameters; (ii) the effective permeability of an unsaturated porous media decreases exponentially with time and the advancing of the flow front and decreases with the degree of saturation following a power-law trend; and (iii) the saturation evolution may have great effects on the effective permeability of a liquid through a porous media."

Finite time control of switched stochastic nonlinear systems,"Fang Wang, Bing Chen, Yumei Sun, Chong Lin, ","Fuzzy Sets and Systems, In press, corrected proof, Available online 27 April 2018, ","This manuscript studies a finite-time tracking problem of switched stochastic nonlinear uncertain systems. By utilizing a comparison theorem and a mean value theorem of integrals, a significant finite-time stability criterion for stochastic nonlinear systems is first set up. Then, combining a common Lyapunov function method and an adaptive fuzzy control approach, a novel common control scheme is formed. Under the proposed adaptive mechanism, the system performance is achieved in finite-time. By using the universal approximation ability, the nonlinear functions and their bounding functions may be completely unknown to the designer, which is more in line with reality than the existing finite-time researches for stochastic nonlinear systems."

4: GENERALIZED GOVERNING EQUATIONS FOR MULTIPHASE SYSTEMS: AVERAGING FORMULATIONS,"Amir Faghri, Yuwen Zhang, ","Transport Phenomena in Multiphase Systems, 2006, Pages 238-330, ","The objectives of various averaging methods are twofold: (1) to define the average properties for the multiphase system and correlate the experimental data and (2) to obtain solvable governing equations that can be used to predict the macroscopic properties of the multiphase system. This chapter discusses the application of averaging methods to governing equations. Based on the physical concepts used to formulate multiphase transport phenomena, the averaging methods can be classified into three major groups: (1) Eulerian averaging, (2) Lagrangian averaging, and (3) molecular statistical averaging. The chapter reviews these averaging techniques. The development of the Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM) method has the potential to be useful in computational flow modeling of multiphase systems. The LBM method must have the capability of conserving energy to make it a useful model for practical applications because many multiphase systems utilize the latent heat associated with phase change."
Two Schemes of Privacy-Preserving Trust Evaluation,"Zheng Yan, Wenxiu Ding, Valtteri Niemi, Athanasios V. Vasilakos, ","Future Generation Computer Systems, Volume 62, September 2016, Pages 175-189, ","Trust evaluation computes trust values by collecting and processing trust evidence. It plays an important role in trust management that automatically ensures trust relationships among system entities and enhances system security. But trust evidence collection and process may cause privacy leakage, which makes involved entities reluctant to provide personal evidence that is essential for trust evaluation. Current literature pays little attention to Privacy-Preserving Trust Evaluation (PPTE). Existing work still has many limitations, especially on generality, efficiency and reliability. In this paper, we propose two practical schemes to guard privacy of trust evidence providers based on additive homomorphic encryption in order to support a traditional class of trust evaluation that contains evidence summation. The first scheme achieves better computational efficiency, while the second one provides greater security at the expense of a higher computational cost. Accordingly, two trust evaluation algorithms are further proposed to flexibly support different application cases. Specifically, these algorithms can overcome attacks raised by internal malicious evidence providers to some extent even though the trust evaluation is partially performed in an encrypted form. Extensive analysis and performance evaluation show the security and effectivity of our schemes for potential application prospect and their efficiency to support big data process."

In this paper, research on the elasticity of natural gas demand is surveyed, and it is found that the price and income elasticities of natural gas demand in different sectors are distinctive. In particular, this paper constructs an autoregressive distribution lag model to study the elasticity of natural gas demand in various sectors of China. The results show that, except for the residents sector, the long-run price elasticity of natural gas demand in other sectors is greater than 0, which is contrary to the estimates of developed countries. The demand for natural gas is complementary to coal in industrial and power generation sectors, which is also different from developed countries. The elasticity of natural gas demand in residents sector is lack in price elasticity but abundant in income elasticity, which is similar to the developed countries. The results also shows that natural gas and oil are substitutes for each other in the transportation sector, and natural gas and coal are substitutes for each other in service sector."

When ice is exposed to moist air with a partial pressure of water below its triple point pressure, heating of the ice will result in a phase change from ice directly to vapor without first going through the liquid phase. Spacecrafts and space suits can reject heat by sublimating ice into the vacuum of space. An application for the sublimation of ice is the preparation of specimens using freeze-drying for a scanning electronic microscope (SEM) or a transmission electronic microscope (TEM). This type of phase change is referred to as ※sublimation.§ The opposite process is deposition, which describes the process of vapor changing directly to solid without going through condensation and freezing."
A twin projection support vector machine for data regression,"Xinjun Peng, Dong Xu, Jindong Shen, ","Neurocomputing, Volume 138, 22 August 2014, Pages 131-141, ","In this paper, an efficient twin projection support vector regression (TPSVR) algorithm for data regression is proposed. This TPSVR determines indirectly the regression function through a pair of nonparallel up- and down-bound functions solved by two smaller sized support vector machine (SVM)-type problems. In each optimization problem of TPSVR, it seeks a projection axis such that the variance of the projected points is minimized by introducing a new term, which makes it not only minimize the empirical variance of the projected inputs, but also maximize the empirical correlation coefficient between the up- or down-bound targets and the projected inputs. In terms of generalization performance, the experimental results indicate that TPSVR not only obtains the better and stabler prediction performance than the classical SVR and some other algorithms, but also needs less number of support vectors (SVs) than the classical SVR."
11: TWO-PHASE FLOW AND HEAT TRANSFER,"Amir Faghri, Yuwen Zhang, ","Transport Phenomena in Multiphase Systems, 2006, Pages 853-949, ","Two-phase flow refers to the interactive flow of two distinct phases〞each phase representing a mass or volume of matter〞with common interfaces in a channel.

Coordinated parameter design of power system stabilizers and static synchronous compensator using gradual hybrid differential evaluation,"Sheng-Kuan Wang, ","International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems, Volume 81, October 2016, Pages 165-174, ","In this study, the damping scale function is used as an objective function to coordinate power system stabilizers and a static synchronous compensator with damping stabilizer parameters under various power system operating conditions to address high-frequency oscillation problems. The gradual hybrid differential evaluation algorithm developed in this study employs the gradual search method on the hybrid differential evaluation to enhance the probability of finding an optimal solution. A 16-machine power system is used to estimate the feasibility of the proposed objective function and algorithm. In the test system, all machines have stabilizers installed, and a static synchronous compensator with a damping stabilizer is placed on bus 17. The input signals of the damping stabilizer and power system stabilizers include local and remote voltage or speed deviation signals, respectively.

Simultaneous dispersive and covalent monolayer MoS2/TiO2 cluster heterostructures: Insights into their enhanced photocatalytic activity,"Gui-Fang Wang, Wei-Qing Huang, Wangyu Hu, Ping Peng, Gui-Fang Huang, ","Superlattices and Microstructures, Volume 121, September 2018, Pages 64-74, ","Tuning electron transfer at interface, largely depending upon interfacial interaction, is paramount to rationally designing nanoscale heterostructures with desirable performance for future electronics, optoelectronics, and solar energy conversion. Here, we explore the interfacial interaction between monolayer MoS2 and TiO2 cluster to elucidate the mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic activity of their hybrids. It is firstly revealed that both dispersive (van der Waals forces) and covalent interactions can simultaneously exist in the monolayer MoS2/TiO2 cluster heterostructures, which depends on their relative orientations. The Ti-S and O=S bonds in covalently bonded heterostructures and flat bands in noncovalent heterostructures lead to an effective separation of photoexcited charge carriers between two constituents, therefore enhanced photocatalytic activity. The small band gap enables the MoS2/TiO2 cluster heterostructures having strong optical absorption in the whole visible light. Moreover, the Mo and S atoms at basal plane, which are catalytically inert, turn into catalytic active sites, making the monolayer MoS2 to be a highly active co-catalyst. These findings disclose the elusive microscopic mechanism behind the enhanced photocatalytic activity of MoS2/TiO2 hybrids, and provide a systematic step towards a better understanding of interfacial interaction in layered MoS2-based heterostructures."

LRFN (leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein) recognizes bacteria and promotes hemocytic phagocytosis in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas,"Qingsong Huang, Mingjia Yu, Hongmei Chen, Manhong Zeng, Dongbo Chen, ","Fish & Shellfish Immunology, Volume 72, January 2018, Pages 622-628, ","In bivalve mollusks, circulating hemocyte mediated phagocytosis is one of the primary ways to eliminate invading microbes. Here, we have identified one CgLRFN (leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein) in the Crassostrea gigas as a novel transmembrane LRR (Leucine-rich repeat) domain containing protein in C. gigas, homologous to the jawless fish VLR protein, that plays an important role in recognizing bacteria and promoting hemocytic phagocytosis. Tissue distribution analysis of CgLRFN in Pacific oyster showed that it is widely expressed in various tissues like the gills, adductor muscles, digestive glands, gonads, heart and in the hemocytes. Furthermore, infection of Pacific oysters with two marine Vibrio strains V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus was found to significantly increase CgLRFN expression in the hemocytes. Analysis of subcellular localization showed that CgLRFN is primarily localized in the cell membrane. Additionally, CgLRFN was found to be able to bind both the bacterial strains, indicating its possible role as a cell surface receptor. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that CgLRFN coated bacteria was phagocytosed by oyster hemocytes at a significantly higher rate compared to the uncoated bacteria. Finally, RNAi mediated knockdown of CgLRFN in vivo resulted in reduced clearance of both the bacterial strains from the oyster hemolymph. Overall, our study demonstrates that CgLRFN acts as a pattern recognition receptor for Vibrio spp. and promotes hemocytic phagocytosis in the Pacific oyster, which is critical for understanding the mechanism of bacterial infection in lower invertebrates, and also contributes to disease management of this economically and ecologically important marine mollusk.Download high-res image (158KB)Download full-size image"

The neural networks are affected by uncertain parameters whose values are time-invariant and unknown, but bounded in given compact sets. Several new sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic/exponential robust stability of the interval delayed neural networks are derived. The results can be casted as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are shown to be generalizations of some existing conditions. Compared with most existing results, the presented conditions are less conservative and easier to check. Two illustrative numerical examples are given to substantiate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed robust stability analysis method."

The processing did not involve any strong acid treatment and thus effectively preserved the excellent electronic properties associated with MWCNT. The as-obtained MWCNT/Nafion-IPMC actuator was tested in terms of conductivity, bulk and surface morphology, blocking force and electric current. It was shown that the blocking force and the current of the new IPMC are 2.4 times and 1.67 times higher compared with a pure Nafion-based IPMC. Moreover, the MWCNT/IPMC performance is much better than previously reported Nafion-IPMC doped by acid-treated MWCNT. Such significantly improved performance should be attributed to the improvement of electrical property associated with the addition of MWCNTs without acid treatment."

The lure of antagonistic social strategy in unstable socioecological environment: Residential mobility facilitates individuals' antisocial behavior,"Shijiang Zuo, Niwen Huang, Pan Cai, Fang Wang, ","Evolution and Human Behavior, Volume 39, Issue 3, May 2018, Pages 364-371, ","Individuals are believed to calibrate their antisocial level in response to the socioecological environment where they live. However, knowledge of the relationship between specific socioecological factors and antisocial behavior remains scant. This research focused on humans' residential mobility and explored its influence on antisocial behavior. Three studies were designed to test the hypothesis that individuals with high (vs. low) residential mobility tend to engage in antisocial behavior more frequently. The results showed that both self-reported residential mobility (Study 1) and manipulated residential mobility (Studies 2 and 3) positively predicted individuals' antisocial level. Furthermore, we found that social monitoring played a role in moderating the linkage between residential mobility and antisocial behavior (Study 3); individuals with high residential mobility decreased their antisocial behavior when they were observed by artificial eyes, while individuals with low residential mobility did the opposite. Taken together, this research suggests that, generally speaking, residential mobility is one socioecological factor that increases antisocial behavior, and that social monitoring can have diverse effects on such behavior."

Refining androstenedione and bisnorcholenaldehyde from mother liquor of phytosterol fermentation using macroporous resin column chromatography followed by crystallization,"Shi-Dong Xu, Fang-Hong Ning, Bang-he Jiang, Huan-Xin Xu, Zuo-Zhen Liu, ","Journal of Chromatography B, Volume 1079, 15 March 2018, Pages 9-14, ","Androstenedione is an androgen and intermediate in the biosynthesis of most adrenocortical, anabolic, sex and synthetic steroids, such as canrenone, eplerenone, norethindrone and spironolactone. Bisnorcholenaldehyde is an important intermediate in the synthesis of progesterone. This study established an androstenedione and bisnorcholenaldehyde separation method that used a macroporous adsorption resin and an ethanol-water mixture as eluent. The adsorption properties of 12 non-polar or weakly polar macroporous adsorption resins were compared, and three resins exhibited a high adsorption capacity and high desorption rate for both androstenedione and bisnorcholenaldehyde. The three resins were then compared using column chromatography, and one resin was selected and parameters (flow rate, resin size, ethanol concentration and volume) of chromatography were optimized to obtain high purity and recovery. Chromatography eluate was concentrated, dissolved in suitable solvent and crystallized at an optimal temperature to obtain a high purity of both androstenedione and bisnorcholenaldehyde from the same starting material. The levels of androstenedione and bisnorcholenaldehyde in the raw material were 39.78% and 19.15%, respectively. After preparative separation and enrichment by resin column chromatography and crystallization, the purity of androstenedione and bisnorcholenaldehyde was 94.3% and 98.6%, respectively, with their recovery yields of 66.8% and 57.9%, respectively. In addition, the resin maintained over 90% separation efficiency for 5 cycles of adsorption. These results indicated that the combination of macroporous resin chromatography followed by crystallization provide a simple, effective, environmentally friendly and low-cost method for the simultaneous purification of androstenedione and bisnorcholenaldehyde."
10: BOILING,"Amir Faghri, Yuwen Zhang, ","Transport Phenomena in Multiphase Systems, 2006, Pages 765-852, ","Boiling can be distinguished as pool boiling and flow or forced convective boiling. In pool boiling, the bulk liquid is quiescent while the liquid near the heating surface moves due to free convection and the mixing induced by bubble growth and detachment. In flow or forced convective boiling, bulk liquid motion driven by some external means is superimposed on the motion that also occurs in pool boiling. This chapter presents the pool boiling curve and the various regimes of which it is composed. It discusses nucleate boiling〞including nucleation〞bubble dynamics and detachment, nucleation side density, numerical simulation of bubble growth and merger, and heat transfer analysis. The chapter also provides an overview of film boiling, including film boiling laminar boundary layer analysis and correlations, direct numerical simulations, and leidenfrost phenomenon."
Experimental evidence of large complete bandgaps in zig-zag lattice structures,"Cheng-Lin Yang, Sheng-Dong Zhao, Yue-Sheng Wang, ","Ultrasonics, Volume 74, February 2017, Pages 99-105, ","In this paper, experimental evidence of large complete bandgaps in a kind of light-weighted zig-zag lattice structure (ZLS) is presented. Ultrasonic experiments are conducted on the stainless steel slab designed with ZLS to detect the complete bandgaps. Also, the numerical simulations of the experiments by the finite element method are carried out. For comparison, we conduct the same experiments and numerical simulations on the stainless steel slab with straight lattice structure (SLS). Good agreement is obtained between the experimental and numerical results. The complete bandgaps of ZLS are successfully tested and no complete bandgap is found in SLS. The band structures and vibration modes of both ZLS and SLS are calculated via the finite element method to understand the experimental data. The effects of the geometry parameters of ZLS on the complete bandgaps are discussed in detail."
Integrated Guidance and Control of Missiles with 牟-D Method,"Ming Xin, S. N. Balakrishnan, Ernest J. Ohlmeyer, ","IFAC Proceedings Volumes, Volume 37, Issue 6, June 2004, Pages 629-634, ","Optimal formulations allow designers to bring together concerns about guidance laws and autopilot responses under one unified framework.

Missile guidance law design and autopilot are formulated into a single unified state space. The cost function is chosen to reflect both guidance and control concerns. The ultimate control input is the missile fin deflections. A new suboptimal control method, called the 牟-D method, gets an approximate closed-form solution to this nonlinear guidance problem based on approximations to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.

The roles of long period stacking ordered structure and Zn solute in the hot deformation behavior of Mg-Gd-Zn alloys,"Yun Li, Wenlong Xiao, Fang Wang, Tong Hu, Chaoli Ma, ","Journal of Alloys and Compounds, Volume 745, 15 May 2018, Pages 33-43, ","In order to investigate the roles of long period stacking ordered (LPSO) structure and Zn solute in the hot deformation behavior of Mg-Gd-Zn alloys, the Mg-12Gd-1Zn-1Mn-0.5Zr alloy containing LPSO phase or Zn solute was hot compressed under various deformation conditions in comparison with the Zn-free Mg-12Gd-1Mn-0.5Zr alloy. The results showed that the Zn-containing alloys had stronger softening effects, larger peak stress and higher average activation energy than the Zn-free one within the safe deformation domain. Both LPSO phase and Zn solute in 汐-Mg matrix increased the efficiency of power dissipation, narrowed down the flow stability regions of processing map and impeded the dynamic recrystallization (DRX), especially when Zn solute was mainly in 汐-Mg matrix. Furthermore, the LPSO phase or Zn solute in 汐-Mg matrix promoted the dynamic precipitation. A few Mg5Gd particles can be observed in the Zn-free alloy, while a large number of stacking faults (SFs) and LPSO phase were precipitated in the Zn-containing alloys, and they were eventually transformed into Mg5Gd particles at low strain rate.Download high-res image (343KB)Download full-size image"

Cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor functions as a pattern recognition receptor in anti-bacterial immunity of Marsupenaeus japonicus,"Ke-Yi Zhang, Wen-Jie Yuan, Ji-Dong Xu, Jin-Xing Wang, ","Developmental & Comparative Immunology, Volume 89, December 2018, Pages 122-130, ","The cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) is a member of the P-type lectin family. As a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, it functions in the delivery of newly synthesized acid hydrolases from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes for their subsequent transfer to the lysosome by binding the mannose-6-phosphate receptor-recognition moieties in the hydrolases. However, the functions of CD-MPR in immune responses are seldom reported. In the present study, we identified a CD-MPR-like molecule in Marsupenaeus japonicus and designed it as MjCD-MPR. It was significantly upregulated after challenge with Vibrio anguillarum at the mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of MjCD-MPR resulted in a significant increase in the amount of V. anguillarum in the hemolymph of shrimp, which suggested that MjCD-MPR plays a role in shrimp antibacterial defense. The recombinant extracytoplasmic region of MjCD-MPR could bind gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by interaction with peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, and lipoteichoic acid. MjCD-MPR showed no direct bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal activity. Knockdown of MjCD-MPR decreased the expression levels of several antimicrobial peptides (Alf-C1, Alf-E1, Crustin I-2, and Crustin I-3), suggesting that MjCD-MPR promotes the expression of antimicrobial peptides in shrimp. In summary, working as a pattern recognition receptor, MjCD-MPR recognizes invading bacteria and triggers the expression of AMPs against bacterial infection in shrimp."
A collective neurodynamic optimization approach to bound-constrained nonconvex optimization,"Zheng Yan, Jun Wang, Guocheng Li, ","Neural Networks, Volume 55, July 2014, Pages 20-29, ","This paper presents a novel collective neurodynamic optimization method for solving nonconvex optimization problems with bound constraints. First, it is proved that a one-layer projection neural network has a property that its equilibria are in one-to-one correspondence with the Karush每Kuhn每Tucker points of the constrained optimization problem. Next, a collective neurodynamic optimization approach is developed by utilizing a group of recurrent neural networks in framework of particle swarm optimization by emulating the paradigm of brainstorming. Each recurrent neural network carries out precise constrained local search according to its own neurodynamic equations. By iteratively improving the solution quality of each recurrent neural network using the information of locally best known solution and globally best known solution, the group can obtain the global optimal solution to a nonconvex optimization problem. The advantages of the proposed collective neurodynamic optimization approach over evolutionary approaches lie in its constraint handling ability and real-time computational efficiency. The effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed approach are illustrated by using many multimodal benchmark functions."

Reflection and transmission coefficients of the SH0 mode in the adhesive structures with imperfect interface,"Juncai Ding, Bin Wu, Cunfu He, ","Ultrasonics, Volume 70, August 2016, Pages 248-257, ","Compared with body waves, ultrasonic guided waves can provide more local characteristic information about the interface in the defect detection of adhesive structures. In the paper, the expressions of the reflection and transmission coefficients of the lowest SH mode (SH0) in multilayered plate-like adhesive structure were deduced on the basis of wave propagation controlling equations and tangential stiffness coefficient KT was contained in the expressions. Then, the expressions were compared with the previous results to verify their applicability and correctness. Then, aluminum/epoxy resin/aluminum adhesive structures were used to explore the effects of the changes in incident angle, frequency-thickness product and tangential stiffness coefficient on SH wave propagation characteristics in adhesive structures with different interface quality (perfect, weak bonding, and slip/debonding interfaces). The results showed that the propagation mode of SH wave in adhesive structures was mainly determined by the incident angle, frequency, adhesive layer thickness and tangential stiffness coefficient. With the increase in the frequency-thickness product, multi-order resonance is generated in the reflection and transmission coefficient curves of SH wave under the perfect and weak bonding interfaces. If proper values of the incident angle of acoustic waves and frequency-thickness product are selected, the perfect, weak bonding, and slip/debonding interfaces can be differentiated from each other, but the slip and debonding interfaces cannot be distinguished from each other. The study provides theoretical contribution to the detection of multilayered plate-like adhesive structure by SH wave."

Role of basolateral efflux transporter MRP4 in the intestinal absorption of the antiviral drug adefovir dipivoxil,"Xin Ming, Dhiren R. Thakker, ","Biochemical Pharmacology, Volume 79, Issue 3, 1 February 2010, Pages 455-462, ","Adefovir dipivoxil is a diester prodrug of the antiviral drug adefovir, with much greater oral bioavailability than adefovir. Evidence shows that the prodrug is metabolized to adefovir in the enterocytes during intestinal absorption. However, it is unknown how the highly charged and hydrophilic adefovir crosses the basolateral membrane in the intestine. This study determines the role of specific basolateral transporter(s) in the egress of adefovir across the basolateral membrane when formed from adefovir dipivoxil in Caco-2 cells, a model for intestinal epithelium. Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4) plays an important role in renal secretion of adefovir. Immunofluorescence images showed that MRP4 is localized in the basolateral membrane of Caco-2 cells. This localization was further confirmed by Western blotting of the apical and basolateral membrane fractions that were isolated by a novel method involving biotinylation of respective membrane proteins and affinity enrichment. MRP4-knockdown Caco-2 cells were produced by stable transfection with MRP4-specific siRNA expression plasmid. These cells showed reduced MRP4 protein expression and corresponding reduction in the basolateral egress of adefovir when adefovir dipivoxil was dosed on the apical side. A comparison of these data with the reduction in the basolateral egress of adefovir by the general MRP inhibitor indomethacin established that MRP4, among MRPs, plays a predominant role in the basolateral egress of adefovir in Caco-2 cells. The results highlight the importance of MRP4 in oral absorption of adefovir dipivoxil, and suggest that significant drug每drug interactions can occur if an MRP4 inhibitor is co-administered with adefovir dipivoxil."

To identify risk factors for mortality and failure of left atrioventricular valve repair and to determine the impact of cleft closure on postoperative atrioventricular valve function, we retrospectively analyzed hospital records of 203 patients between January 1974 and January 1995. Overall early mortality was 7.9%. Operative mortality decreased significantly over the period of the study from 19% (4/21) before 1980 to 3% (2/67) after 1990 ( p = 0.03). Ten-year survival including operative mortality was 91.3% ㊣0.004% (95% confidence limit): all survivors are in New York Heart Association class I or II. Preoperative atrioventricular valve regurgitation was assessed in 203 patients by angiography or echocardiography and was trivial or mild in 103 (52%), moderate in 82 (41%), and severe in 18 (8%). Left atrioventricular valve cleft was closed in 93% (189/203) but left alone when valve leaflet tissue was inadequate and closure of the cleft might cause significant stenosis. Reoperation for severe postoperative left atrioventricular valve regurgitation was necessary in eight patients, five of whom initially did not have closure of the cleft and three of whom had cleft closure. Six patients had reoperation with annuloplasty and two patients required left atrioventricular valve replacement. Five patients survived reoperation and are currently in New York Heart Association class I or II. On most recent evaluation assessed by angiography or echocardiography (a mean of 59 months after repair), left atrioventricular valve regurgitation was trivial or mild in 137 of the 146 survivors (94%) examined; none had moderate or severe left atrioventricular valve stenosis. By multiple logistic regression analysis, strong risk factors for early death and need for reoperation included postoperative pulmonary hypertensive crisis, immediate postoperative severe left atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and double-orifice left atrioventricular valve. These results indicate that complete atrioventricular septal defects can be repaired with low mortality and good intermediate to long-term results. Routine approximation of the cleft is safe and has a low incidence of reoperation for left atrioventricular valve regurgitation. (J THORAC CARDIOVASC SURG 1995;110:1543-54)"

Response surface methodology was adopted to explore the relationships between the structure paramerters of core (contact radius and height of the cone) and magnetic field intensity based on finite element analysis. The analysis results showed that the contact radius and cone height of the core had important influences on magnetic field intensity. The influence of the cone height was lesser than that of the contact radius. Moreover, the mathematic model was verified effectively by testing magnetic field intensity of different cores based on scanning techniques.

Measurement of concentration and temperature using a fiber loop ring-down technique with core-offset structure,"Fang Wang, Heng Lu, Xu Wang, Yufang Liu, ","Optics Communications, Volume 410, 1 March 2018, Pages 13-16, ","Fiber-loop ring-down spectroscopy (FLRDS) technique can be used for measurement by indirectly measuring the ring-down time. This is advantageous because it is free from fluctuations of the light source and has a high sensitivity. A novel sensing system for measuring the concentration and temperature based on the FLRDS technique and Mach每Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is proposed in this work. The intra-cavity losses were compensated, which depended on the erbium-doped fiber amplifier. The sensor head was a section of 4 cm single-mode fiber that was spliced into the fiber loop ring cavity in a core-offset way, and its characteristics were tested by experimenting with different solution concentrations and temperatures. The experimental results showed that the detection limit of this system is 0.0014 g/ml, in the range of 0.010每0.400 g/ml. In the temperature sensing experiment, when the temperature varied from 30每200 ∼C, a sensitivity of 1.83 米s/∼C was achieved. This research demonstrated that the MZI-based FLRDS sensing system has a clear response to the solution and temperature; therefore, it provides a reference for the measurement of stress, pressure, curvature, and other physical quantities."

Comparisons of simulated surface energy fluxes among models showed that the net radiation and surface temperature generally had the best agreement among the schemes. On an average (annual and monthly) basis, the estimated latent heat fluxes agreed (to within approximate estimation errors) with the latent heat fluxes derived from a radiosonde-based atmospheric budget method for slightly more than half of the schemes. The sensible heat fluxes had larger differences among the schemes than did the latent heat fluxes, and the model-simulated ground heat fluxes had large variations among the schemes. The spatial patterns of the model-computed net radiation and surface temperature were generally similar among the schemes, and appear reasonable and consistent with observations of related variables, such as surface air temperature. The spatial mean patterns of latent and sensible heat fluxes were less similar than for net radiation, and the spatial patterns of the ground heat flux vary greatly among the 16 schemes. Generally, there is less similarity among the models in the temporal (interannual) variability of surface fluxes and temperature than there is in the mean fields, even for schemes with similar mean fields."

The evaluations support the following suggestions: (a) The mean annual runoff of all models follows, at least generally, the strong climatic East每West gradient of precipitation, although most models predict too much runoff in the dry part of the basin. (b) The mean monthly storage change tends to be underestimated, even though all models capture reasonably well the seasonality of the evapotranspiration. (c) The wide range of conceptualizations used for generation of surface and subsurface runoff strongly affect runoff generation on seasonal, and shorter, time scales. Model responses to summer precipitation ranged from almost no summer runoff (one model) to the (more common) situation of persistent overprediction of summer runoff, especially in the driest part of the basin. (d) All models tended to underpredict evapotranspiration in summer and overpredict in winter.

The researches on the impact of heavy DC transmission power and multiple HVDC lines on the convergence property of AC/DC power flow calculation are made on a modified IEEE 118-bus AC/DC hybrid test system. Simulation results show that the developed method under the model of alternate iterative method is superior to other methods under different models in convergence property. For the influence of heavy DC transmission power on the convergence property, it is improved by the new parameter configuration of DC transmission line firstly and adding proper new shunt capacitor on the weak nodes secondly; for the influence of multiple DC transmission lines on the convergence property, it can also be improved by the change of control mode firstly and adding new shunt capacitor secondly, which are based on the least square solution obtained by proposed method under the model of alternate iterative method."

Experiments on the short-term development of sine-generated meandering rivers,"Xiaolong Song, Guoqiang Xu, Yuchuan Bai, Dong Xu, ","Journal of Hydro-environment Research, Volume 11, June 2016, Pages 42-58, ","This paper presents recent works on the simulation of short-term development of sine-generated meandering river in laboratory conditions. The influences of initial system parameters on the evolution process of rivers are investigated, including control over channel sinuousness, channel width and dominant discharge, eventually leading to different results of planforms. Measurements on the bank-line, flow field, bed topography and sediment transport rate were carried out. Braided rivers are easy to produce using non-cohesive sediments in floodplains, whereas environmental temperatures and humidities could influence the fluvial process by their effects on material cohesion. Channelized rivers were obtained in the ※High Flow§ conditions and the river corridor width was proven to be mainly connected with initial channel sinuousness and water discharge. Sickle-shaped and bamboo leaves-shaped sandbars were formed in the channels during the transformation process of meandering to braiding, the stability degree of sandbars reflects the adaption of channel morphology to hydrodynamic condition. Quantitative analysis confirms the formation of free steady bars, which manifests the free response as a downstream oscillation of the perturbation. Damping length is mainly affected by dominant discharge, channel width is the secondary factor, and channel sinuousness is the weakest factor. The wavelength of steady bars approximately equals to half of the initial streamwise wavelength. Sediment transport rate tends to increase with the increasing of channel sinuousness but stops growing due to the excessive increase of flow route and flow friction. The experiment results could be useful for verifying river pattern discriminant functions and offer a basis for further study on the morphological evolution of large-scale natural rivers, such as Yangtze River."

Fault detection of the connection of lithium-ion power batteries in series for electric vehicles based on statistical analysis,"Mina Ma, Yu Wang, Qiangling Duan, Tangqin Wu, Qingsong Wang, ","Energy, Volume 164, 1 December 2018, Pages 745-756, ","Inter-cell virtual connection is likely to occur in the process of electric vehicles driving, which could cause fire or explosion accident. This paper presents a connecting fault detection method of lithium-ion power batteries in series. The cross-voltage test is adopted to distinguish contact resistance increases and internal resistance increases fault. The battery voltage and negative surface temperature are collected by battery test system and auxiliary channels equipment. The experimental battery based on first-order resistance and capacitance (RC) equivalent circuit and MATLAB/Simulink platform is simulated. The mean square error which indicates the difference between experiment and simulation is employed to describe voltage state of the cell. If the abnormal voltage exists, it is concluded that a fault occurs through analyzing the voltage abnormal coefficients based on modified Z-score, which is considered as a second-degree fault. The temperature rise rate is regarded as a secondary parameter to determine whether the second-degree fault deteriorates into a first-degree fault. According to different levels of failure, battery management system reminds users to take appropriate measures in practice. This work can provide an effective method of detecting lithium-ion power batteries connecting failure in series."

Pusey, ","American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Volume 27, Issue 6, June 1996, Pages 891-895, ","Primary hyperoxaluria type I (PHI) is a cause of end-stage renal disease in young people. It is caused by deficient activity of hepatic peroxisomal alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), which results in hyperoxalemia and hyperoxaluria. The consequent urolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis result in renal impairment, with further reduction in oxalate excretion and eventual systemic oxalosis. Historically, renal transplantation has yielded very poor results in these patients because of recurrent oxalosis of the graft. Within the last 10 years, combined hepatorenal transplantation has been successfully applied, simultaneously correcting the metabolic lesion in the liver and replacing the damaged kidneys. It has, however, become apparent that medical therapy with vigorous hydration, inhibitors of stone formation and pyridoxine (AGT co-factor), may be successful at delaying, and occasionally in preventing, urolithiasis in some hyperoxaluric patients, particularly those whose hyperoxaluria is reduced by pyridoxine. This, together with intensive perioperative management and modem surgical methods of stone management such as lithotripsy, laser or ultrasound stone fragmentation, and peroutaneous nephrolithotomy, means that renal transplantation alone may be feasible in selected patients. We describe a patient with PHI with clinical and biochemical evidence of significant residual AGT activity who underwent a successful live-related renal transplantation with excellent renal function and no stone recurrence 1 year posttransplantation. The appropriate transplantation strategies for these complex patients are discussed and include isolated renal transplantation for those patients who are without significant systemic oxalosis and have evidence of residual AGT activity."

The commonly accepted pathogenic hypothesis of IPF is the trigger from continuous alveolar epithelium microinjuries and in the following series events, many signaling pathways were reported to lead to abnormal tissue repair and lung structure derangement in IPF, such as TGF-汕, wnt, VEGF and PI3K每Akt signaling pathways. Traditional research of IPF related signaling pathway always focus on the independent function of pathway and disease signals, but the crosstalks and interactions among them were rarely valued. In this review, we summarize the signaling pathways which were reported to play important roles in the pathologic changes of IPF and the synergistic effect among those pathways. Next we discuss the application of genomics research and bioinformatics tools on IPF related pathway analysis, and give a systems biology perspective by integrating multi-level disease related data. The novel prospective of pathway analysis could tease out the complex pathway interaction profiles of IPF, and is powerful to detect IPF related biomarkers for early diagnose and potential therapeutic targets."

By using the numerical integral formula, the least squares form for the system identification is obtained. In order to reduce the effect of noises existing in the input and output measurements, the compensation method for the input and output noises is also studied by introducing an auxiliary high-order fractional-order system in the revised identification algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by the simulation result of an illustrative example and the experimental result of temperature identification for a thermal system."

Glycyrrhizin ameliorates inflammatory pain by inhibiting microglial activation-mediated inflammatory response via blockage of the HMGB1-TLR4-NF-kB pathway,"Xiaojuan Sun, Hongyou Zeng, Qingsong Wang, Qingwen Yu, Hongxing Zhang, ","Experimental Cell Research, Volume 369, Issue 1, 1 August 2018, Pages 112-119, ","Chronic inflammatory pain is a severe clinical problem that greatly affects patients＊ quality of life and causes huge economic burden. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation exerts critical roles in the pathogenic progression of inflammatory pain. Recent evidence corroborates the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective efficacy of glycyrrhizin; however, its function in inflammatory pain remains poorly elucidated. In the present study, glycyrrhizin suppressed LPS-induced activation of microglial cell BV2 by inhibiting NO production and expression of microglial marker IBA-1. Intriguingly, LPS-induced high expression and generation of inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6, TNF-汐 and IL-1汕) was notably reversed by glycyrrhizin pre-treatment. Mechanistic analysis confirmed that high expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in LPS-activated microglia was inhibited following glycyrrhizin. More importantly, restoring HMGB1 expression by recombinant adenovirus vector of Ad-HMGB1 counteracted glycyrrhizin-restrained inflammatory response in microglia upon LPS stimulation. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin dampened the activation of subsequent TLR4-NF-百B pathway in LPS-stimulated microglia, which was abrogated by HMGB1 elevation. Furthermore, blocking this pathway by si-TLR4 transfection reversed the effects of HMGB1 overexpression on the inhibitor roles of glycyrrhizin in microglia-triggered inflammation. Additionally, glycyrrhizin administration also alleviated CFA-evoked mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in inflammatory pain model of mice, concomitant with suppression in inflammatory response and microglial activation. Simultaneously, elevation of HMGB1, TLR4 and p65-NF-百B protein expression induced by CFA injection was also abrogated after glycyrrhizin. Accordingly, this study reveal that glycyrrhizin may act as a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of inflammatory pain."

Furthermore, we analyzed the algebraic symmetries of the matrices in the state-vector formalism for anisotropic plates. The basic feature of the proposed method was the expansion of field quantities by Legendre polynomials. The Legendre polynomial method avoid to solve the transcendental dispersion equation, which can only be solved numerically. This state-vector formalism combined with Legendre polynomial expansion distinguished the adjacent dispersion mode clearly, even when the modes were very close. We then illustrated the theoretical solutions of the dispersion curves by this method for isotropic and anisotropic plates.

The theoretical methane yield was further predicted based on the equilibrium in the downstream processes. A C每H每O ternary diagram is proposed to predict the boundary for the formation of carbon deposit. Three zones, namely carbon deposit, carbon-free and intermediate zone, are defined, with possible carbon formation or elimination mechanisms being postulated. The biomass gasification performance using different gasifying agents, namely H2O, CO2, O2 or air, was then analyzed. Results showed that the steam addition is conductive to enhance carbon conversion and shrink the carbon deposit zone, but the use of air, O2 and CO2 will impose a negative impact on the methane yield and H2/CO ratio. The maximum methane yield can be achieved at the temperature at which carbon is completely converted. The effects of pressure are dependent on whether or not solid carbon is absent. Based on the analysis on thermodynamic and exergetic efficiencies, it is concluded that steam gasification is the preferred conversion scheme for biomethane production."

It is popular among the mobile users to take photos including selfies whenever and wherever they like, and further the captured photos are shared to their friends through social networks such as Facebook and WeChat. However, an increasing issue with the large number of photos taken by a mobile user is local photo management, e.g., image searching among the photos without image tags. Another issue is that photo sharing on social networks may infringe on the privacy of the unintended human objects in the images. In this paper, an automatic privacy protection and tag suggestion system, AutoPrivacy, is proposed for mobile social images. In particular, AutoPrivacy attempts to exploit sensors signatures, image processing, and the recognition model to achieve automatic privacy protection for the unintended human objects and tagging suggestion for the intended human objects. We utilize public album data of volunteers from Facebook to test the proposed automatic system, and the experimental results on an Android platform show that AutoPrivacy can perform real time detection of intended/unintended human objects and in turn provide accurate privacy protection for unintended human objects, while the tagging suggestion for the intended human objects is efficient requiring less additional storage."

Compared to the case of no porous insert, embedding aluminum metal foam in the air flow channel significantly improved the thermal management of Li-ion battery cell. The results also indicated that, decreasing the porosity of the porous structure decreases both standard deviation of the temperature field and maximum temperature inside the battery. Moreover, increasing the permeability of the metal foam drops the maximum temperature inside the battery while decreasing this property leads to improving the temperature uniformity.

Have pedestrian subsystem tests improved passenger car front shape?,"Guibing Li, Fang Wang, Dietmar Otte, Zhihua Cai, Ciaran Simms, ","Accident Analysis & Prevention, Volume 115, June 2018, Pages 143-150, ","Subsystem impactor tests are the main approaches for evaluation of safety performance of vehicle front design for pedestrian protection in legislative regulations. However, the main aspects of vehicle safety for pedestrians are shape and stiffness, and though it is clear that subsystem impact tests encourage lower vehicle front stiffness, it is unclear whether they promote improved vehicle front shapes for pedestrian protection. The purpose of this paper is therefore to investigate the effects of European pedestrian safety regulations on passenger car front shape and pedestrian injury risk using recent German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) pedestrian collision data and numerical simulations. Firstly, a sample of 579 pedestrian collision cases involving 190 different car models between 2000每2015 extracted from the GIDAS was used to compare front-end shapes of passenger cars manufactured before and after the legislative pedestrian safety regulations were introduced in Europe. The focus was on changes in passenger car front shape and differences in pedestrian AIS2+ (Abbreviated Injury Scale at least level 2) leg, pelvis/femur and head injury risk observed in collisions. Multi-body simulations were also used to assess changes in vehicle aggressivity due to the observed changes in vehicle shape. The results show that newer passenger cars tend to have a flatter and wider bumper, higher bonnet leading edge, shorter and steeper bonnet and a shallower windscreen. Both the collision data and the numerical simulations indicate that newer passenger car front bumper designs are significantly safer for pedestrians＊ legs. However, the results also show that the higher bonnet leading edge in newer passenger cars is poor for pedestrian pelvis/femur protection, even though newer cars show an obviously lower AIS2+ injury risk to younger pedestrians in collisions. Newer cars have a lower AIS2+ head injury risk for pedestrians in collisions, but the numerical analysis indicate that this is not likely due to shape changes in passenger car fronts. Overall, the introduction of pedestrian safety regulations has resulted in reductions in pedestrian injury risk, but further benefits would accrue from tests which promote a lower bonnet leading edge. The influence of vehicle shape on pedestrian head injury risk remains unclear."

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play prominent roles in inflammatory responses. And TLR5 is overexpressed in several diseases. Here in our study, we investigated the effect of TLR5 in high fat-induced atherosclerosis via NF-百B signaling pathway modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing. Our results found that high fat induced atherosclerosis in wild type mice with fat accumulation and inflammatory response through NF-百B activation. Contrastly, TLR5 knockout mice displayed lower fat accumulation and ameliorated inflammation after high fat feeding with NF-百B inactivation. In addition, pterostilbene, as a natural dimethyl ether derivative of resveratrol mainly from blueberries, has diverse pharmacological activities, especially anti-inflammation. Our study also found that pterostilbene displayed inhibited role in suppressing inflammatory response through inactivating NF-百B signaling pathway regulated by TLR5 down-regulation in high fat-induced mice. Moreover, in vitro experiments of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) challenged with LPS or TNF-汐, further indicated that NF-百B was involved in atherosclerosis progression, leading to high secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, VSMCs from TLR5 deficient mice inhibited phosphorylated levels of NF-百B signalilng pathway, finally resulting in down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. Notably, pterostilbene also displayed suppressed role in inflammatory response via NF-百B inactivity in LPS or TNF-汐-induced VSMCs by decreasing TLR5 expression. The results above indicated a novel therapeutic strategy of pterostilbene to protect against atherosclerosis via TLR5 regulation for clinic treatment in the future."

China's international air transportation has been liberalized progressively and significantly after 1992, and its degree of openness in June 2016 was three times that in 2000. Hitherto, there has been no long time series and comprehensive quantitative measurement on the liberalization of a country's international air transport policy, especially covering all ASAs and their amendments, which could help understand the development of China's policy.

Therefore, this paper focuses on the GC resistance mechanisms of non-glucocorticoids receptor, including P-gp, MIF, TLR9, and Th17 cells. These molecular mechanisms may help diagnose GC resistance and provide an alternative treatment strategy to reverse GC resistance by blocking the underlying mechanisms.Download high-res image (116KB)Download full-size image"
Multicellular Tumor Spheroids as a Model for Assessing Delivery of Oligonucleotides in Three Dimensions,"Kyle Carver, Xin Ming, Rudolph L Juliano, ","Molecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids, Volume 3, January 2014, Article e153, ","Oligonucleotides have shown promise in selectively manipulating gene expression in vitro, but that success has not translated to the clinic for cancer therapy. A potential reason for this is that cells behave differently in monolayer than in the three-dimensional tumor, resulting in limited penetration and distribution of oligonucleotides in the tumor. This may be especially true when oligonucleotides are associated with nanocarriers such as lipoplexes and polyplexes, commonly used delivery vehicles for oligonucleotides. The multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS), a three-dimensional model that closely resembles small avascular tumors and micrometastases, has been utilized as an intermediate between monolayer culture and in vivo studies for the screening of small-molecule drugs. However, spheroids have been little used for the study of various oligonucleotide delivery formulations. Here, we have evaluated the uptake and efficacy of splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides using various delivery modalities in two- and three-dimensional culture models. We find that the size of the delivery agent dramatically influences penetration into the spheroid and thus the biological effect of the oligonucleotides. We hypothesize that the MCTS model will prove to be a useful tool in the future development of oligonucleotide delivery formulations."

Temporal context processing within hippocampal subfields,"Fang Wang, Rachel A. Diana, ","NeuroImage, Volume 134, 1 July 2016, Pages 261-269, ","The episodic memory system can differentiate similar events based on the temporal information associated with the events. Temporal context, which is at least partially determined by the events that precede or follow the critical event, may be a cue to differentiate events. The purpose of the present study is to investigate whether the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG)/CA3 and CA1 subfields are sensitive to changes in temporal context and, if so, whether the subregions show a linear or threshold-like response to similar temporal contexts. Participants incidentally encoded a series of object picture triplets and 20 of them were included in final analyses. The third picture in each triplet was operationally defined as the target and the first two pictures served as temporal context for the target picture. Each target picture was presented twice with temporal context manipulated to be either repeated, high similarity, low similarity, or new on the second presentation. We extracted beta parameters for the repeated target as a function of the type of temporal context. We expected to see repetition suppression, a reduction in the beta values, in response to repetition of the target. If temporal context information is included in the representation of the target within a given region, this repetition suppression should be greater for target images that were preceded by their original context than for target images preceded by a new context. Neuroimaging results showed that CA1, but not DG/CA3, modifies the target's representation based on its temporal context. Right CA1 did not distinguish high similarity temporal context from repeated context but did distinguish low similarity temporal context from repeated context. These results indicate that CA1 is sensitive to temporal context and suggest that it does not differentiate between a substantially similar temporal context and an identical temporal context. In contrast, DG/CA3 does not appear to process temporal context as defined in the current experiment."
Numerical simulation on the thermal performance of hydraulic floor heating system with phase change materials,"Ming Zhao, Tingting Zhu, Changning Wang, Hao Chen, Yuwen Zhang, ","Applied Thermal Engineering, Volume 93, 25 January 2016, Pages 900-907, ","A two-dimensional coupled heat transfer model based on variable thermophysical parameters of PCM is established from the building with phase change thermal storage structure in this paper. The results show that the thermal conductivity of PCM plays a central role in maintaining air temperature during the PCM solidification. Comparison between the effects of PCM floors and concrete floors on indoor temperatures shows that the air temperature fluctuation in the cavity with PCM structure is in a smaller magnitude, and the temperature control system is relatively simple. Moreover, improving the thermal conductivity of PCM can accelerate thermal diffusion rate, reduce thermal inertia and shorten the storage time of the heating system. A new floor heat storage structure to accelerate the air temperature rise in the cavity is proposed, and an empirical correlation between the phase change temperature and the air temperature in the cavity is also presented."
Simulations of roughness initiation and growth on railway rails,"X. Sheng, D. J. Thompson, C. J. C. Jones, G. Xie, S. S. Hsu, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, Volume 293, Issues 3每5, 13 June 2006, Pages 819-829, ","A model for the prediction of the initiation and growth of roughness on the rail is presented. The vertical interaction between a train and the track is calculated as a time history for single or multiple wheels moving on periodically supported rails, using a wavenumber-based approach. This vertical dynamic wheel/rail force arises from the varying stiffness due to discrete supports (i.e. parametric excitation) and the roughness excitation on the railhead. The tangential contact problem between the wheel and rail is modelled using an unsteady two-dimensional approach and also using the three-dimensional contact model, FASTSIM. This enables the slip and stick regions in the contact patch to be identified from the input geometry and creepage between the wheel and rail. The long-term wear growth is then predicted by applying repeated passages of the vehicle wheelsets, as part of an iterative solution."

Analysis of melting of alloy powder bed with constant heat flux,"Bin Xiao, Yuwen Zhang, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 50, Issues 11每12, June 2007, Pages 2161-2169, ","Melting of an alloy powder bed with constant heat flux for application in selective laser sintering (SLS) is analyzed in this paper. Since melting of an alloy occurs in a range of temperatures, instead of at a single melting point, there will be a mushy zone 每 containing partially melted powders 每 between the unmelted region and the completely melted region. The mushy zone can be further divided into two sub-regions: (1) a lower part with constant porosity (shrinkage takes place), and (2) an upper part with constant volume (no shrinkage). Temperature distributions in different regions and locations of melting interfaces are obtained using an integral approximation method. The results show that increasing initial porosity and temperature of the powder bed accelerate the melting process. The melting slows down with increasing thermal conductivity of the interstitial gas."
"Effect of synthetic water and cement solutions on the swelling pressure of compacted Gaomiaozi(GMZ) bentonite: The Beishan site case, Gansu, China","Zhao Sun, Yong-gui Chen, Yu-jun Cui, Hao-dong Xu, Dong-Bei Wu, ","Engineering Geology, Volume 244, 3 October 2018, Pages 66-74, ","After construction of the repository, the bentonite will undergo some chemical effects resulting from the chemistry of site water and the solution produced by cement degradation in the high-level radioactive waste repository. In this study, the swelling pressure of compacted Gaomiaozi(GMZ) bentonite was investigated with three types of pore water simulating site groundwater (synthetic Beishan Site Water - BSW) and two cement solutions (Young Cement Water 每 YCW and Evolved Cement Water 每 ECW). X-Ray diffractometry (XRD) tests were also carried out to analyse the mineralogy of the samples before and after the swelling pressure tests. Results show that the swelling pressure curve is of ※double-peak§ pattern, which fades with the pH of solutions increase. The swelling pressure of GMZ bentonite decreases little with BSW, significantly with YCW and slightly with ECW. At a higher dry density, the swelling pressure of compacted GMZ bentonite reaches stability later and the final swelling pressure is higher. Cation exchange takes place in the bentonite and the montmorillonite of GMZ bentonite transforms to multi-cation dominant montmorillonite with the three types of pore waters. The swelling pressure reduction affected by the cement solutions is mainly due to the montmorillonite dissolution, but the secondary minerals are in amorphous phases. The swelling property of compacted GMZ bentonite can be reduced by cement solutions in the long-term operation of repository."
Co-gasification of coal and biomass in a fixed bed reactor with separate and mixed bed configurations,"Yan Zhang, Yan Zheng, ","Fuel, Volume 183, 1 November 2016, Pages 132-138, ","This study inspects the occurrence of synergy in the co-gasification of coal and biomass in a fixed bed reactor. Two separate and a pre-mixed bed configurations with a congruent sample mass are designed for comparative study. The intimate contact between bio-ash and coal char grains is a prerequisite for the occurrence of the synergy effect in the co-gasification of coal and biomass. The separate bed configurations generally form either a coal-char/bio-ash or a bio-ash/coal-ash interface, whereas the pre-mixed bed configuration produces well-dispersed bio-ashes that come into close contact with coal char grains. As a result, a stronger synergy effect occurs in the mixed bed configuration rather than in the separate configuration. A novel method is explored to collect and determine the heavy tar and water yields generated during the initial pyrolysis step. Results show that bio-char bed has better tar cracking performance than coal char bed.Download high-res image (90KB)Download full-size image"
Energy-aware mixed partitioning scheduling in standby-sparing systems,"Yi-wen Zhang, ","Computer Standards & Interfaces, Volume 61, January 2019, Pages 129-136, ","Previous standby-sparing techniques assume that all tasks don't access to shared resources. In addition, primary tasks and backup tasks are allocated to the primary processor and spare processor respectively. Spare processor schedules tasks with maximum processor speed. Unlike previous techniques, we have studied the problem of minimizing energy consumption and preserving the original reliability for dynamic-priority real-time task set with shared resources in a standby-sparing system. We propose a novel energy-aware mixed partitioning scheduling algorithm (EAMPSA). Earliest deadline first/dynamic deadline modification (EDF/DDM) scheduling scheme is used to ensure that the shared resources can be accessed in a mutual exclusive manner. Uniformly speed is used to the primary processor and the spare processor. In addition, we use the mixed mapping partitioning of primary and backup tasks method to map tasks. A novel method of mapping task is proposed i.e. the tasks which need to access to shared resources are mapped into the primary processor and the tasks which have no resource requirements are mapped into the spare processor. Furthermore, DVS and DPM techniques are used for both primary and backup tasks to save energy. The experimental results show that the EAMPSA algorithm consumes average 55.43% less energy than that of the SSPT algorithm."
Negative temperatures and the definition of entropy,"Robert H.

Several researchers have identified the thermodynamic entropy exclusively with the ※volume entropy§ suggested by Gibbs, and have further concluded that by this definition, negative temperatures violate the principles of thermodynamics. We disagree with these conclusions. We demonstrate that volume entropy is inconsistent with the postulates of thermodynamics for systems with non-monotonic energy densities, while a definition of entropy based on the probability distributions of macroscopic variables does satisfy the postulates of thermodynamics. Our results confirm that negative temperature is a valid extension of thermodynamics."

"Microwave photodielectric and photoconductivity studies on titanium dioxide exposed to continuous, polychromatic irradiation Part I: A novel analytical tool to assess the photoactivity of titanium dioxide","Michele Edge, Robert Janes, Julie Robinson, Norman Allen, John Warman, ","Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry, Volume 113, Issue 2, 28 February 1998, Pages 171-180, ","A novel analytical method is described which allows the charge-carrier dynamics taking place when titanium dioxide is subjected to ultrabandgap irradiation to be measured. Samples are exposed continuously to polychromatic light and photophysical processes monitored in real-time. The method relies on the perturbations that take place in the stored energy characteristics of a microwave cavity. In such a device, the electric and magnetic fields of the microwave energy reach a maximum when they are resonant with the cavity. Titanium dioxide powders held in the cavity, and simultaneously irradiated with visible light, produce free-carriers which reduce the stored energy density of the cavity. This results in a shift in the value of the resonant frequency and an attenuation of the microwave power, which are in proportion to the population of free-carriers produced in the sample. The frequency measurements are tempered by the presence of localised (trapped) carriers. Uncoupling the changes in power and frequency allows the dynamics of free and trapped carriers to be quantified. The results derived from this real-time method are consistent with those reported from time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements, which follow the decay of conductivity following a pulse of high intensity light. In addition, the real-time method follows the build-up of charge-carriers during irradiation as well as their decay immediately after irradiation. Data is presented for anatase, rutile and a sample of mixed morphology (75% anatase:25% rutile ). The influences of sample size, humidity, temperature, light-intensity and wavelength on the microwave response, are considered."
Controllable recovery of ammonium substituted polyoxovanadate acid compound (ASPOVC) from aqueous/leaching solution by primary amines,"Jiawei Wen, Pengge Ning, Hongbin Cao, Zhi Sun, Yi Zhang, ","Journal of Cleaner Production, In press, accepted manuscript, Available online 7 September 2018, ","The recovery of polyoxovanadate acid compounds has got increasing attention because of both sustainable necessities and material applications. In this paper, we proposed a recovery strategy of ammonium substituted polyoxovanadate acid compounds (ASPOVC) by solvent extraction from leaching/aqueous solution.

Subsequently, the compounds were characterized by comprehensive techniques, from which the molecular structures with hydrogen bonds were described. The solubility parameters were calculated, and solid ASPOVC was the biggest among the four compounds, explaining formation reasons of different states. The amine extractants performed well-efficiency (more than 98.5%) for reutilization.

Cluster-level trust prediction based on multi-modal social networks,"Weiyu Zhang, Bin Wu, Yang Liu, ","Neurocomputing, Volume 210, 19 October 2016, Pages 206-216, ","Trust relation is an important connection in many online social services, and it can help online users seek reliable information. To improve trust prediction performance and alleviate the sparsity of explicit trust graph, we aggregate heterogeneous networks from both an explicit trust graph and a rating graph and exploit the effect of cluster-level trust prediction. In this paper, we propose a framework incorporating co-clustering users and item methods and aggregating of multi-model similarity of users. We first co-cluster users and items to obtain several meaningful user-item subgroups. In these subgroups, user preference on items subset is more accurate and consistent. Then, in each subgroup, we separately calculate explicit and implicit similarities between two users. Explicit similarity is achieved through Katz method based on the explicit trust graph; however, implicit similarity is calculated by our proposed method based on the rating graph. Moreover, we combine explicit and implicit similarities using a linear combination method. User pairs may belong to one or more subgroups. Therefore, we merge all aggregated similarity from all belonging subgroups to achieve trust prediction. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that proposed framework can obtain a significant improvement in terms of prediction accuracy criteria over representative approaches."
Systematic reviews experience major limitations in reporting absolute effects,"Pablo Alonso-Coello, Alonso Carrasco-Labra, Romina Brignardello-Petersen, Ignacio Neumann, Gordon H. Guyatt, ","Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, Volume 72, April 2016, Pages 16-26, ","Expressing treatment effects in relative terms yields larger numbers than expressions in absolute terms, affecting the judgment of the clinicians and patients regarding the treatment options. It is uncertain how authors of systematic reviews (SRs) absolute effect estimates are reported in. We therefore undertook a systematic survey to identify and describe the reporting and methods for calculating absolute effect estimates in SRs.Two reviewers independently screened title, abstract, and full text and extracted data from a sample of Cochrane and non-Cochrane SRs. We used regression analyses to examine the association between study characteristics and the reporting of absolute estimates for the most patient-important outcome.We included 202 SRs (98 Cochrane and 104 non-Cochrane), most of which (92.1%) included standard meta-analyses including relative estimates of effect. Of the 202 SRs, 73 (36.1%) reported absolute effect estimates for the most patient-important outcome. SRs with statistically significant effects were more likely to report absolute estimates (odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval: 1.08, 4.74). The most commonly reported absolute estimates were: for each intervention, risk of adverse outcomes expressed as a percentage (41.1%); number needed to treat (26.0%); and risk for each intervention expressed as natural units or natural frequencies (24.7%). In 12.3% of the SRs that reported absolute effect estimates for both benefit and harm outcomes, harm outcomes were reported exclusively as absolute estimates. Exclusively reporting of beneficial outcomes as absolute estimates occurred in 6.8% of the SRs.Most SRs do not report absolute effects. Those that do often report them inadequately, thus requiring users of SRs to generate their own estimates of absolute effects. For any apparently effective or harmful intervention, SR authors should report both absolute and relative estimates to optimize the interpretation of their findings."
Data-driven output-feedback fault-tolerant control for unknown dynamic systems with faults changing system dynamics,"Jun-Sheng Wang, Guang-Hong Yang, ","Journal of Process Control, Volume 43, July 2016, Pages 10-23, ","This paper studies the data-driven output-feedback fault-tolerant control (FTC) problem for unknown dynamic systems with faults changing system dynamics.

To detect faults and write the system state via the input每output data, an approach to data-driven design of a residual generator with a full-rank transformation matrix is presented.

Finally, two numerical examples and a practical example of a DC motor control system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

It has been widely accepted that both climatic conditions and land use have great impact on sandy desertification in northern China. However, the relative role and synergistic effect of each driving force of sandy desertification are still not clear. In this paper, an indicator named as SI was defined to represent the integrated probability of sandy desertification caused by land use. A quantitative method was developed for characterizing the relative roles of annual precipitation and land use to sandy desertification in both spatial and temporal dimensions at county level. Results showed that, at county level, land use was the main cause of sandy desertification for Naiman Banner since 1987每2009. In the case of spatial dimension, the different combination of land use types decided the distribution of sandy desertification probability and finally decided the spatial pattern of bared sand land. In the case of temporal dimension, the synergistic effect of land use and precipitation highly influenced the spatial distribution of sandy desertification."

Gemcitabine-erlotinib therapy has demonstrated a survival benefit for patients with metastatic PDAC. Here we report the first phase 2 study of erlotinib in combination with adjuvant chemoradiation and chemotherapy for resected PDAC.Forty-eight patients with resected PDAC received adjuvant erlotinib (100 mg daily) and capecitabine (800 mg/m2 twice daily Monday-Friday) concurrently with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 50.4 Gy over 28 fractions followed by 4 cycles of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days) and erlotinib (100 mg daily). The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS).The median follow-up time was 18.2 months (interquartile range, 13.8-27.1). Lymph nodes were positive in 85% of patients, and margins were positive in 17%. The median RFS was 15.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.4-17.9), and the median overall survival (OS) was 24.4 months (95% CI, 18.9-29.7). Multivariate analysis with adjustment for known prognostic factors showed that tumor diameter >3 cm was predictive for inferior RFS (hazard ratio, 4.01; P=.001) and OS (HR, 4.98; P=.02), and the development of dermatitis was associated with improved RFS (HR, 0.27; P=.009). During CRT and post-CRT chemotherapy, the rates of grade 3/4 toxicity were 31%/2% and 35%/8%, respectively.Erlotinib can be safely administered with adjuvant IMRT-based CRT and chemotherapy. The efficacy of this regimen appears comparable to that of existing adjuvant regimens. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0848 will ultimately determine whether erlotinib produces a survival benefit in patients with resected pancreatic cancer."

Undesirable cardiac arrhythmias associated with rate hysteresis pacemakers,"Mark E. Thompson, James A. Shaver, ","The American Journal of Cardiology, Volume 38, Issue 6, 23 November 1976, Pages 685-688, ","The introduction of the ventricular inhibited pulse generator with the feature of rate hysteresis has been associated with a variety of rhythm disturbances, some causing serious concern. This pulse generator has two different pacing rates: (1) the automatic rate, which is the interval between two successive paced beats (usually 860 msec or 70/min), and (2) the hysteresis interval, which results in a 1,000 msec delay between a sensed cardiac contraction and the next pacemaker discharge. The hysteresis interval after a sensed signal may result in long pauses that may predispose to the development of serious cardiac arrhythmias. Two examples of this type of complication were recently observed. One patient had bigeminal rhythm with mechanically ineffective cardiac contractions and an effective cardiac rate of 35/min; he experienced dyspnea and weakness during these prolonged episodes. Another patient had repeated episodes of ventricular fibrillation. The cardiac arrhythmias were not controlled by antiarrhythmic agents, and both patients required replacement of the pulse generator.The proposed advantages of pulse generator hysteresis are (1) prolongation of battery life, and (2) maintenance of effective atrial transport; these advantages may be outweighed by undesirable cardiac arrhythmias that may be associated with this mode of pacemaker function. Rate hysteresis cardiac pacemakers should be reserved for patients having predominantly sinus rhythm without ventricular irritability. In patients with frequent ectopic ventricular activity, atrial fibrillation or high degree atrioventricular block, the rate hysteresis pacemaker offers no advantage over the conventional demand pacemaker. For patients with frequent ectopic ventricular activity not easily controlled by antiarrhythmic agents, consideration should be given to the use of a permanent demand pacemaker with external rate control, which may provide greater flexibility in arrhythmia management."

A novel integrated simulation approach couples MCRT and Gebhart methods to simulate solar radiation transfer in a solar power tower system with a cavity receiver,"Kun Wang, Ya-Ling He, Yu Qiu, Yuwen Zhang, ","Renewable Energy, Volume 89, April 2016, Pages 93-107, ","An integrated simulation approach, which couples Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT) and Gebhart methods, is proposed to simulate solar radiation transfer in a solar power tower system with a cavity receiver. The MCRT method is used to simulate the solar radiation transfer process from the heliostat field to interior surfaces of the cavity receiver, and the Gebhart method is used to simulate the multiple reflections process of solar radiation within the cavity. This integrated simulation method not only reveals the cavity effect on receiver performance but also provides real-time simulation results. Based on this method, the reflection loss of the cavity receiver and solar flux distributions are discussed in detail. The results indicate that the cavity effect can significantly reduce the reflection loss and homogenize the concentrated solar energy distributed on interior surfaces to some extent. Moreover, the surface absorptivity has less effect on the reflection loss when cavity effect is considered. The cavity effect on homogenizing solar flux distributions is greater with lower surface absorptivity. In addition, although the concentrated solar energy is distributed on the cavity aperture with similar shapes at different times, the shape of the solar flux distribution on interior surfaces varies greatly with time."
Reparability measurement of vision sensor in active stereo visual system,"Ting Xue, Bin Wu, ","Measurement, Volume 49, March 2014, Pages 275-282, ","The active visual inspection has made giant strides in development. Due to the complexity of field conditions, the binocular stereo vision sensor in active stereo visual inspection system is difficult to acquire the ideal image pair under the poor illumination environment, or cannot work normally because one of two cameras is damaged. To solve the practical problem, a reparability method of the vision sensor in active stereo visual inspection system is proposed. Based on the traditional measurement platform with a structured stripe projector and two industrial cameras, a reparability mathematical model is established, which merges the measurement mode of the stereo vision and the structured light vision to inspect feature points based on the reparability measurement model. Meanwhile, a mathematical model and calibration method of the structured light vision are developed based on the homography between the image and light plane. The method greatly improved the stability and reliability of measurement data. It is proven by experiment that the method is valid, which can accomplish reparability tasks commendably and achieve uninterrupted inspection of feature points in the actual industrial applications."

Estimating wind speed probability distribution by diffusion-based kernel density method,"Xiaoyuan Xu, Zheng Yan, Shaolun Xu, ","Electric Power Systems Research, Volume 121, April 2015, Pages 28-37, ","Accurate estimation of wind speed probability distributions is a challenging task in wind power planning and operation. Different from the commonly used parametric methods which consist of selecting a suitable parametric model and estimating the parameters, this paper presents an improved non-parametric method to estimate wind speed probability distributions. Based on the diffusion partial differential equation in finite domain, this method accounts for both bandwidth selection and boundary correction of kernel density estimation. Preprocessing techniques are designed to handle data with different recording manners to produce smooth probability density functions. Probability densities of specific grid points are obtained by inverse discrete cosine transformation and are further used to calculate assessment indices of wind resources. The method has been tested to estimate probability densities of parametric distributions and actual wind speed data measured in different places. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is of practical value in fitting wind speed distribution models."
Identification and functional characterization of NEMO in Crassostrea gigas reveals its crucial role in the NF-百B activation,"Dongbo Chen, Mingjia Yu, Hongmei Chen, Manhong Zeng, Qingsong Huang, ","Fish & Shellfish Immunology, Volume 80, September 2018, Pages 46-55, ","NEMO (NF-百B essential modulator) is one of the important regulatory subunits of the I百B kinase (I百K) complex that controls the activation of the NF-百B signaling pathway. Here, we have identified the homolog of NEMO from the pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. CgNEMO harbors the conserved the I百K binding region, NEMO ubiquitin binding domain and Zinc finger domain. In terms of tissue distribution, CgNEMO is expressed in various tissues with an observed highest expression in the hemocytes. Furthermore, infection by two related Vibrio strains significantly increased CgNEMO expression in the hemocytes. Cell culture based luciferase reporter assays showed that CgNEMO activates the NF-百B reporter in a dose-pendent manner. Moreover, CgNEMO was also found to counter the IkB-dependent inhibitory effect on NF-百B activation, providing a plausible mechanism of NF-百B activation by CgNEMO. Meanwhile, site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the putative ubiquitination site K535 is required for the activation of NF-百B, implying that ubiquitination of NEMO may be involved in regulating its activity. Finally, RNAi mediated knockdown of CgNEMO in vivo significantly compromised the bacterial induction of key cytokines TNF-汐 and IL-17, strongly suggesting a role for CgNEMO in acute immune defense in oyster. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into our understanding about the evolution of NEMO mediated NF-百B activation and the induction of cytokine. Our findings may provide valuable information about diseases control and management in oyster aquaculture."

Cooperation of Demand Response and Traditional Power Generations for Providing Spinning Reserve,"Sheng Wang, Hongxun Hui, Yi Ding, Chengzhi Zhu, ","Energy Procedia, Volume 142, December 2017, Pages 2035-2041, ","Spinning reserve in the electric power system is vital in dealing with the sudden drop of electricity supply caused by failure, which used to be provided by traditional power generations. With the development of information and communication technologies (ICTs), demand response (DR) is deployed gradually for providing spinning reserve by shedding flexible loads. Air conditioners (ACs) are one of the most high-quality flexible loads due to its high proportion of capacity in electricity consumption. However, power rebound spike (PRS) of AC loads tend to emerge at the end of DR. Therefore, traditional spinning reserve providers (TSRPs) have to ramp to cooperate with ACs immediately. In this paper, a DR management approach is proposed for controlling DR duration time and capacity by sequent temperature configuration. Meanwhile, the connection between PRS and DR duration time is studied. Reliability indices have also been applied to evaluate different cooperation strategies between ACs and TSRPs. Simulations based on Monte Carlo methods are performed quantitatively."
Data-driven output-feedback fault-tolerant L2 control of unknown dynamic systems,"Jun-Sheng Wang, Guang-Hong Yang, ","ISA Transactions, Volume 63, July 2016, Pages 182-195, ","This paper studies the data-driven output-feedback fault-tolerant L2-control problem for unknown dynamic systems. In a framework of active fault-tolerant control (FTC), three issues are addressed, including fault detection, controller reconfiguration for optimal guaranteed cost control, and tracking control. According to the data-driven form of observer-based residual generators, the system state is expressed in the form of the measured input每output data. On this basis, a model-free approach to L2 control of unknown linear time-invariant (LTI) discrete-time plants is given. To achieve tracking control, a design method for a pre-filter is also presented. With the aid of the aforementioned results and the input每output data-based time-varying value function approximation structure, a data-driven FTC scheme ensuring L2-gain properties is developed. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, two simulation examples are employed."
Effect of natural convection on laser chemical vapor deposition with a stationary laser beam,"Yuwen Zhang, ","International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow, Volume 25, Issue 4, August 2004, Pages 683-691, ",Effect of natural convection on laser chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) of titanium nitride on a finite slab under irradiation by a stationary laser beam is investigated numerically.

The effects of laser beam properties and initial pressure of the source gases are also investigated.
Predictors of satisfaction with excess skin and desire for body contouring after bariatric surgery,"Kristine J. Steffen, David B. Sarwer, J. Kevin Thompson, Astrid Mueller, James E. Mitchell, ","Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases, Volume 8, Issue 1, January每February 2012, Pages 92-97, ","Bariatric surgery (BS) produces rapid, massive weight loss, often leaving patients with excess skin that can be esthetically disappointing and can present barriers to physical and psychosocial functioning. Thus, body contouring surgery (BCS) is frequently sought by post-BS patients. The objectives of the present study were to characterize the frequency at which post-BS patients desire BCS and the extent to which patients are satisfied with the excess skin in specific body regions before and after contouring. Furthermore, the present study sought to identify the predictors of which patients might be most desirous of BCS. This was a study conducted at 2 academic research centers.Patients approximately 2 years or 6每10 years after BS were recruited and completed the Post-Bariatric Surgery Appearance Questionnaire.The participants expressed the greatest dissatisfaction with the skin at the waist/abdomen and thigh regions. The most commonly contoured site was the waist/abdomen, and patients rated greater satisfaction with this body region after BCS. Few significant predictor variables were identified. A greater BMI at survey completion was independently associated with lower satisfaction with excess skin, and the time elapsed since BS predicted the desire for contouring.These findings underscore the importance of educating BS candidates about the issues with redundant skin after weight loss and the possible need for subsequent BCS. With this education, patients might have more realistic expectations concerning BS outcomes and be better positioned to seek BCS when indicated."
Experimental investigation on dwell-fatigue property of Ti每6Al每4V ELI used in deep-sea manned cabin,"Fang Wang, Weicheng Cui, ","Materials Science and Engineering: A, Volume 642, 26 August 2015, Pages 136-141, ","The deep-sea manned cabin endures dwell-fatigue loading process during service. The high strength titanium alloy Ti每6Al每4V ELI adopted for the manufacture manned cabin is of creep nature in the room temperature.

The strain accumulations under different loading conditions are reported. Results show that the strain accumulation behavior of the material under dwell-fatigue loading conditions are very similar to that under the condition of normal creep with three stages; and the increase in total strain with respect to number of cycles was much more pronounced for specimen at higher stress level, while the dwell time will affect strain accumulation when it is plotted versus cycles while strain accumulation tends to be similar in the abscissa of time for different dwell time under test. Based on the results, a dwell-fatigue life curve is derived based on the analysis, which can be applied in the material evaluation and service life estimation of the manned cabin."

Holmes, ","Developmental Brain Research, Volume 65, Issue 2, 21 February 1992, Pages 227-236, ","Acute and chronic effects of seizures induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of kainic acid (KA) were studied in developing rats (postnatal days (P) 5, 10, 20, 30, and adult 60). For 3 months following KA-induced status epilepticus, spontaneous recurrent seizure (SRS) occurrence was quantified using intermittent video monitoring. Latency to generalized seizures was then tested using flurothyl, and brains were histologically analyzed for CA3 lesions. In P5每10 rats, KA caused generalized tonic-clonic (＆swimming＊) seizures. SRS did not develop, and there was no significant difference between control and KA-treated rats in latency to flurothyl-induced seizures. In contrast, rats P20 and older exhibited limbic automatisms followed by limbic motor seizures which secondarily generalized. Incidence and frequency of SRS increased with age. P20每30 rats with SRS had shorter latencies to flurothyl seizures than did KA-treated P20每30 rats without SRS or controls. KA-treated P60 rats (with or without SRS) had shorter latencies than controls to flurothyl seizure onset. SRS in P60 rats occurred sooner after KA than in P20每30 rats. CA3 lesions were seen in P20每60 rats with and without SRS, but not in P5每10 rats. These data suggest that there are developmental differences in both acute and chronic responses to KA, with immature animals relatively protected from the long-term deleterious effects of this convulsant."
Influencing factors regression analysis of heating energy consumption of rural buildings in China,"Yanling Wang, Fang Wang, Haiyan Wang, ","Procedia Engineering, Volume 205, 2017, Pages 3585-3592, ","The heating energy consumption in rural residential buildings is increasing in recent years. The 181 influencing factors which influence heating energy consumption mainly includes five parts: family basic information, rural residential building features, building envelope information, indoor air quality in winter and building heating energy consumption. Multiple linear regression analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the significant factors which affect rural building heating energy. Suitable and validated multiple regression model can use less variables to describe, explain and predict the heat energy consumption of rural residential buildings. Comparing different multiple linear regression models, one interactive exponential model which has goodness of fit, less predictive relative error and less influencing factors is optimal. This exponential model can be applied to predict heating energy consumption and annual heating energy consumption of per degree-days heating area of rural buildings.Logistic regression analysis can predict heating energy consumption from high, medium or low probability prediction classification and can evaluate the heating energy consumption level. Two regression analysis methods present a reliable, valid, and economical instrument for in-depth rural building energy saving research."
APP Processing and Synaptic Plasticity in Presenilin-1 Conditional Knockout Mice,"Huakui Yu, Carlos A. Saura, Se-Young Choi, Linus D. Sun, Jie Shen, ","Neuron, Volume 31, Issue 5, 13 September 2001, Pages 713-726, ","We have developed a presenilin-1 (PS1) conditional knockout mouse (cKO), in which PS1 inactivation is restricted to the postnatal forebrain. The PS1 cKO mouse is viable and exhibits no gross abnormalities. The carboxy-terminal fragments of the amyloid precursor protein differentially accumulate in the cerebral cortex of cKO mice, while generation of 汕-amyloid peptides is reduced. Expression of Notch downstream effector genes, Hes1, Hes5, and Dll1, is unaffected in the cKO cortex. Although basal synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation, and long-term depression at hippocampal area CA1 synapses are normal, the PS1 cKO mice exhibit subtle but significant deficits in long-term spatial memory. These results demonstrate that inactivation of PS1 function in the adult cerebral cortex leads to reduced A汕 generation and subtle cognitive deficits without affecting expression of Notch downstream genes."

The velocity and temperature information transfers are fulfilled by a nonequilibrium extrapolation scheme. Pure FVM, pure LBM, and the coupled method with two different geometric settings are applied to solve the natural convection with different Rayleigh numbers. The results obtained from the coupled method agreed with those from pure FVM and LBM very well."

A detailed analysis of the relationship of IFT with temperature, pressure, and salinity was conducted. In addition, an empirical equation was developed to estimate the CO2每brine IFTs in a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and salt molality. The contact angles (CAs) of brine on quartz, Berea Sandstone, and limestone surfaces in the presence of supercritical, liquid, and gaseous CO2 were measured by using the sessile drop method, and the wettability alteration of the rock surfaces in the presence of supercritical CO2 was systematically investigated. According to the results, the CO2每brine IFTs increased with salinity and temperature and decreased with pressure until reaching a plateau. For a CO2每mixed brine system, a linear relationship between the IFT increase (忖污) and molality was observed. The CAs of the different rock samples varied with temperature and pressure.

Apelin-13-induced proliferation and migration induced of rat vascular smooth muscle cells is mediated by the upregulation of Egr-1,"Qi-Feng Liu, Hong-Wei Yu, Lu You, Ming-Xin Liu, Gui-Zhou Tao, ","Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Volume 439, Issue 2, 20 September 2013, Pages 235-240, ","Apelin-13 plays an important role in the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); however, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Egr-1 is a nuclear transcription factor, which is considered to be the critical initiating factor of the processes of VSMC proliferation and migration. Egr-1 is known to regulate the expression of osteopontin (OPN), which is a marker of the phenotypic modulation that is a necessary condition of VSMC proliferation and migration. We hypothesized that the role of Apelin-13 is mediated via upregulation of Egr-1. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effects of Apelin-13 treatment on Egr-1 mRNA and protein expression in A10 rat aortic VSMCs by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Results showed that, Apelin-13 upregulated the expression of Egr-1. Furthermore, treatment with the extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK) inhibitor, PD98059, inhibited the upregulation of Egr-1 by Apelin-13. In addition, this upregulation was inhibited by treatment of VSMCs with the Egr-1 specific deoxyribozyme ED5 (DNAenzyme/10-23 DRz). Furthermore, ED5 treatment was found to significantly inhibit Apelin-13-induced migration and proliferation of VSMCs using transwell and MTT assays, respectively. The evaluation of OPN mRNA and protein expression levels by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed that ED5 treatment also inhibited Apelin-13-induced OPN upregulation. The results of this study indicated that Apelin-13 upregulates Egr-1 via ERK. Furthermore, Apelin-13 induced the proliferation and migration of VSMCs as well as the upregulation of OPN via the upregulation of Egr-1. These results will provide an important theoretical and experimental basis for the control of inappropriate remodeling of vessel walls, and will hopefully lead to the prevention and treatment of vascular remodeling diseases."

Most injuries were due to fragmentation devices. Only 17% involved the kidney and none involved the ureter; 83% involved the pelvic organs and external genitalia. The majority of surgical procedures performed for these injuries were conservative (organ sparing). Anecdotal observations by the surgeons suggested that the use of the flak vest may have led to a shift away from abdominal injuries to injuries of the pelvis and genitalia.Conclusions: Urologic injuries in the Gulf War primarily involved the pelvis and genitalia and were frequently managed conservatively. The prevalence of fragmentation injuries and use of the flak vest may explain this observation."
Development of omnidirectional A0 mode EMAT employing a concentric permanent magnet pairs with opposite polarity for plate inspection,"Zenghua Liu, Yanan Hu, Muwen Xie, Bin Wu, Cunfu He, ","NDT & E International, Volume 94, March 2018, Pages 13-21, ","This work presents an omnidirectional electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) for generating and receiving A0 mode of Lamb waves in plate structures. The proposed EMAT is composed of a spiral meander coil (SMC) and a new concentric permanent magnet pairs with opposite polarity (CPMP-OP) for enhancing the generation and detection of A0 mode. A finite element model was established to simulate the directions of the static magnetic field produced by the permanent magnets and the incentive process of guided waves. To verify the performance of the EMAT, several experiments were performed. Firstly, we experimentally verified that the developed EMAT could generate and receive a pure single A0 mode omnidirectionally. Then, the relationship between the frequency response characteristic of the developed EMAT and the interval l (the distance between the two adjacent annular wires of the SMC) were explored. Furthermore, the circumferential consistency of the transducer was well demonstrated. Finally, the sensing performance of the developed omnidirectional A0 mode EMAT employing a CPMP-OP was compared with that of EMAT with different structures of coils and permanent magnets. The experimental results indicated that the developed omnidirectional A0 mode EMAT employing a CPMP-OP could enhance the signals of the A0 mode."

The exponential model is used to simulate the inhomogeneous electro-mechanical properties of the FGPMs coating. The conducting spherical punch with a constant surface electric potential is considered in the contact. A normal force and a cyclic torque are applied to the two contact bodies. The applied torque produces an outer annular slip area and an inner stick area. The torsion angle is produced within the inner stick area as a rigid body. With the aid of the Hankel integral transform technique, we can reduce the contact problem to the singular integral equations of the Cauchy type. Then the unknown electro-mechanical fields and stick/slip area can be obtained numerically. The effect of the gradient index on the surface electro-mechanical fields is discussed at loading and unloading phases. The Mises stress and principal stress at the contact surface are also discussed to predict the possible location of fretting damage and failure."

"Cell-type specificity of ectonucleotidase expression and upregulation by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin","Emily Wood, M Johan Broekman, Terence L Kirley, Silvia Diani-Moore, Arleen B Rifkind, ","Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Volume 407, Issue 1, 1 November 2002, Pages 49-62, ","We report here that induction of ectoATPase by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is cell-type specific and not a generalized response to aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor activation. TCDD increased [14C]-ATP and -ADP metabolism in two mouse hepatoma lines, Hepa1c1c7 and Hepa1-6 cells, but not in human hepatoma HepG2 or HuH-7 cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), chick hepatoma (LMH) cells, or chick primary hepatocytes or cardiac myocytes, even though all of those cell types were Ah receptor-responsive, as evidenced by cytochrome P4501A induction. To determine whether the differences in ectonucleotidase responsiveness to TCDD might be related to differences in cell-type ectonucleotidase expression, ATP and ADP metabolite patterns, the products of several classes of ectonucleotidases including ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (E-NTPDases), ectophosphodiesterase/pyrophosphatases (E-NPP enzymes) and ectoalkaline phosphatase activities were examined. Those patterns, together with results of enzyme assays, Western blotting, or semiquantitative RT每PCR show that NTPDase2 is the main ectonucleotidase for murine and human hepatoma cells, NTPDase3 for chick hepatocytes and LMH cells, and an E-NPP enzyme for chick cardiac myocytes. Evidence for NTPDase2 expression was lacking in all cells except the mouse and human hepatoma cells. TCDD increased expression of the NTPDase2 gene but only in the mouse and not in the human hepatoma cells. TCDD did not increase NTPDase3, NTPDase1, E-NPP, or alkaline phosphatase in any of the cell types examined. The failure of TCDD to increase ATP metabolism in HUVEC, chick LMH cells, hepatocytes, and cardiac myocytes can be attributed to their lack of NTPDase2 expression, while the increase in ATP metabolism by TCDD in the mouse but not the human hepatoma cells can be explained by differences in TCDD effects on mouse and human hepatoma NTPDase2 gene expression. In addition to characterizing effects of TCDD on ectonucleotidases, these studies reveal major differences in the complements of ectonucleotidases present in different cell types. It is likely that such differences are important for cell-specific susceptibility to extracellular nucleotide toxicity and responses to purinergic signaling."
Horizontal resolution and data density effects on remotely sensed LIDAR-based DEM,"Eric S. Anderson, James A. Thompson, David A. Crouse, Rob E.

Light detecting and ranging (LIDAR) elevation data sets provide the flexibility needed to produce multiple horizontal resolutions of DEM from the same data source. A series of 61 LIDAR tiles (100 ha) were collected from the North Carolina Flood Mapping Program covering the spatial extent of the Hofmann Forest in the Lower Coastal Plain of Eastern North Carolina. The LIDAR data set was reduced to 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, and 1% of the original density. We created 5-, 10-, and 30-m DEM with 0.1 m vertical precision for each density level and used paired t-test to determine if the true mean of their differences were equal to zero. Differences indicated that for the 30-m DEM, LIDAR data sets could be reduced to 10% of their original data density without statistically altering the produced DEM. However, the 10-m DEM could only be reduced to 25% of the original data set before statistically altering the DEM. Data reduction was more limited for the 5-m DEM with possible reduction only to 50% of their original density without producing statistically different DEM. Our evaluation provides some indication as to the minimum required LIDAR data density to produce a DEM of a given horizontal resolution. However, evaluation of additional horizontal resolutions and additional density reduction is required to provide a clearer understanding of the effect of LIDAR data density."

The results show that double-diffusive convection develops from steady-state convection-dominated, periodic oscillatory, quasi-periodic oscillatory to chaotic flow, and finally return to periodic oscillation as buoyancy ratio increases. Moreover, fundamental frequency and fluctuation amplitude increase with buoyancy ratio. As Rayleigh number increases, transition trendy of oscillatory convection is similar to that of buoyancy ratio. But the return of periodic oscillation from chaos is not obtained as Rayleigh number increases. As aspect ratio decreases, the oscillatory convection evolves from periodic into steady-state. In addition, fundamental frequency increases at first and then decreases while fluctuation amplitude decreases with aspect ratio."

Single-image super-resolution with joint-optimization of TV regularization and sparse representation,"Jinzheng Lu, Bin Wu, ","Optik - International Journal for Light and Electron Optics, Volume 125, Issue 11, June 2014, Pages 2497-2504, ","A super-resolution (SR) reconstruction framework is proposed using regularization restoration combined with learning-based resolution enhancement via sparse representation. With the viewpoint of conventional learning methods, the original image can be split into low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) components. The reconstruction mainly focuses on the process of HF part, while the LF one is founded simply by typical interpolation function. For the severely blurred single-image, we first use regularization restoration technology to recover it. Then the regularized output remarkably betters the quality of LF used in traditional learning-based methods. Last, image resolution enhancement with characteristic of edge preserving can implement based on the acquired relatively sharp intermediate image and the pre-constructed over-complete dictionary for sparse representation. Specifically, the regularization can favorably weaken the dependence of atoms on the course of degradation. With both techniques, we can noticeably eliminate the blur and the edge artifacts in the enlarged image simultaneously. Various experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can produce visually pleasing resolution for severely blurred image."
Sumoylation modulates 20-hydroxyecdysone signaling by maintaining USP protein levels in Drosophila,"Jiawan Wang, Sheng Wang, Sheng Li, ","Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Volume 54, November 2014, Pages 80-88, ","The nuclear receptor complex for the insect steroid hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), is a heterodimer of EcR and USP. It has been shown that Drosophila EcR and USP can be sumoylated in mammalian cells, but it is unknown whether EcR-USP sumoylation naturally occurs in Drosophila. In Drosophila cells, USP, but not EcR, was sumoylated by Smt3, the only Drosophila SUMO protein. The presence of EcR enhanced USP sumoylation, which is further enhanced by 20E treatment. In addition to the Lys20 sumoylation site, five potential acceptor lysine residues in USP were predicted and verified. Mutation of the USP sumoylation sites or reduction of smt3 expression by RNAi attenuated 20E-induced reporter activity. Moreover, in the salivary glands, reducing smt3 expression by RNAi decreased 20E-induced reporter activity, gene expression, and autolysosome formation. Importantly, at least partially, the smt3 RNAi-mediated reduction in 20E signaling resulted from decreased protein levels of USP. In conclusion, sumoylation modulates 20E signaling by maintaining USP protein levels in Drosophila.Download high-res image (77KB)Download full-size image"
An evolutionary analysis of low-carbon strategies based on the government每enterprise game in the complex network context,"Bin Wu, Pengfei Liu, Xuefei Xu, ","Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 141, 10 January 2017, Pages 168-179, ","Low-carbon development patterns have gradually attracted more attention because of strong shocks to society and the economy from environmental problems. Developing a low-carbon economy is essential for every country to improve sustainable economic development, and doing so is at the forefront of low-carbon research. Policy and government intervention play a key role in the development of a low-carbon economy. Using game-based learning theory for reference, this paper builds an evolutionary model of low-carbon strategies based on the game between the government and enterprises in the context of a complex network. It then studies the effects of government incentives on enterprises regarding the diffusion of low-carbon policies and how enterprises compete and transform in the Newman-Watts small-world network. We introduce government policy encouragement as a factor in the decision-making process of companies' adoption of a low-carbon strategy, thus enriching the literature on the diffusion of low-carbon strategies. The model proposed in this paper can be used as a tool to evaluate the diffusion and application of low-carbon strategies among companies. The findings suggest that enterprises＊ expectation of government incentives including subsidy and regulation determines whether low-carbon strategies can be diffused, and the diffusion speed. The more quick enterprises adjust their expectations in the government每enterprise game, the more enterprises will learn and follow to adopt effective low-carbon strategy.

The crystal structure and morphology of samples were characterized and analyzed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Photoluminescence properties of CaMoO4:Tb3+, Sm3+ and energy transfer from Tb3+ to Sm3+ have been studied in detail. It was found the emitting color of the phosphors could be tuned between green and red by changing the doping concentration of Tb3+/Sm3+, and the color also changed with different excitation wavelength under the same concentration. The average fluorescent lifetime of Tb3+ at 5D4 energy level, energy transfer efficiency and rate from Tb3+ to Sm3+ in CaMoO4 host were calculated. The energy transfer mechanism between Tb3+ and Sm3+ was confirmed to be electric dipole-dipole interaction."
Yield and efficacy of biopty gun testis needle biopsy,"Allen F Morey, Michael F MacDonald, Thomas A Rozanski, Sridhar Natarajan, Ian M Thompson, ","Urology, Volume 53, Issue 3, March 1999, Pages 604-607, ","Objectives. To assess whether a preliminary skin incision enhances diagnostic yield of percutaneous testis biopsy and to further evaluate the clinical efficacy of this procedure.Methods. A total of 45 men (67 testes) underwent testicular biopsy with two passes of a Biopty gun spring-loaded needle. Twenty-seven biopsies were performed without a preliminary skin incision (group 1), and 40 were performed after a small scrotal incision (group 2). In 56 testes, needle biopsy histopathologic diagnosis was compared with that of open biopsy or orchiectomy specimens from the same patient. Needle and surgical specimens were fixed in Bouin＊s solution and sent separately for independent, blinded, histologic interpretation.Results. Complications of the procedure were negligible. In all 67 needle biopsies, specimen quality was adequate for histopathologic interpretation. The mean number of seminiferous tubules obtained from needle biopsy was 28% higher among patients having a preliminary skin incision (25.9) compared with those without (18.7, P = 0.023). Correlation between needle and open histopathologic diagnosis was excellent (55 of 56, 98%).Conclusions. A preliminary skin incision made before needle biopsy increases the diagnostic yield of percutaneous testis biopsy. Percutaneous testis biopsy using the Biopty gun needle provides equal diagnostic information when compared with open testis biopsy or orchiectomy specimens. The concomitant reduction in morbidity and cost make this an attractive diagnostic procedure."

Stimuli-responsive and micellar behaviors of star-shaped poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate]-b-poly[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl methacrylate] with a 汕-cyclodextrin core,"Yi Guo, Meng Li, Xinrui Li, Yazhuo Shang, Honglai Liu, ","Reactive and Functional Polymers, Volume 116, July 2017, Pages 77-86, ","A series of star-shaped block copolymers (CDPDPM) of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl methacrylate (MEO2MA) with tunable stimuli-responsive behavior are synthesized via sequential atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) with the 2-bromoisobutyryl-terminated 汕-cyclodextrin (汕-CD) as a core. The properties of these star-shaped copolymers are characterized by FT-IR, NMR and GPC analyses. Meanwhile, the thermo-sensitive behaviors of CDPDPM with different compositions and pH values are investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV每vis measurements. The results have shown that the synthesized polymer CDPDPM exhibits both pH- and thermo-responsive behaviors in aqueous solutions. The star-shaped copolymers with the nearly equal mole fraction of DMAEMA and MEO2MA show two-step thermo-induced aggregation behavior in water at a pH near the isoelectric point (IEP), which corresponds to the formation of branch aggregates and large aggregates consisting of clustered branch aggregates, respectively. The mole fraction of DMAEMA and MEO2MA in polymer affects the thermal-responsive behaviors of polymer itself. Moreover, the micellar behaviors of the synthesized copolymers in aqueous solution are explored. The aggregation process of the copolymer can be generalized into intramolecular aggregation of the hydrophobic chains (corresponding to CI), formation of premicelles, the aggregation and rearrangement of the premicelles (namely CMC), as well as the formation of multicore structures. The CI and CMC values depend on both the MEO2MA molar fraction and the carbon backbone length of polymers. The aggregation number (N) and the sizes of polymer micelles (Dh) vary with the polymer composition, polymer concentration and ambient environment."
Gene expression profile of human lymphoid CEM cells sensitive and resistant to glucocorticoid-evoked apoptosis,"Rheem D Medh, M. Scott Webb, Aaron L Miller, Betty H Johnson, E. Brad Thompson, ","Genomics, Volume 81, Issue 6, June 2003, Pages 543-555, ","Three closely related clones of leukemic lymphoid CEM cells were compared for their gene expression responses to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex). All three contained receptors for Dex, but only two responded by undergoing apoptosis. After a time of exposure to Dex that ended late in the interval preceding onset of apoptosis, gene microarray analyses were carried out. The results indicate that the expression of a limited, distinctive set of genes was altered in the two apoptosis-prone clones, not in the resistant clone. That clone showed altered expression of different sets of genes, suggesting that a molecular switch converted patterns of gene expression between the two phenotypes: apoptosis-prone and apoptosis-resistant. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that altered expression of a distinctive network of genes after glucocorticoid administration ultimately triggers apoptosis of leukemic lymphoid cells. The altered genes identified provide new foci for study of their role in cell death."
Proteomic Analysis of Cucumber Defense Responses Induced by Propamocarb,"Peng WU, Zhi-wei QIN, Tao WU, Xiu-yan ZHOU, Qian-qian GUO, ","Journal of Integrative Agriculture, Volume 12, Issue 11, November 2013, Pages 2022-2035, ","Propamocarb is an agricultural chemical that has been widely used to protect cucumber plants from downy mildew. To understand the mechanisms of cucumber defense responses to propamocarb, we investigated the physiological and proteomic responses of the cucumber line D0351 with propamocarb application. We found that after treatment with propamocarb, the activities of detoxifying enzymes (glutathione reductase, GR; glutathione S-tramsferase, GST) and soluble sugar content of cucumber fruit were significantly increased, but malonaldehyde (MDA) content was significantly reduced. To identify components of propamocarb responsive signaling, we compared the high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) protein profiles of control and propamocarb-treated fruits, and identified 18 differentially expressed (13 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated) proteins induced by propamocarb which were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The majority of the proteins had functions related to detoxication, energy and transport, protein biosynthesis, regulating reactions and defending against stresses. A real-time quantitative reverse transcriptional-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to compare transcript and protein accumulation patterns for 18 candidate proteins, and the expression of 14 was consistent at both transcript and protein levels. The responses of cucumber proteome to propamocarb seemed complex; the identified proteins may play an important role in regulating adaptation activities following exposure to propamocarb. Data presented herein may shed light on understanding cucumber fruit defense responses under propamocarb treatment."

The two streams flow in a countercurrent configuration on opposite sides of the membrane. The neutral pH of the analytical stream promotes the formation of ammonium cations, which are detected using specific conductance. The methodology provides a lower limit of detection of 10 米g/L and a dynamic concentration range spanning three orders of magnitude using a 315-米L sample injection volume. Using immobilized urease to enzymatically promote the hydrolysis of urea to produce ammonia and carbon dioxide, the technique has been extended to the determination of urea."
Virtual musculoskeletal control model with a spindle-like fuzzy algorithm for robotic compliance,"Dong Xu, Shaoguang Zhang, Hongxing Wei, ","Applied Mathematical Modelling, Volume 39, Issue 12, 15 June 2015, Pages 3265-3279, ","Robot manipulators should comply with the environment when working with humans. However, compliance control is a difficult problem for robots and thus it was investigated in the present study. We propose a virtual musculoskeletal control model from the perspective of bionics to facilitate the compliance of the robotic manipulator. The musculoskeletal system of the human forearm is simplified as a closed-loop control system with three parts: the central nervous system, muscles, and spindle. A mathematical model is deduced and integrated with the dynamic model of the robot manipulator. The control model also comprises three parts: the first part compensates for the Coriolis force and gravity; the second part provides stiffness to regulate the deviation; and the third part imitates the feedback from the spindle to comply with the environment. A fuzzy controller is designed based on the muscle and spindle model to obtain spindle-like feedback. Our simulation results demonstrate that the spindle-like fuzzy algorithm can adapt to the environmental constraints by imitating the function of the neural muscular system. This virtual musculoskeletal methodology allows accurate path control, but it also ensures the compliance of the robotic manipulator. These characteristics are helpful for allowing robot manipulators to cooperate with humans."

In this paper, the results of horizontal and vertical property tests are presented first and then effects of excitation frequency, displacement on MHEID are studied. In order to consider the effects of excitation frequency, displacement amplitude and temperature on MHEID, a new mathematical model, i.e., fractional-derivative equivalent standard solid model, is put forward to describe the dynamic properties of MHEID precisely in both horizontal and vertical directions. Then, horizontal and vertical pseudo-dynamic tests on structures with and without MHEID are conducted. It can be seen from the experimental results that MHEID can obviously reduce the displacement responses, acceleration responses and input forces of the long-span reticulate structure. In order to analyze the earthquake isolation effect of MHEID on long-span reticulate structures, the dynamic responses are simulated by using a new dynamic response analysis method. The numerical results fit well with the experimental results and it is indicated that the proposed method can simulate the dynamic responses of the long-span reticulate structure."
Robust discriminative tracking via structured prior regularization,"Yuanhao Yu, Qingsong Wu, T. Kirubarajan, Yasuo Uehara, ","Image and Vision Computing, Volume 69, January 2018, Pages 68-80, ","In this paper, we address the problem of tracking an object in a video sequence given its location in the first frame and no other information. Many existing discriminative tracking algorithms usually train a classifier in an on-line manner to separate the object of interest from the background. Slight inaccuracies in the tracking may result in incorrectly labelled training set, which can degrade the tracker. Although a number of approaches such as semi-supervised learning and multiple instance learning have been developed to address this problem, some critical issues still remain unsolved. This work aims to mitigate the shortcomings by exploiting a reliable generative model to support the discriminative learning process. A prior model based on a set of structured Dirichlet-multinomial distributions is proposed to preserve the target's structure information. This prior is then formulated as a regularization term in a training objective function, which casts the tracking task as a prior regularized semi-supervised learning problem. A multi-objective optimization method is developed to search for the solution, taking advantage of a decision maker inside to control the conflicts between different modules. The experiments show that this proposed method outperforms standard algorithms on challenging datasets. It is also demonstrated that the algorithm significantly mitigates the error accumulation effect."

The optimized roof solar chimney consists of a glazed panel, a gap, a perforated absorber plate, and an absorber wall. Three-dimensional numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the heat transfer and fluid flow in the roof solar chimney at different gap widths and inclination angles. Mass flow rate, velocity profile, and temperature distribution in the roof solar chimney were presented. In the meantime, the comparisons of ventilation performance between the optimized configuration and the traditional roof solar chimney were performed. The perforated absorber plate, which divided the roof solar chimney into two channels and heated the air in the gap, increases the pressure head and the temperature difference between the ambient and inside air to augment the natural ventilation. The mass flow rate of the proposed optimized roof solar chimney is higher than that of the traditional roof solar chimney. It is also found that the optimization techniques using perforated absorber plate fitted in the air gap are more effective for the roof solar chimney with larger inclination angle and gap width.Sketch of the optimized roof solar chimney.Download high-res image (55KB)Download full-size image"

The apoptosis of Staphylococcus aureus induced by glycinin basic peptide through ROS oxidative stress response,"Hou-Qi Ning, Ying-Qiu Li, Qi-Wen Tian, Zhao-Sheng Wang, Hai-Zhen Mo, ","LWT, In press, accepted manuscript, Available online 12 September 2018, ","This study aimed to investigate the antibacterial mechanism of glycinin basic peptide (GBP) against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Scanning electron microscope showed GBP treatment disrupted the integrity of S. aureus cells. And the leakages of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions from bacterial cells further confirmed the membrane disruption by GBP. The electrophoresis of bacterial proteins and circular dichroism spectrum of bacterial DNA indicated GBP treatment caused the stress response of S. aureus and destroyed the bacterial DNA structure. Moreover, the results of DNA gel electrophoresis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis analysis demonstrated the antibacterial mechanism of GBP was a result of increased intracellular ROS and blunted adaptive oxidative stress response in S. aureus. The excessive oxidative stress response ultimately led to the bacterial cell apoptosis. These suggested GBP mainly induced the cellular death of S. aureus by membrane disruption and ROS-mediated apoptosis pathway.Download high-res image (274KB)Download full-size image"

Microinjection with calpastatin completely prevented fusion of myoblasts from both sources, whereas microinjection with m-calpain significantly increased the rate of fusion of cultured RSC; 44% of the nuclei of RSC cultures were in multinucleated myotubes within 48 h after microinjection with m-calpain plus labeled dextran, whereas only 15% of the nuclei were in multinucleated myotubes after microinjection with dextran alone. Western analyses indicated that neither RSC nor C2C12myoblasts contained detectable amounts of 米-calpain before fusion. The levels of calpastatin in C2C12myoblasts increased as cells passed from the proliferative stage to the onset of fusion, and these levels increased substantially in both the C2C12and the RSC cells as they progressed to the late or postfusion stage. Both RSC and C2C12myoblasts contained an 80-kDa polypeptide that was labeled with an anti-m-calpain antibody in Western blots. The results are consistent with a role of the calpain system (m-calpain in these myoblast lines) in remodeling of the cytoskeletal/plasma membrane interactions during cell fusion."

Determining attribute weights for multiple attribute decision analysis with discriminating power in belief distributions,"Chao Fu, Dong-Ling Xu, Min Xue, ","Knowledge-Based Systems, Volume 143, 1 March 2018, Pages 127-141, ","Attribute weight assignment plays an important role in multiple attribute decision analysis (MADA). When the performances of alternatives on each attribute are expressed by distributions instead of single values, how to use the differences among the performances to obtain attribute weights is an interesting but difficult issue. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a method for obtaining attribute weights from discriminating power in belief distributions. With the consideration of the differences among the utilities of all assessment grades used to profile belief distributions, the dissimilarity based discriminating power, the standard deviation based discriminating power and the Gini's mean difference based discriminating power of the performances of all alternatives on each attribute are constructed to determine three sets of respective weights of attributes. They are convexly combined using three coefficients to generate integrated weights of attributes. To relieve the burden on a decision maker to provide precise values for the three coefficients, they are allowed to change between 0 and 1, as long as their sum is equal to 1. Under such constraints on the three coefficients, an optimization model is constructed to determine the minimum and maximum expected utilities of each alternative. From the expected utilities, all alternatives are then compared using Hurwicz rule with the provided optimism degree interval to generate solutions to MADA problems. The transitivity of the comparison outcomes among three alternatives under a given optimism degree interval is theoretically analyzed to guarantee the rationality of the outcomes. A focal form selection problem is investigated to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed method."
DedupDUM: Secure and scalable data deduplication with dynamic user management,"Haoran Yuan, Xiaofeng Chen, Tao Jiang, Xiaoyu Zhang, Yang Xiang, ","Information Sciences, Volume 456, August 2018, Pages 159-173, ","Data deduplication on cloud enables the cloud servers to store a cope of data and eliminate redundant one so that a goal to save storage space and network bandwidth is realized.

However, to our knowledge, the existing schemes are not efficient when the cloud user joining and revocation frequently go on, especially in the absence of a trusted third party in practical cloud storage systems. In this paper, we propose a secure and scalable data deduplication scheme with dynamic user management, which updates dynamic group users in a secure way and restricts the unauthorized cloud users from the sensitive data owned by valid users. To further mitigate the communication overhead, the pre-verified accessing control technology is adopted, which prevents the unauthorized cloud users from downloading data. In other words, our present scheme also ensures that only the valid cloud users are able to download and decrypt the ciphertext from the cloud server. All this reduces the communication overhead in our scheme implementation."

It is demonstrated easily in a variety of in vitro systems, but its confirmation in vivo is made with difficulty. In various single cell organisms, chemotaxis can be construed as serving (a) to enable the organism to collect where food is available, (b) to avoid noxious materials, (c) to facilitate the aggregation of organisms so that more complex structures can be created, (d) to facilitate the dispersion of organisms for the optimal use of environmental resources, and (e) to aid in fertilization. Leukocyte chemotaxis is incited by a wide variety of agents, including bacteria and bacterial filtrates, starch granules, casein, and peptone〞none of which seem to require complement〞 and by an even longer list of materials that, when incubated with normal serum, yield chemotactic responses perhaps dependent to a greater or lesser degree on the presence of complement."

SRS rate over the next 4 weeks, as assessed by intermittent video monitoring, was significantly lower in MK801 treated rats than in those which received KA alone. In addition, fewer MK801 treated rats (43%) developed SRS than those which got KA alone (88%). Susceptibility to generalized seizures was then tested using the volatile convulsant flurothyl; at both doses of MK801, flurothyl seizure latency was significantly greater in pretreated animals. These results show that MK801 pretreatment prior to KA induced status epilepticus reduces subsequent SRS frequency and flurothyl seizure susceptibility, while not substantially altering the acute epileptogenic effects of KA."

The results show how the overlay coating structure has an effect on the cavitation resistance of the Sn-based coatings studied, as the multilayered Sn-based overlay coating exhibited a significantly enhanced resistance to cavitation erosion compared with monolayered Sn-based overlay coatings."
Chapter 10: Antibiotics Derived From Marine Organisms: Their Chemistry and Biological Mode of Action,"Bibi Nazia Auckloo, Bin Wu, ","Studies in Natural Products Chemistry, Volume 51, 2016, Pages 483-515, ","The marine biosphere offers a wide range of invaluable and unique compounds which possess diverse biological properties, among which are antitumor, anticancer, antimicrobial, antithrombotic, anti-inflammation etc. A great number of natural products originate directly from marine animals such as sponges, cnidarians, and mollusks while some arise from microbes like bacteria or fungi which are linked to other organisms or dwell in marine sediment. Nevertheless, a huge number of marine microorganisms producing significant natural products have long been underexplored due to the difficulty in their cultivation and isolation in the laboratory. Microorganisms striving under specific circumstances such as extreme variations in temperature, pressure, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients availability generate antimicrobial or antibiotics having vast inhibitory potential against harmful gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. Antibiotics produced by different marine organisms belong to various chemical classes including protein, polypeptides, lipopeptides, thiopeptides, dicarboxylic acids, macrolactones etc. Moreover, it is of great interest for scientists to be able to depict the mode of action of antibiotics against pathogens which will permit them to fortify its ability to kill or disrupt its target without any side effects. For instance, cell membrane interruption and permeation, adenosine triphosphate and RNA suppression as well as DNA degradation are factors promoting bacterial death. However, a major threat to humanity which is on the top priority list worldwide is the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics which is drastically increasing the rate of patients with infectious diseases. As a result, it has become a necessity for researchers to make the most out of the newest technologies, methodologies, expertise, as well as the intensification of international collaboration for advanced investigation on marine organisms producing antibiotics. The chapter will focus mainly on the antibiotics produced by marine organisms, its related chemistry as well as its mechanism of action."
Impact of destination familiarity on external information source selection process,"Dogan Gursoy, Giacomo Del Chiappa, Yi Zhang, ","Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, Volume 8, June 2018, Pages 137-146, ","Utilizing a conjoint analysis approach, this study aims to examine the impact of destination familiarity on the relative importance of external information sources for domestic and international travelers during the pre-purchase information search process. Data for this study were collected from 719 tourists traveling to Sardinia (Italy). Findings reveal that the level of destination familiarity is a critical determinant of the importance domestic and international travelers attach to different external information source categories and related sub-categories. For example, the online personal information sources category is found to be the most important for domestic travelers with low destination familiarity while the personal information sources category is the most important information source category for international travelers with low destination familiarity. Contradicting the general belief that the social networking sites such as Facebook plays a critical role in individuals＊ consumption behavior, findings suggest that the social networking sites are not that influential when it comes to travel and destination selection decisions. Both theoretical and practical contributions of this study to the literature and managerial implications are discussed, and suggestions for further research are provided."
Sparse array extension for non-circular signals with subspace and compressive sensing based DOA estimation methods,"Jingjing Cai, Wei Liu, Ru Zong, Bin Wu, ","Signal Processing, Volume 145, April 2018, Pages 59-67, ","The virtual array generation process based on typical sparse arrays is studied for a mixture of circular and non-circular impinging signals. It consists of two sub-arrays: one is the traditional difference co-array and the other one is the new sum co-array. The number of consecutive virtual array sensors is analysed for the nested array case, but it is difficult to give a closed-form result for a general sparse array. Based on the extended covariance matrix of the physical array, two classes of direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms are then developed, with one based on the subspace method and one based on sparse representation or the compressive sensing (CS) concept. Both the consecutive and non-consecutive parts of the virtual array can be exploited by the CS-based method, while only the consecutive part can be exploited by the subspace-based one. As a result, the CS-based solution can have a better performance than the subspace-based one, though at the cost of significantly increased computational complexity. The two classes of algorithms can also deal with the special case when all the signals are noncircular. Simulation results are provided to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms."

An adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing a small human G6Pase transgene was pseudotyped with AAV8 (AAV2/8) to optimize liver tropism. Survival was prolonged in 2-week-old G6Pase (每/每) mice by 600-fold fewer AAV2/8 vector particles (vp), in comparison to previous experiments involving this model (2 ℅ 109 vp; 3 ℅ 1011 vp/kg). When the vector was pseudotyped with AAV1, survival was prolonged only at a higher dose (3 ℅ 1013 vp/kg). The AAV2/8 vector uniquely prevented hypoglycemia during fasting and fully corrected liver G6Pase deficiency in GSD-Ia mice and dogs. The AAV2/8 vector has prolonged survival in three GSD-Ia dogs to >11 months, which validated this strategy in the large animal model for GSD-Ia. Urinary biomarkers, including lactate and 3-hydroxybutyrate, were corrected by G6Pase expression solely in the liver. Glycogen accumulation in the liver was reduced almost to the normal level in vector-treated GSD-Ia mice and dogs, as was the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in GSD-Ia mice. These preclinical data demonstrated the efficacy of correcting hepatic G6Pase deficiency, and support the further preclinical development of AAV vector每mediated gene therapy for GSD-Ia."

The proposed methodology includes three screening criteria to serve as guidelines for assessing CO2 storage. The absence of thorough, comprehensive geologic and petrophysical data for unconventional shale reservoirs is noted as a significant limitation and source of uncertainty in estimating CO2 storage resource. Future work is aimed towards analyzing geologic data from organic-rich shale in order to refine the methodology and reduce the uncertainty associated with CO2 storage in these complex formations."
"Geospatial analysis for utilizing the marginal land in regional biofuel industry: A case study in Guangdong Province, China","Fang Wang, Xun Shi, ","Biomass and Bioenergy, Volume 83, December 2015, Pages 302-310, ","Due to the intensive and exhaustive land use in China, the so-called marginal land is expected to play a major role in supporting the biofuel industry of the country. We developed a regional-level framework of using geospatial information technologies to achieve an optimal utilization of the marginal land for biofuel production. The framework includes identifying marginal lands, evaluating optimality of the land for growing certain bioenergy crops, estimating local potential feedstock production, and finally selecting optimal sites for biofuel factories. We present a case study of farming Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) and Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) in Guangdong, China. The marginal land was identified from satellite imageries at a 30-m resolution. The optimality for growing the two species was evaluated using the Ecological Niche Models (ENMs), which incorporates local temperature, precipitation, soil, and terrain. The optimality value was then converted into potential feedstock production using a conversion model. The site selection for the factories incorporated the local potential feedstock production, the transportation cost measured by road distance, and the farming cost related to the land patch geometry. Each candidate site received an overall optimality score derived based on those factors. We identified five sites that have high scores and also minimal or none spatial overlaps of their supporting areas. Three of them (Zhanjiang, Yunfu, and Jieyang) are for Cassava, located on in southern Guangdong. Two (Qingyuan and Meizhou) are for Jatropha in northern Guangdong."

Compositional segmentation of time series in the financial markets,"Yi Yin, Pengjian Shang, Jianan Xia, ","Applied Mathematics and Computation, Volume 268, 1 October 2015, Pages 399-412, ","We introduce an entropic segmentation algorithm and apply it to decompose the financial sequences into compositionally homogeneous domains. To probe more about the nature of the financial time series, we investigate the statistical properties of the segment from the view of segmentation position and segment length first. We reveal some important and interesting conclusions and information hidden in these time series of stock markets. Then, we focus on the study of the intrinsic properties for each segment in the time series from two aspects: time irreversibility and correlation. The fluctuations on the time irreversibility and the scaling exponent all support that the segments present compositional heterogeneity and verify the segmentation. Meanwhile, we conclude that time irreversibility is inherent in the stock time series and verifies that stock markets are nonequilibrium systems essentially even though segmentation. Moreover, the scaling exponents for each segment point out that the traditional detrended fluctuation analysis is not applicable to measure the correlation for the whole original time series of stock market."

Urban每rural income change: Influences of landscape pattern and administrative spatial spillover effect,"Chen Zeng, Yan Song, Qingsong He, Yu Liu, ","Applied Geography, Volume 97, August 2018, Pages 248-262, ","China is experiencing unprecedented urbanisation, and urban每rural livelihood is transforming in various ways, with urban每rural income being a representative aspect. In this context, we raised two issues that are related to our study on the changes in urban and rural income and the related influencing factors, that is, whether landscape pattern affects urban每rural income and whether different spatial adjacencies generate various impacts on urban每rural income. We incorporated landscape pattern indicators and the administrative spatial spillover effect into a spatial regression model to address these issues using the Wuhan agglomeration as an example. We used aggregation indexes (AI) and the proportion of other construction lands (CLP) to represent landscape patterns. Then, multiple strategies were used to accommodate different spatial adjacency situations at the county level by introducing the magnified spatial factor for strengthening specific scenarios of spatial interactions. Results revealed that AI and CLP showed a remarkable relationship with per capita urban disposable income (UDI), but CLP was more powerful than AI in affecting per capita rural net income (RNI). Spatiotemporal differences were observed in urban每rural incomes, and an administrative spatial spillover effect was observed in the period of 2005每2015. The most powerful spatial interaction emerged when urban districts were neighbours for UDI and when a county-level city, a suburban district and a county were neighbours for RNI in 2005 and 2015. Coupled with urbanisation and urban每rural integration, the administrative spillover effect weakened for UDI and functioned varyingly for RNI. These results reaffirmed the influence of urbanisation and economic development on urban每rural income, and regional disparity is expected be considered when corresponding policy implications are made in the future."

Simultaneous measurements of more than one doublet vs relative density show that the decrease in the total integrated intensities is not due to vapor pressure effects."
Improving the Physical Realism and Structural Accuracy of Protein Models by a Two-Step Atomic-Level Energy Minimization,"Dong Xu, Yang Zhang, ","Biophysical Journal, Volume 101, Issue 10, 16 November 2011, Pages 2525-2534, ","Most protein structural prediction algorithms assemble structures as reduced models that represent amino acids by a reduced number of atoms to speed up the conformational search. Building accurate full-atom models from these reduced models is a necessary step toward a detailed function analysis. However, it is difficult to ensure that the atomic models retain the desired global topology while maintaining a sound local atomic geometry because the reduced models often have unphysical local distortions. To address this issue, we developed a new program, called ModRefiner, to construct and refine protein structures from C汐 traces based on a two-step, atomic-level energy minimization. The main-chain structures are first constructed from initial C汐 traces and the side-chain rotamers are then refined together with the backbone atoms with the use of a composite physics- and knowledge-based force field. We tested the method by performing an atomic structure refinement of 261 proteins with the initial models constructed from both ab initio and template-based structure assemblies. Compared with other state-of-art programs, ModRefiner shows improvements in both global and local structures, which have more accurate side-chain positions, better hydrogen-bonding networks, and fewer atomic overlaps.

Expectile regression for analyzing heteroscedasticity in high dimension,"Jun Zhao, Yingyu Chen, Yi Zhang, ","Statistics & Probability Letters, Volume 137, June 2018, Pages 304-311, ","High-dimensional data often display heteroscedasticity and this feature has attracted a lot of attention and discussion. In this paper, we propose regularized expectile regression with SCAD penalty for analyzing heteroscedasticity in high dimension when the error has finite moments. Since the corresponding optimization problem is nonconvex due to the SCAD penalty, we adopt the CCCP (coupling of the concave and convex procedure) algorithm to solve this problem. Under some regular conditions, we can prove that with probability tending to one, the proposed algorithm converges to the oracle estimator after several iterations. We should address that the higher order moment the error has, the higher dimension cardinality our procedure can handle with. If the error follows gaussian or sub-gaussian distribution, our method can be extended to deal with ultra high-dimensional data. Furthermore, by taking different expectile weight level 汐, we are able to detect heteroscedasticity and explore the entire conditional distribution of the response variable given all the covariates. We investigate the performances of our proposed method through Monte Carlo simulation study and real application and the numerical results show that the resulting estimator by our algorithm enjoys good performance and demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method to analyze heteroscedasticity."

Neural correlates of temporal context retrieval for abstract scrambled phrases: Reducing narrative and familiarity-based strategies,"Fang Wang, Rachel A. Diana, ","Brain Research, Volume 1655, 15 January 2017, Pages 128-137, ","Temporal context, memory for the timing of events, can be assessed using non-temporal strategies such as relative familiarity or inference from a semantic narrative. Neuroimaging studies, which have previously encouraged such strategies, find similar patterns of brain regions involved in both temporal and non-temporal context memory. The present study aims to investigate whether previous findings are driven by the use of non-temporal strategies or whether the same pattern of brain regions is identified when relative familiarity and semantic narrative strategies are discouraged. We used abstract phrases (e.g. alone me leave) created by scrambling familiar three-word phrases. The words in the phrases were less concrete than the object image stimuli used in previous studies of temporal context memory (Jenkins and Ranganath, 2010) and were presented quickly while participants read each word aloud. This differed from previous studies in which participants were encouraged to use narrative strategies during encoding (Tubridy and Davachi, 2011) and was designed to discourage use of narrative strategies. The relative familiarity of the words within each phrase was similar and likely not diagnostic of word order during encoding, in order to minimize the use of relative familiarity strategies. Neuroimaging results indicate that temporal context retrieval was associated with the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex, which are regions consistent with the retrieval of non-temporal context in episodic memory, suggesting that previous findings were not driven entirely by non-temporal strategies but rather that temporal memory relies on similar brain regions to non-temporal memory."
Biological parametric mapping: A statistical toolbox for multimodality brain image analysis,"Ramon Casanova, Ryali Srikanth, Aaron Baer, Paul J. Laurienti, Joseph A. Maldjian, ","NeuroImage, Volume 34, Issue 1, 1 January 2007, Pages 137-143, ","In recent years, multiple brain MR imaging modalities have emerged; however, analysis methodologies have mainly remained modality-specific. In addition, when comparing across imaging modalities, most researchers have been forced to rely on simple region-of-interest type analyses, which do not allow the voxel-by-voxel comparisons necessary to answer more sophisticated neuroscience questions. To overcome these limitations, we developed a toolbox for multimodal image analysis called biological parametric mapping (BPM), based on a voxel-wise use of the general linear model. The BPM toolbox incorporates information obtained from other modalities as regressors in a voxel-wise analysis, thereby permitting investigation of more sophisticated hypotheses. The BPM toolbox has been developed in Matlab with a user-friendly interface for performing analyses, including voxel-wise multimodal correlation, ANCOVA, and multiple regression. It has a high degree of integration with the SPM (statistical parametric mapping) software relying on it for visualization and statistical inference. Furthermore, statistical inference for a correlation field, rather than a widely used T-field, has been implemented in the correlation analysis for more accurate results. An example with in vivo data is presented, demonstrating the potential of the BPM methodology as a tool for multimodal image analysis."

A collector analytical model was used to show that less than 13 of the chi-square for a second order polynomial could be attributed to different environmental conditions from facility to facility. In general, data from a single facility were consistent and the majority of scatter was attributed to systematic uncertainties from facility to facility. When the data from six participants reportedly adhering to the requirements of ASHRAE Standard 93-77 were analyzed, the scatter was found to be within normal limits expected for the test procedure."
"Rosiglitazone elevates sensitization of drug-resistant oral epidermoid carcinoma cells to vincristine by G2/M-phase arrest, independent of PPAR-污 pathway","Hong-Yuan Wang, Ying Zhang, Yue Zhou, Yu-Yin Lu, Xiu-Li Guo, ","Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, Volume 83, October 2016, Pages 349-361, ","Rosiglitazone (ROSI), an oral antidiabetic agent, has been reported the anti-cancer properties recent years. In this paper, the potency of ROSI as a synergistic drug for vincristine (VCR) on resistant oral cancer cells was investigated. We found that ROSI potently enhanced the susceptibility of KB cells or KB/V cells to VCR in a dose manner and the synergy in KB/V cells was much more prominent than that in KB cells. The synergistic anti-proliferative effect of ROSI and VCR was associated with inhibition on tubulin polymerization, cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and cell apoptosis induction, but has no effect on drug efflux-protein P-gp and was independent with PPAR污. The combination treatment of ROSI and VCR could regulate the PTEN/PI3K/AKT survival pathway with an upregulation of PTEN and down-regulation of p-AKT. The effect of G2/M phase arrest was associated with the upregulation of cyclin B1 and downregulation of p-cdc2. The apoptosis induction of ROSI and VCR was partly due to an upregulation of cleaved PARP and downregulation of Bcl-2/Bax ratio. In addition, combination treatment of ROSI and VCR had also shown anti-angiogenic effect by suppressing the migration and blocking the capillary tube formation of HUVECs. More importantly, this combination treatment induced an acceptably weak cytotoxicity in human normal HL-7702 cells, GES-1 cells and HUVECs. Taken together, ROSI may be used as a potential compound for combinatorial therapy or as a complement to VCR for treatment on oral cancer, especially on that have acquired resistance to VCR therapy."

The nonequilibrium model is discretized by an implicit finite difference method and solved numerically using an iterative tri-diagonal matrix algorithm. The evolutions of powder bed surface temperature and various interfacial locations as well as the melting temperature range during the melting process are investigated. The results show that liquid region, upper and lower parts of mushy zone are formed on the top of unsintered zone as the melting progresses. The duration of the preheating stage shortens and the melting rate accelerates as the initial porosity or initial temperature increases while particle size has much less effect on the melting process. The parametric study shows the melting temperature range of the powder bed widens with increasing initial porosity, decreasing initial temperature or increasing particle size."

The results show that the flow structure of different aspect ratios develops from conduction-dominated to steady convection-dominated, and finally evolves into periodic oscillatory convection as buoyancy ratio or Rayleigh number increases. The vortex number of flow structure, recirculation zones of isotherm and isoconcentration contours reduce along the transition route while both of them increase as aspect ratio decreases.

Lin, Ying Zhou, ","Vacuum, Volume 141, July 2017, Pages 316-327, ","The isothermal compressive experiments of a Nb containing Ni-Fe-Cr-base superalloy are carried out. The influences of initial 汛 phase (Ni3Nb) upon dynamic recrystallization (DRX) behavior are discussed. By analyzing the experimental data, the DRX kinetics models are constructed by considering the synthetical influences of initial 汛 phase, strain rate and deformation temperature. The proposed DRX kinetics model quantitatively reveals the influences of 汛 phase on the DRX behavior, which is further verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) observations. 汛 phase impedes the dislocation movement and supports preferential nucleation sites for DRX during hot deformation. Moreover, due to the pinning effect of 汛 phase, the DRX grain boundary migration can hardly proceed and the growth of DRX grain is restricted. However, with deformation temperature increasing, 汛 phase gradually dissolves and the influences upon DRX behavior become weaken."
Analysis of particle dynamics in a horizontal pneumatic conveying of the minimum pressure drop based on POD and wavelet transform,"Yan Zheng, Akira Rinoshika, ","Powder Technology, Volume 320, October 2017, Pages 726-738, ","In order to study the characters of particle fluctuation velocity at the minimum pressure drop (MPD) velocity in the acceleration and fully developed regimes of a horizontal pneumatic conveying, the particle fluctuation velocities measured by the high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) are first analyzed by time-averaged particle velocity, fluctuating energy, power spectrum and autocorrelation. Then the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and continuous wavelet transform are developed to reveal the particle fluctuation velocities in terms of the contributions to the particle fluctuation energy, time-frequency distribution, as well as probability density function from POD modes. The energy distributions of POD modes suggest that the first two POD modes are most energetic and dominate the particle motion, and the dominance increases from the acceleration regime to fully-developed regime. The time-frequency characteristics of POD modes reveal that small-scale particle fluctuations are suppressed in the fully-developed regime. It implies that the suppression of small-scale particle fluctuations may result in lower pressure drop at MPD velocity. The PDF distributions of POD modes exhibit that the particle fluctuation of first two POD modes follows the Gaussian distribution in the acceleration and fully developed regimes. However, the PDF distributions of POD modes gradually deviate from Gaussian distribution as increasing mode number.Download high-res image (477KB)Download full-size image"
Effects of Bulk Densities and Inlet Airflow Velocities on Forward Smoldering Propagation Properties of Flexible Polyurethane Foam,"Sheng Wang, Fei You, Shi-qiang Hu, Ya Zhou, Wei Sun, ","Procedia Engineering, Volume 211, 2018, Pages 762-767, ","Smoldering processes of flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF) with densities of 20.0, 30.0 and 35.0 kg/m3 were simulated in a self-designed mesoscale generator with dimensions of 60.0 cm ℅ 25.0 cm ℅ 25.0 cm. Characteristic parameters like smoldering establishment time, average smoldering rate, smoldering temperature, and high temperature duration were proposed and analyzed at five different air flow rates of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 7.0 L/min. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the morphological evolution of bulk materials before establishment and propagation of smoldering. Air was forced in the direction of approximately one-dimensional forward propagation. Results show that FPUF (20.0 kg/m3) has the shortest average smoldering establishment time of 1828.0 s at five airflow rates, FPUF (30.0 kg/m3) has the longest average smoldering establishment time of 2646.0 s. The average smoldering rate of FPUF (35.0 kg/m3) is higher than that of FPUF (30.0 kg/m). Smoldering of FPUF (20.0 kg/m3) cannot be self-sustained, due to largest porosity and insufficient heat accumulation. The average smoldering temperature and duration of high temperature values of FPUF (30.0 kg/m3) are higher than those of FPUF (35.0 kg/m3), and the highest average smoldering temperature of FPUF (30.0 kg/m3) is 410.0 ⊥. Since smoldering is derived from chemical reactions of oxygen transported and pyrolyzed products, the bulk material with low density shows higher porosity and contains more oxygen, it burns more fully and thus smoldering establishment time is less. In the process of smoldering, the oxidation and exothermic effects of porous carbon-based chars and oxygen is the main source of energy for the self-sustaining propagation of smoldering. The porosity of FPUF with high density (35.0 kg/m3) is lower, the burning produces a porous carbonate residue and limits the heat loss on the surface, so the smoldering rate of FPUF (35.0 kg/m3) is faster."

Conventionally, owing to the Volmer每Weber growth of ceria on Au(111), ceria nanostructures with controlled layer thickness and well-defined structure have been difficult to grow on Au(111). We explored the influence of growth parameters, such as the substrate temperature for ceria deposition, the flux of Ce atoms and the annealing temperature in this study. We found that ceria prefers to form bilayer nanostructures, i.e. two OCe每O layers, over a large range of growth conditions, whereas monolayer ceria nanostructures could also be obtained on Au(111) with the careful control of growth kinetics. Upon the growth of these well-defined ceria nanostructures, element-specific STM images could also be achieved on their surfaces, which allow the identification of surface and sub-surface O vacancies on ceria. The construction and atomic-scale characterization of these CeOx/Au(111) model catalysts would facilitate the subsequent studies on their surface chemistry and aid our understanding on the catalysis by ceria nanostructures.Download high-res image (231KB)Download full-size image"

Quasi-static tests of RC columns under variable axial forces and rotations,"Guoshan Xu, Bin Wu, Dedeng Jia, Xiaotong Xu, Ge Yang, ","Engineering Structures, Volume 162, 1 May 2018, Pages 60-71, ","The behaviour of reinforced-concrete (RC) elements subjected to axial force and rotation variations in conjunction with lateral displacement variation is considered a highly important topic, but only a few experimental studies investigating this topic have been performed. In this paper, five full-scale RC rectangular columns were tested by quasi-static testing (QST) to investigate the effects of large variation axial forces and rotations on the seismic behaviour of columns. Furthermore, the effects of variable axial forces and rotations on the seismic performance of RC columns in terms of the failure modes, hysteretic loops, skeleton curves, ductility factors, stiffness degradations and energy dissipations are presented and analysed. Based on the QST results, the axial force and rotation variations have significant effect on the seismic behaviour of RC columns. Generally, the variable axial forces and rotations may cause a distinct asymmetrical failure phenomenon in the specimens and reduce the lateral strength and ductility factor. Thus, RC columns should be well designed to account for the adverse effects of variable axial forces and rotations."

Stuart, ","Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Structure and Expression, Volume 1769, Issues 11每12, November每December 2007, Pages 631-640, ","Glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), while first found in human fetal muscle, is predominantly expressed in brain and neural tissue. By several independent techniques we have previously shown that GLUT3 is expressed in human skeletal muscle cells. The structure of the human GLUT3 gene has not been previously reported nor has there been any evaluation of the 5∩-untranslated region (UTR). To this end, we have cloned and sequenced the human GLUT3 gene. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) increased endogenous Glut3 protein in cultured L6 myotubes, and similarly stimulated luciferase activity in a construct of the human GLUT3 5∩-UTR linked to a luciferase reporter gene. Actinomycin D, an inhibitor of mRNA synthesis, prevented IGF-1 stimulation of Glut3 protein. Transfection of L6 cells with Sp1 increased Glut3 and augmented IGF-1 stimulation of Glut3 expression. Knockdown of Glut3 expression in cultured L6 muscle cells using small interference RNA (siRNA) specific for Glut3 significantly reduced myocyte glucose uptake. DNAse footprinting and gel shift assays showed Sp1 specifically bound to the human GLUT3 5∩-UTR. Substitution mutants of the human GLUT3 5∩-UTR luciferase construct indicated that only one of three Sp1 site clusters was involved in IGF-1 action. These data, using both a human GLUT3 5∩-UTR construct and L6 cells' endogenous promoter, suggest that IGF-1 plays a role in maintaining muscle GLUT3 expression and basal glucose uptake via the transcriptional factor Sp1."

Subscriber churn in the Australian ISP market,"Gary Madden, Scott J.

Australian ISPs range in size from a few large national operators to niche ISPs focused on specialised service. With many ISPs currently not profitable, subscriber retention is an important aspect of survival. This study develops a model which relates the probability of subscriber churn to various service attributes and subscriber characteristics. Estimation results show that churn probability is positively associated with monthly ISP expenditure, but inversely related to household income. Pricing also matters with subscribers preferring ISPs which offer flat-rate pricing arrangements."
Pfaffian orientations and perfect matchings of scale-free networks,"Zhongzhi Zhang, Bin Wu, ","Theoretical Computer Science, Volume 570, 9 March 2015, Pages 55-69, ","Counting perfect matchings is of great interest in theoretical computer science, mathematics, among other disciplines. However, explicitly determining the number of perfect matchings of general graphs is a challenge. In this paper, we present a first analytical study of the enumeration problem of perfect matchings on scale-free networks, which are ubiquitous in real-life systems. We focus on two iteratively growing scale-free networks: one is fractal, while the other is non-fractal. For each network, we construct an orientation and prove that it is Pfaffian. Then, based on the connection between the number of perfect matchings and determinant of the skew adjacency matrix corresponding to a Pfaffian orientation, we derive the recursive expressions for the number of perfect matchings of the networks at two successive iterations. Furthermore, using the recursive relations, we show that for both scale-free networks, their entropy is zero, which is in sharp contrast to the previously obtained results for other networks without scale-free behavior, but having the same average degree as the studied networks, such as square lattice and honeycomb lattice, whose entropies are larger than zero. Our results indicate from another angle that scale-free networks have a distinct architecture in comparison with those lattices lacking the power-law property."

Furthermore, the percentage change is often analyzed, but this is highly impacted by the baseline values and can be potentially misleading. Thus, the objective of this study was to illustrate the common misuse of the effect size and percent change measures.Here we provide a realistic sample data set comparing two resistance training groups with the same pre-test to post-test change.Statistical tests that are commonly performed within the literature were computed.Analyzing the within group effect size favors the control group, while the percent change favors the experimental group.

This details the magnitude and variability within the response to the intervention itself in units that are easily interpretable.This manuscript demonstrates the common misuse of the effect size and details the importance for investigators to always report raw values, even when alternative statistics are performed."

The literature lacks a comprehensive study of this tumor. Thirty-five cases of anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas diagnosed between 1955 and 1997 were retrieved from the Endocrine Registry at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Histology, immunophenotype, molecular analysis, and patient follow-up were analyzed. The tumors of 10 women and 25 men, aged 34 to 85 years (mean age at presentation, 62.5 years), were studied. Patients had vague symptoms (weight loss, pain, and fatigue, nausea, or vomiting), lasting an average of 13.2 weeks. The tumors, of an average size of 9.2 cm, were usually in the head or tail of the pancreas. The tumors were widely infiltrative, histomorphologically separated into predominantly large, pleomorphic cell, or spindle cell groups. Tumor phagocytosis and necrosis were noted. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed an epithelial origin with at least one epithelial marker in 78% of the tumors. K-ras mutations by sequence analysis were found in eight of 12 cases tested. Surgical biopsy/excision was used in all patients. Twenty-nine of 35 patients died of disease (average, 5.2 months), three died with no evidence of disease (average, 56.9 months), and three patients were alive at last follow-up (average, 94.0 months), one with residual disease. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between patients with and without a K-ras mutation. Anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas usually occurs in the head of the pancreas in older men. The epithelial nature of the pleomorphic cells (giant or spindled) can usually be documented. Patients with K-ras mutations have a shorter survival time, even though the overall prognosis for all anaplastic carcinomas is fatal (93% fatality; average survival, 448 days).

Negative Poisson＊s ratios in tendons: An unexpected mechanical response,"Ruben Gatt, Michelle Vella Wood, Alfred Gatt, Francis Zarb, Joseph N. Grima, ","Acta Biomaterialia, Volume 24, 15 September 2015, Pages 201-208, ","Tendons are visco-elastic structures that connect bones to muscles and perform the basic function of force transfer to and from the skeleton. They are essential for positioning as well as energy storing when involved in more abrupt movements such as jumping. Unfortunately, they are also prone to damage, and when injuries occur, they may have dilapidating consequences. For instance, there is consensus that injuries of tendons such as Achilles tendinopathies, which are common in athletes, are difficult to treat. Here we show, through in vivo and ex vivo tests, that healthy tendons are highly anisotropic and behave in a very unconventional manner when stretched, and exhibit a negative Poisson＊s ratio (auxeticity) in some planes when stretched up to 2% along their length, i.e. within their normal range of motion. Furthermore, since the Poisson＊s ratio is highly dependent on the material＊s microstructure, which may be lost if tendons are damaged or diseased, this property may provide a suitable diagnostic tool to assess tendon health.We report that human tendons including the Achilles tendons exhibits the very unusual mechanical property of a negative Poisson＊s ratio (auxetic) meaning that they get fatter rather than thinner when stretched. This report is backed by in vivo and ex vivo experiments we performed which clearly confirm auxeticity in this living material for strains which correspond to those experienced during most normal everyday activities. We also show that this property is not limited to the human Achilles tendon, as it was also found in tendons taken from sheep and pigs. This new information about tendons can form the scientific basis for a test for tendon health as well as enable the design of better tendon prosthesis which could replace damaged tendons.Download high-res image (114KB)Download full-size image"

Common and distinct brain activation to viewing dynamic sequences of face and hand movements,"James C. Thompson, Jillian E.

It is unclear whether the STS responds to the movement of different body parts uniformly, or if the response depends on the body part that is moving. Here we examined brain activity to recognizing sequences of face and hand movements as well as radial grating motion, controlling for differences in movement dynamics between stimuli. A region of the right posterior STS (pSTS) showed common activation to both face and hand motion, relative to radial grating motion, with no significant difference between responses to face and hand motion in this region. Distinct responses to face motion relative to hand motion were observed in the right mid-STS, while the right posterior inferior temporal sulcus (pITS) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) showed greater responses to hand motion relative to face motion. These findings indicate that while there may be distinct processing of different body part motion in lateral temporal and inferior parietal cortices, the response of the pSTS is not body part specific. This region may provide input to other parts of a network involved with processing human actions with a high-level visual description of biological motion."

Ethanol self-administration modulation of NMDA receptor subunit and related synaptic protein mRNA expression in prefrontal cortical fields in cynomolgus monkeys,"Glen Acosta, Wendy Hasenkamp, James B. Daunais, David P. Friedman, Scott E. Hemby, ","Brain Research, Volume 1318, 8 March 2010, Pages 144-154, ","Background: Functional impairment of the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex underlies deficits in executive control that characterize addictive disorders, including alcohol addiction. Previous studies indicate that alcohol alters glutamate neurotransmission and one substrate of these effects may be through the reconfiguration of the subunits constituting ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) complexes. Glutamatergic transmission is integral to cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical communication, and alcohol-induced changes in the abundance of the receptor subunits and/or their splice variants may result in critical functional impairments of prefrontal cortex in the alcohol-addicted state. Methods and results: The effects of chronic ethanol self-administration on glutamate receptor ionotropic NMDA (GRIN), as well as GRIN1 splice variant mRNA expression was studied in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; Area 13), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; Area 46) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; Area 24) of male cynomolgus monkeys. Chronic ethanol self-administration resulted in significant changes in the expression of NMDA subunit mRNA expression in the DLPFC and OFC, but not the ACC. In DLPFC, the overall expression of NMDA subunits was significantly decreased in ethanol treated monkeys. Slight but significant changes were observed for synaptic associated protein 102 kD (SAP102) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNAs. In OFC, the NMDAR1 variant GRIN1-1 was reduced while GRIN1-2 was increased. Furthermore, no significant changes in GFAP protein levels were observed in either the DLPFC or OFC. Conclusion: Results from these studies provide the first demonstration of posttranscriptional regulation of iGluR subunits in the primate brain following long-term ethanol self-administration. Furthermore, changes in these transcripts do not appear to reflect changes in glial activation or loss. Further studies examining the expression and cellular localization of subunit proteins and receptor pharmacology would shed more light on the findings reported here."
"Insights into IL-37, the role in autoimmune diseases","Wang-Dong Xu, Yi Zhao, Yi Liu, ","Autoimmunity Reviews, Volume 14, Issue 12, December 2015, Pages 1170-1175, ","Autoimmune diseases are characterized by the impaired function and the destruction of tissues that are caused by an immune response in which aberrant antibodies are generated and attack the body's own cells and tissues. Interleukin (IL) -37, a new member of the IL-1 family, broadly reduces innate inflammation as well as acquired immune responses. Recently, studies have shown that expression of IL-37 was abnormal in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriasis, Graves' disease (GD). In addition, functional analysis indicated that IL-37 is negatively involved in the development and pathogenesis of these autoimmune disorders. The strong association of this cytokine with autoimmune diseases promotes us to systematically review what had been published recently on the crucial nature of IL-37 in relation to autoimmune diseases gaining attention for its regulatory capability in these autoimmune disorders."
"Chapter Five: Algorithms, Applications, and Challenges of Protein Structure Alignment","Jianzhu Ma, Sheng Wang, ","Advances in Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology, Volume 94, 2014, Pages 121-175, ","As a fundamental problem in computational structure biology, protein structure alignment has attracted the focus of the community for more than 20 years. While the pairwise structure alignment could be applied to measure the similarity between two proteins, which is a first step for homology search and fold space construction, the multiple structure alignment could be used to understand evolutionary conservation and divergence from a family of protein structures. Structure alignment is an NP-hard problem, which is only computationally tractable by using heuristics. Three levels of heuristics for pairwise structure alignment have been proposed, from the representations of protein structure, the perspectives of viewing protein as a rigid-body or flexible, to the scoring functions as well as the search algorithms for the alignment. For multiple structure alignment, the fourth level of heuristics is applied on how to merge all input structures to a multiple structure alignment. In this review, we first present a small survey of current methods for protein pairwise and multiple alignment, focusing on those that are publicly available as web servers. In more detail, we also discuss the advancements on the development of the new approaches to increase the pairwise alignment accuracy, to efficiently and reliably merge input structures to the multiple structure alignment. Finally, besides broadening the spectrum of the applications of structure alignment for protein template-based prediction, we also list several open problems that need to be solved in the future, such as the large complex alignment and the fast database search."

Thompson, ","Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, Volume 76, Issue 3, November 2001, Pages 314-341, ","The authors evaluate a mapping of Rescorla and Wagner's (1972) behavioral model of classical conditioning onto the cerebellar substrates for motor reflex learning and illustrate how the limitations of the Rescorla-Wagner model are just as useful as its successes for guiding the development of new psychobiological theories of learning. They postulate that the inhibitory pathway that returns conditioned response information from the cerebellar interpositus nucleus back to the inferior olive is the neural basis for the error correction learning proposed by Rescorla and Wagner (Gluck, Myers, & Thompson, 1994; Thompson, 1986). The authors' cerebellar model expects that behavioral processes described by the Rescorla-Wagner model will be localized within the cerebellum and related brain stem structures, whereas behavioral processes beyond the scope of the Rescorla-Wagner model will depend on extracerebellar structures such as the hippocampus and related cortical regions. Simulations presented here support both implications. Several novel implications of the authors' cerebellar error-correcting model are described including a recent empirical study by Kim, Krupa, and Thompson (1998), who verified that suppressing the putative error correction pathway should interfere with the Kamin (1969) blocking effect, a behavioral manifestation of error correction learning. The authors also discuss the model's implications for understanding the limits of cerebellar contributions to associative learning and how this informs our understanding of hippocampal function in conditioning. This leads to a more integrative view of the neural substrates of conditioning in which the authors' real-time circuit-level model of the cerebellum can be viewed as a generalization of the long-term memory module of Gluck and Myers' (1993) trial-level theory of cerebellar-hippocampal interaction in motor conditioning."
v-p material point method for weakly compressible problems,"Zhen-Peng Chen, Xiong Zhang, Kam Yim Sze, Lei Kan, Xin-Ming Qiu, ","Computers & Fluids, In press, corrected proof, Available online 5 September 2018, ","The weakly compressible material point method (WCMPM) suffers from volumetric-locking and numerical oscillation in modeling fluid flow and fluid-structure interaction problems. In this paper, a v-p
formulation of the material point method (vp-MPM) is proposed for weakly compressible problems based on a two-field variational principle. As only the velocity v and the pressure p are the independent variables, the v-p formulation has much less extra variables than those based on the Hu-Washizu multi-field variational principle which takes the velocity, strain and stress as independent variables. The pressure is assumed independently in the control volume of each gird node. Spurious pressure oscillation reduces but still occurs at the interface of discontinuity due to large pressure gradient difference across the interface. Therefore, a slope limiter is employed to suppress the oscillation and the general interpolation functions are used to eliminate the cell-crossing error. In order to extend the method to the fluid-structure interaction problems, the v-p formulation is incorporated into the improved coupled finite element material point method. Several numerical examples are presented to validate the vp-MPM."
Explaining the low utilization of government websites: Using a grounded theory approach,"Fang Wang, ","Government Information Quarterly, Volume 31, Issue 4, October 2014, Pages 610-621, ","The low utilization of government websites is a worldwide problem, and many governments have been criticized for this reason. Several existing fields are relevant to this complex phenomenon, but few succeed in providing a holistic explanation because of their segmentary perspectives and limitations in conceptual innovation due to deductive paradigms. In order to explore the mechanism of government website utilization from a more integrated perspective, a grounded theory approach is adopted in this study. 51 respondents were interviewed and a grounded theoretical model for government website utilization was generated. The contributions of this study include: (1) developing a holistic understanding on the mechanism of government website utilization, (2) identifying a few new theoretical concepts that were not explored in previous studies, (3) revealing that value acquisition is the essence of government website utilization, and (4) formulating a derivative conceptual model for delineating the process of information source selection."
Developing fragility curves for a pile-supported wharf,"Jiunn-Shyang Chiou, Chi-Han Chiang, Ho-Hsiung Yang, Shang-Yi Hsu, ","Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, Volume 31, Issues 5每6, May每June 2011, Pages 830-840, ","This study proposes a procedure for developing seismic fragility curves for a pile-supported wharf. A typical pile-supported wharf, as commonly used in the ports of Taiwan, is chosen for demonstration. For a structural model of the wharf, the deck is modeled by shell elements and the Winkler model is used for the pile每soil system, in which the piles and soils are represented by beam elements and springs, respectively. A pushover analysis with lateral loads distributed according to the fundamental modal shape of the wharf structure is conducted to deduce the capacity curve of the wharf. The procedure for developing fragility curves can be explicitly performed using the spreadsheet platform in Microsoft EXCEL. First, quantitative criteria for damage states are established from the sequence of development of plastic zones. Then a nonlinear static procedure called the Spectrum Capacity Method (CSM) is used to efficiently construct a response matrix of the wharf to 24 earthquake events with differing levels of peak ground acceleration (PGA). Based on the damage criteria and the response matrix, the fragility curves of the wharf can be thus constructed through simple statistical analysis. Shifted lognormal cumulative distribution functions are also employed to better approximate the fragility curves for practical applications."
Exploring the role of the posterior middle temporal gyrus in semantic cognition: Integration of anterior temporal lobe with executive processes,"James Davey, Hannah E. Thompson, Glyn Hallam, Theodoros Karapanagiotidis, Elizabeth Jefferies, ","NeuroImage, Volume 137, 15 August 2016, Pages 165-177, ","Making sense of the world around us depends upon selectively retrieving information relevant to our current goal or context. However, it is unclear whether selective semantic retrieval relies exclusively on general control mechanisms recruited in demanding non-semantic tasks, or instead on systems specialised for the control of meaning. One hypothesis is that the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) is important in the controlled retrieval of semantic (not non-semantic) information; however this view remains controversial since a parallel literature links this site to event and relational semantics. In a functional neuroimaging study, we demonstrated that an area of pMTG implicated in semantic control by a recent meta-analysis was activated in a conjunction of (i) semantic association over size judgements and (ii) action over colour feature matching. Under these circumstances the same region showed functional coupling with the inferior frontal gyrus 〞 another crucial site for semantic control. Structural and functional connectivity analyses demonstrated that this site is at the nexus of networks recruited in automatic semantic processing (the default mode network) and executively demanding tasks (the multiple-demand network). Moreover, in both task and task-free contexts, pMTG exhibited functional properties that were more similar to ventral parts of inferior frontal cortex, implicated in controlled semantic retrieval, than more dorsal inferior frontal sulcus, implicated in domain-general control. Finally, the pMTG region was functionally correlated at rest with other regions implicated in control-demanding semantic tasks, including inferior frontal gyrus and intraparietal sulcus. We suggest that pMTG may play a crucial role within a large-scale network that allows the integration of automatic retrieval in the default mode network with executively-demanding goal-oriented cognition, and that this could support our ability to understand actions and non-dominant semantic associations, allowing semantic retrieval to be ＆shaped＊ to suit a task or context.Download high-res image (96KB)Download full-size image"
Polysaccharide extracted from Enteromorpha ameliorates Cisplastin-induced small intestine injury in mice,"Xinxiu Ren, Lei Liu, Pingkun Liu, Yaser Gamallat, Dong Shang, ","Journal of Functional Foods, Volume 49, October 2018, Pages 154-161, ","Cisplatin is a commonly used drug against solid tumors. However, it can cause cell death in rapidly dividing intestinal epithelial cells. Enteromorpha (EP), an edible marine alga found in eastern China, and its polysaccharide fraction (PEP), can relieve constipation and modulate the intestinal microbiota. The aim of our study was to investigate the possible role of PEP in preventing cisplatin induced intestinal damage and gut microbiota imbalance in a mouse model. Cisplatin disturbed the intestinal microbiota and damaged the intestinal barriers. PEP treatment prior to cisplatin injection ameliorated these injuries and restored the gut microbial composition. We also analyzed the diversity of the fecal bacterial population by 16S DNA sequencing, and found a high abundance of the Escherichia 每 Shigella genera in the cisplatin treated mice. In conclusion, our results indicate that PEP is a powerful natural product that can protect against the gastrointestinal side effects of cisplatin."

The NHAMCS is a survey of hospital emergency department and outpatient visits. Emergency department visits by patients with SCD were identified using ICD-9-CM codes, and nationally weighted estimates were calculated.On average, approximately 197,333 emergency department visits were estimated to have occurred each year between 1999 and 2007 with SCD as one of the diagnoses listed. The expected source of payment was private insurance for 14%, Medicaid/State Children's Health Insurance Program for 58%, Medicare for 14%, and other/unknown for 15%. Approximately 29% of visits resulted in hospital admission; this was 37% among patients aged 0每19 years, and 26% among patients aged ≡20 years. The episode of care was indicated as a follow-up visit for 23% of the visits. Patient-cited reasons for the emergency department visit included chest pain (11%); other pain or unspecified pain (67%); fever/infection (6%); and shortness of breath/breathing problem/cough (5%), among other reasons.Substantial numbers of emergency department visits occur among people with SCD.

How RIG-I like receptors activate MAVS,"Bin Wu, Sun Hur, ","Current Opinion in Virology, Volume 12, June 2015, Pages 91-98, ","RIG-I and MDA5 are well-conserved cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors that detect viral RNAs during infection and activate the type I interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immune response. While much is known about how these receptors recognize viral RNAs, how they interact with their common signaling adaptor molecule MAVS and activate the downstream signaling pathway had been less clear. Previous studies have shown that the signaling domains (tandem CARDs or 2CARDs) of RIG-I and MDA5 must form homo-oligomers in order to interact with MAVS, and that their interactions lead to filament formation of MAVS, a pre-requisite for downstream signal activation. More recent data suggest that multiple mechanisms synergistically promote tetramer formation of RIG-I 2CARD, and that this tetramer resembles a lock-washer, which serves as a helical template to nucleate the MAVS filament. We here summarize these recent findings and discuss the current understanding of the signal activation mechanisms of RIG-I and MDA5."
A new radial integration polygonal boundary element method for solving heat conduction problems,"Miao Cui, Hai-Feng Peng, Bing-Bing Xu, Xiao-Wei Gao, Yuwen Zhang, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 123, August 2018, Pages 251-260, ","A new approach, radial integration polygonal boundary element method (RIPBEM), for solving heat conduction problems is presented in this paper. The proposed RIPBEM is a new concept in boundary element method (BEM), which would be of great flexibility in mesh generation of complex 3D geometries. Due to the characteristic of arbitrary shapes of polygonal elements, conventional shape functions are insufficient. Moreover, the resulted surface boundary integrals cannot be directly evaluated by the standard Gauss quadrature. To solve these problems, general shape functions for polygonal elements with arbitrary number of nodes are given. To generally and numerically calculate the resulted surface integrals, the radial integration method (RIM) is employed to convert the surface boundary integrals into equivalent contour line integrals of the polygonal elements. As for 3D domain integrals, they are transformed to equivalent line integrals using RIM twice. This methodology can explicitly eliminate strong singularities. Several numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed polygonal boundary element method for solving heat conduction problems."

In vitro studies were performed using a homemade extracorporeal circulation system. In vivo studies were performed using the rabbit abdominal aorta model.In vitro studies confirmed that VEGF121-transfected cells adhered on the surface of stainless steel stents with over 90% of the surface covered within 24 hours of seeding. In vivo results showed that VEGF121-transfected HUVECs-coated stents were covered with seeding cells after implanting, and almost completely covered with cells after stent implantation for 1 week. In contrast, the non-endothelialized areas of bare metal stents and glutin/poly-L-lysine-coated stents were covered at 4 weeks, and the monolayers of cells were not observed, but fragile neointima was found on the surface. After 12 weeks, VEGF121-transfected HUVECs-coated stents significantly reduced the neointima area (0.78 ㊣ 0.03 mm2) and stenosis (15.69 ㊣ 2.61%) as compared with those for bare metal stents (neointima area = 2.26 ㊣ 0.67 mm2; the percentage of stenosis = 47.55 ㊣ 7.10%;P < .01) and glutin/poly-L-lysine-coated stents (neointima area = 1.40 ㊣ 0.37 mm2; the percentage of stenosis = 31.37 ㊣ 8.18%;P < .01).In this small animal study, VEGF transfected human endothelial cells, when coated on stainless steel stents, reduce neointimal hyperplasia, promote endothelialization, and reduce in-stent restenosis. Additional studies with this technology are necessary to determine its ultimate utility in improving stents performance.This research was based on the clinical complications after stent implantation, especially in-stent restenosis and late endothelialization. However, here we only carried out the animal experiments."

Discriminative low-rank graph preserving dictionary learning with Schatten-p quasi-norm regularization for image recognition,"Haishun Du, Zhaolong Zhao, Sheng Wang, Fan Zhang, ","Neurocomputing, Volume 275, 31 January 2018, Pages 697-710, ","The dictionary used in sparse coding plays a key role in sparse representation-based classification. A desired dictionary should have powerful representational and discriminative capability. In this paper, we propose a discriminative low-rank graph preserving dictionary learning (DLRGP_DL) method to learn a discriminative structured dictionary for sparse representation-based image recognition, in which training samples might be corrupted with relatively large noise. Specifically, we impose the Schatten-p quasi-norm regularization on sub-dictionaries to make them to be of low-rank, which can effectively reduce the negative effect of noise contained in training samples and make the learned dictionary pure and compact. To improve the discriminative capability of the learned dictionary, we apply a discriminative graph preserving criterion to coding coefficients during the dictionary learning process with the goal that the similar training samples from the same class have similar coding coefficients. The learned dictionary is first used for sparse coding, and then both the learned coding coefficients of training samples and the class-specific reconstruction errors are used for classification. The experimental results on four image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DLRGP_DL."

Numerical modeling of parallel seismic method for detecting existing piles in layered soil,"Jing-Yi Zhang, Xiaoqin Lei, ","Soils and Foundations, Volume 58, Issue 1, February 2018, Pages 134-145, ","For piles connected to superstructures, whose pile tops are inaccessible, a lateral horizontal impact on the side of the piles through the generation of a flexural wave of the pile shaft is a more feasible approach. This paper presents a parallel seismic (PS) method based on the flexural wave of the pile shaft that combines down-hole tests for the length and an integrity evaluation of existing piles in layered soil. It is suggested that two PS tests be conducted by horizontal striking on the side surface of the pile along and perpendicular to the pile-to-borehole direction, respectively. The first arrivals of the transmitted P-wave and S-wave at the pile-soil interface obtained in these two PS tests and the results of down-hole tests are combined to analyze the pile length and to distinguish the embedded defects for the pile integrity evaluation. A simplified theoretical model for PS tests in layered soil is established, and a correction formula is proposed to correct the initial estimated pile length accordingly. A three-dimensional finite element model is then established to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed PS method in layered soil and the correction formula."
Comprehensive Cancer-Predisposition Gene Testing in an Adult Multiple Primary Tumor Series Shows a Broad Range of Deleterious Variants and Atypical Tumor Phenotypes,"James Whitworth, Philip S.

Currently, germline genetic testing of MPT-affected individuals for variants in cancer-predisposition genes (CPGs) is mostly targeted by tumor type. We ascertained pre-assessed MPT individuals (with at least two primary tumors by age 60 years or at least three by 70 years) from genetics centers and performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on 460 individuals from 440 families. Despite previous negative genetic assessment and molecular investigations, pathogenic variants in moderate- and high-risk CPGs were detected in 67/440 (15.2%) probands. WGS detected variants that would not be (or were not) detected by targeted resequencing strategies, including low-frequency structural variants (6/440 [1.4%] probands). In most individuals with a germline variant assessed as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP), at least one of their tumor types was characteristic of variants in the relevant CPG. However, in 29 probands (42.2% of those with a P/LP variant), the tumor phenotype appeared discordant. The frequency of individuals with truncating or splice-site CPG variants and at least one discordant tumor type was significantly higher than in a control population (聿2 = 43.642; p ≒ 0.0001). 2/67 (3%) probands with P/LP variants had evidence of multiple inherited neoplasia allele syndrome (MINAS) with deleterious variants in two CPGs. Together with variant detection rates from a previous series of similarly ascertained MPT-affected individuals, the present results suggest that first-line comprehensive CPG analysis in an MPT cohort referred to clinical genetics services would detect a deleterious variant in about a third of individuals."

The fouling-release (FR) performance of the coatings was evaluated in the laboratory using a suite of representative marine organisms. The coatings showed excellent FR performance toward the bacterium Halomonas pacifica and the diatom (microalga) Navicula incerta while the bacterium Cellulophaga lytica and sporelings of the green macroalga Ulva linza showed a relatively higher affinity for amphiphilic coating surfaces when compared to a series of standard control coatings."
Experimental estimate of CO2 concentration distribution in the stagnant gas layer inside the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) crucible,"Ping Geng, Yan Zhang, Yan Zheng, ","Fuel, Volume 224, 15 July 2018, Pages 250-254, ","The measurement of char gasification reactivity and kinetic parameters by TGA is generally complicated with mass transfer limitations. There is a reactant gas concentration gradient in the stagnant gas region between the mouth of the TGA crucible and the surface of the char bed because of gas consumption by the sample. The counter-diffusions between the reactant and product gases occur in this stagnant region. The Maxwell-Stefan equation has been used to estimate the distribution of gas concentration in the stagnant gas region. However, there is some uncertainty associated with semi-empirical gas diffusion coefficients used in the equation. In this study, we propose a new method to estimate the distribution of CO2 concentration in the stagnant gas region during CO2 gasification of coal char in TGA. The external effectiveness factors obtained in this way were in a reasonably good agreement with the value obtained by the traditional method widely used in literature."

Determinants of BH3 Binding Specificity for Mcl-1 versus Bcl-xL,"Sanjib Dutta, Stefano Gull芍, T. Scott Chen, Emiko Fire, Amy E. Keating, ","Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 398, Issue 5, 21 May 2010, Pages 747-762, ","Interactions among Bcl-2 family proteins are important for regulating apoptosis. Prosurvival members of the family interact with proapoptotic BH3 (Bcl-2-homology-3)-only members, inhibiting execution of cell death through the mitochondrial pathway. Structurally, this interaction is mediated by binding of the 汐-helical BH3 region of the proapoptotic proteins to a conserved hydrophobic groove on the prosurvival proteins. Native BH3-only proteins exhibit selectivity in binding prosurvival members, as do small molecules that block these interactions. Understanding the sequence and structural basis of interaction specificity in this family is important, as it may allow the prediction of new Bcl-2 family associations and/or the design of new classes of selective inhibitors to serve as reagents or therapeutics. In this work, we used two complementary techniques〞yeast surface display screening from combinatorial peptide libraries and SPOT peptide array analysis〞to elucidate specificity determinants for binding to Bcl-xLversus Mcl-1, two prominent prosurvival proteins. We screened a randomized library and identified BH3 peptides that bound to either Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL selectively or to both with high affinity. The peptides competed with native ligands for binding into the conserved hydrophobic groove, as illustrated in detail by a crystal structure of a specific peptide bound to Mcl-1. Mcl-1-selective peptides from the screen were highly specific for binding Mcl-1 in preference to Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Bfl-1, whereas Bcl-xL-selective peptides showed some cross-interaction with related proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-w. Mutational analyses using SPOT arrays revealed the effects of 170 point mutations made in the background of a peptide derived from the BH3 region of Bim, and a simple predictive model constructed using these data explained much of the specificity observed in our Mcl-1 versus Bcl-xL binders."

An Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potential is used in describing the interatomic interaction between metal atoms. The results showed that the cone-like nanostructures drastically enhance heat transfer from solid to liquid and they have significant effects on temperature and pressure histories, net evaporation number, as well as the density distribution in the system. In all cases studied, the liquid molecules above the solid surface go into explosive boiling and a cluster of liquid is observed to move upward. It was also observed that the separation temperature associated with separation of liquid film from solid surface strongly depends on size of nanostructure while it is not sensitive to the type of materials. Furthermore, in all cases in a specific time after beginning of boiling, the evaporation on the hot wall stopped and a non-evaporating layer will form on the surface."
P-glycoprotein targeted and near-infrared light-guided depletion of chemoresistant tumors,"Chengqiong Mao, Yan Zhao, Fang Li, Zibo Li, Xin Ming, ","Journal of Controlled Release, Volume 286, 28 September 2018, Pages 289-300, ","Drug resistance remains a formidable challenge to cancer therapy. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) contributes to multidrug resistance in numerous cancers by preventing accumulation of anticancer drugs in cancer cells. Strategies to overcome this resistance have been vigorously sought for over 3 decades, yet clinical solutions do not exist. The main reason for the failure is lack of cancer specificity of small-molecule Pgp inhibitors, thus causing severe toxicity in normal tissues. In this study, Pgp-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) was developed to achieve superior cancer specificity through antibody targeting plus locoregional light activation. Thus, a Pgp monoclonal antibody was chemically modified with IR700, a porphyrin photosensitizer. In vitro studies showed that the antibody-photosensitizer conjugates specifically bind to Pgp-expressing drug resistant cancer cells, and caused dramatic cytotoxicity upon irradiation with a near infrared light. We then tested our Pgp-targeted approach in mouse xenograft models of chemoresistant ovarian cancer and head and neck cancer. In both models, targeted PDT produced rapid tumor shrinkage, and significantly prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice. We conclude that our targeted PDT approach produces molecularly targeted and spatially selective ablation of chemoresistant tumors, and thereby provides an effective approach to overcome Pgp-mediated multidrug resistance in cancer, where conventional approaches have failed.Download high-res image (254KB)Download full-size image"

The chemical structures of these compounds are identified by NMR, MS and IR. The absorption and emission of these dyes were investigated by UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively. The results shown three dyes exhibited evident aggregation-induced emission (AIE) or aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) properties with wavelength tunable emission. Their emission color can be tuned from green to orange in tetrahydrofuran/H2O solutions, from green to red in solid state or pure tetrahydrofuran solutions. In addition, the solution or film of TPA-TPE shown results in distinct fluorescence from ※ON§ to ※Off§ observation as well as color change from orange yellow to colorless by naked eyes when the addition of toxic Cl2 gas, which can be used as an excellent dual chromo- and fluorogenic signal changes that is well suited for monitoring Cl2 gas in solution, or solid film, conveniently. These results indicate TPA-TPE is a promising candidate chemosensor for the detection of Cl2 gas.Download high-res image (171KB)Download full-size image"

Data-driven rolling-horizon robust optimization for petrochemical scheduling using probability density contours,"Yi Zhang, Yiping Feng, Gang Rong, ","Computers & Chemical Engineering, Volume 115, 12 July 2018, Pages 342-360, ","In the process industry, uncertain factors, such as yield, can be quantified by analyzing industrial data generated from continuous sources. Traditional data-driven robust optimization models are mostly built on estimated probability distributions and convex uncertainty sets. As a result, the scheduling solution is only applicable to the limited sample of stochastic scenarios. We developed a rolling-horizon optimization approach to adapt the robust model to the changing environmental and operational conditions. First, a novel uncertainty set is defined by the probability density contours, covering scenarios with high possibility of occurrence. Then, we propose using new robust formulations induced by the outer-approximations of nonconvex uncertainty set. By implementing the raised model on a real-world ethylene production process using the available data, the fluctuation in fuel gas consumption can be controlled within 2%. Additionally, in agreement with our proof, the system＊s total profit and consumption of fuel gas stabilize in finite steps."
The pathophysiology and treatment of canine kerosene pulmonary injury: Effects of plasmapheresis and positive end-expiratory pressure,"Aaron R. Zucker, J. Lasha Sznajder, Carolyn J. Becker, Stuart Berger, L. D. H. Wood, ","Journal of Critical Care, Volume 4, Issue 3, September 1989, Pages 184-193, ","Hydrocarbon aspiration is a relatively common cause of pulmonary injury in the pediatric age group. We evaluated the pathophysiology of kerosene aspiration in 18 anesthetized dogs during the first hour after injury and then compared the effects of treatments by plasmapheresis (n = 6) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cm H2O (n = 6) with the results obtained in untreated control dogs (n = 6) over the next four hours. A group of uninjured control dogs (n = 3) confirmed that surgical preparation and saline sham injury did not cause acute lung injury like that due to kerosene. The untreated control dogs with a stable pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (Ppw) of 10 torr received 0.5 mL/kg of intratracheal kerosene. Although Ppw was maintained at 10 torr for five hours post-injury in these dogs, there was a wide range of lung edema (wet lung weight to body weight ratios from 16.4 to 61.1 g/kg; median of 41.4 g/kg). Between one and five hours, extravascular thermal volume (ETV) increased by 19.1 mL/kg, associated with a median increase in venous admixture (Ova/ Qt) of 28.5% and a median reduction in lung compliance of 12.7 mL/cm H2O. Another group of dogs was similarly injured, but underwent batch plasmapheresis one hour after injury to reduce Ppw to a target value of 5 torr for the remainder of the protocol. Plasmapheresis was associated with a smaller change in ETV (0.8 mL/kg, P < .05 compared with injured animals, Kruskall-Wallis). Gravimetric analysis of edema from lungs excised at five hours confirmed the in vivo findings that reduced Ppw was associated with a lower median wet weight to body weight ratio (20.5 g/kg) than in the untreated group (P < .06, Kruskall-Wallis). Similarly, progressive increases in Qva/Qt (2.6%, P < .06) and decreases in lung compliance (3.7 mL/cm H2O, P < .05) were prevented by plasmapheresis. A third group of dogs with transmural Ppw maintained at 10 torr underwent identical injury but were treated from one hour with 10 cm H2O PEEP. In this group, Qva/Qt was also stabilized (median decrease of 2.5%): but edema formation continued (median ETV increase of 28.5 mL/kg). Cardiac output and oxygen delivery were adequately maintained in both treatment groups so that oxygen consumption was not reduced. We conclude that kerosene aspiration caused pulmonary vascular leaks of varied severity and that plasmapheresis reduced pulmonary edema and its adverse effects on gas exchange and lung mechanics in this model. PEEP also reduced Qva/Qt, but did not reduce edema or lung stiffness and so necessitated the use of higher inflation pressures. Because plasmapheresis did not adversely affect systemic oxygen delivery and consumption, this canine study supports a therapeutic approach to early hydrocarbon pneumonitis of seeking the lowest vascular volume or Ppw associated with an adequate cardiac output and oxygen transport."

The present study focused on assessing the cybersecurity judgment of 462 college students as a specific group of ordinary users in order to further identify specific weakest links of the weakest link. It was found that (1) the average percentage correct for cybersecurity judgement among the 462 students was 65%, (2) 104 (23%) students showed the lowest correct judgements (below 50%), (3) two of 16 cybersecurity items received the lowest correct judgement (below 50%), and (4) students' correct rational judgment (64%) was not significantly higher than their correct intuitive judgement (66%). These results not only empirically quantify the weakest link in cybersecurity judgement in general but also further specify the weakest links within the weakest link in particular, and thus have generated the earliest benchmarking data of the weakest link phenomenon and can help design effective cybersecurity prevention and intervention programs for ordinary users."

Studies were included if they met the following criteria: 1) targeted medical students; 2) assessed sun avoidance, sun protection, skin self-examination, and/or indoor tanning behaviors; 3) were published in peer-reviewed journals; and 4) complete data were available for extraction.A total of 21 studies are included in this review. Important findings include moderate-to-high levels of skin cancer knowledge and low levels of both sunscreen and ultraviolet light knowledge. The attitudes and knowledge of medical students reflect a low level of concern with regard to the perceived importance of skin cancer compared with other forms of cancer despite a high level of concern for the importance of skin cancer prevention. Furthermore, this review demonstrated that medical students fail to protect themselves routinely from the sun and have a high interest in tanning bed use.This review demonstrates the need to educate medical students about skin cancer and skin cancer preventive behaviors. New strategies and educational campaigns should be developed to communicate better information on skin cancer morbidity, mortality, and prevention to medical students. This will pay dividends by improving the practice of these future physicians in all specialties."

Discrimination of tea varieties using FTIR spectroscopy and allied Gustafson-Kessel clustering,"Xiaohong Wu, Jin Zhu, Bin Wu, Jun Sun, Chunxia Dai, ","Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, Volume 147, April 2018, Pages 64-69, ","For the purpose of classifying tea varieties, allied Gustafson-Kessel (AGK) clustering was proposed to cluster the Fourier transform infrared reflectance (FTIR) spectra of tea samples. As a fuzzy clustering algorithm, AGK can not only produce fuzzy membership and typicality values but also cluster various shapes of data with the help of Gustafson-Kessel (GK) clustering. After FTIR spectra were collected by FTIR-7600 infrared spectrometer, they were preprocessed with multiple scatter correction (MSC). To reduce the dimensionality of FTIR spectra and make the classification of data easily, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to process the FTIR spectra. After that, fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering, possibilistic c-means (PCM) clustering, AGK clustering and allied fuzzy c-means (AFCM) clustering were performed to cluster data, respectively. The clustering accuracy of AGK achieved 93.9% which was the highest one than other fuzzy clustering algorithms. The results obtained in experiments showed that AGK coupled with FTIR spectroscopy could provide an effective discrimination model for classification of tea varieties successfully."
Synthesis and characterization of sulfur-doped carbon decorated LiFePO4 nanocomposite as high performance cathode material for lithium-ion batteries,"Dong Xu, Peifeng Wang, Biwen Shen, ","Ceramics International, Volume 42, Issue 4, March 2016, Pages 5331-5338, ","This is the first report where crystalline sulfur-doped carbon decorated LiFePO4 nanocomposite are employed as cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. The electrode has been synthesized via a sol每gel route, in which benzyl disulfide and oxalic acid are used as the sulfur and carbon source, respectively. Meanwhile, the as-synthesized sample is characterized by XRD, SEM, EDS mapping, TEM, Raman spectra, XPS and electrochemical techniques. The results reveal that the sulfur-doped carbon is uniformly coated on the surface of LiFePO4 without destroying the crystal structure of the bulk material. Moreover, both the electronic conductivity and defect level of the carbon clearly increase, as a consequence, the electron and Li-ion diffusion of the electrode is further improved. As a cathode material for lithium-ion batteries, it exhibits a more outstanding electrochemical performance, especially the rate capability and long cyclic performance. Thus, it can be drawn a conclusion that the sulfur-doped carbon coating approach is an effective method to improve the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 and could be extended to modify other electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries."

Partial lung bypass reduces pulmonary edema induced by kerosene aspiration in dogs,"Aaron R. Zucker, L. D. H. Wood, Myriam Curet-Scott, Gregory Crawford, J. Iasha Sznajder, ","Journal of Critical Care, Volume 6, Issue 1, March 1991, Pages 29-35, ","Kerosene aspiration causes severe pulmonary capillary leak in dogs that is reduced by lowering pulmonary vascular pressures with plasmapheresis. In this study, we tested the possibility that partial lung bypass (PLB) with a veno-arterial extracorporeal circuit previously used for membrane oxygenation (ECMO) would decrease kerosene-induced pulmonary edema. Twelve dogs having a stable pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (Ppw) of 10 tort received 0.25 mL/kg of kerosene into each mainstem bronchus. After 1 hour, the dogs were separated into two equal groups: a control group (C) in which Ppw was maintained at 10 torr until 5 hours after injury, and a PLB group in which PLB reduced Ppw to 5 torr, associated with a 25% reduction in pulmonary blood flow. The blood was pumped back into the distal aorta with blood gas tensions matched by ECMO to the values exiting the lungs as sampled in the left ventricle. In the C group, extravascular thermal volume (ETV) increased from 8.7 ㊣ 4.7 mL/kg to 32.9 ㊣ 26.2 mL/kg between 1 and 5 hours postinjury (P < .05). In the PLB group, ETV increased less between 1 hour (11.7 ㊣ 3.3 mL/kg) and 5 hours (16.5 ㊣ 6.8 mL/kg). Therefore, the values at 5 hours were different between the groups (P < .05). The wet lung weight to body weight ratios of lungs excised at 5 hours were also much less (P < .05) in PLB (20 ㊣ 5 mL/kg) than in group C (40 ㊣ 18 mL/kg). We conclude that PLB reduces edema formation during a pulmonary capillary leak state by reducing pulmonary vascular pressures and/or flows. This supports a therapeutic approach to kerosene pneumonitis that seeks the lowest Ppw compatible with adequate cardiac output and oxygen transport, and suggests an additional benefit of the ECMO circuit in pulmonary vascular leak over and above supporting inadequate lung oxygen exchange at reduced FIO2 and oxygen toxicity."
Modified multiscale cross-sample entropy for complex time series,"Yi Yin, Pengjian Shang, Guochen Feng, ","Applied Mathematics and Computation, Volume 289, 20 October 2016, Pages 98-110, ","In this paper, we introduce the composite multiscale cross-sample entropy (CMCSE) which may induce undefined entropies and then further propose the refined composite multiscale cross-sample entropy (RCMCSE) which modifies CMCSE. First, we apply multiscale cross-sample entropy (MCSE), CMCSE and RCMCSE methods to three types of artificial time series in order to test the validity and accuracy of these methods. Results show that RCMCSE reduces not only standard deviation, but also the probability of inducing undefined entropy effectively, which can provide better robustness and more accurate entropies. Then, these three methods are employed to investigate financial time series including US and Chinese stock indices. For the study between stock indices in the same region, some conclusions which are consistent with previous study are drawn by the RCMCSE results. Meanwhile, it can be found that undefined entropies are induced and the numbers of inducing undefined entropy by three methods for investigation between three US stock indices and two Chinese mainland stock indices are given. Compared with MCSE and CMCSE, RCMCSE method is capable of reducing the number of undefined entropy and providing more accurate entropies. Moreover, the differences on inducing undefined entropy between results for US stock indices & two Chinese mainland stock indices and results for US stock indices & HSI demonstrate a much closer relation between US stock markets and HSI than between US stock markets and two Chinese mainland stock markets. Hence, it can be concluded that RCMCSE is more applicable for the study between US and Chinese stock markets."

The carbon quantum dots obtained by microwave treatment of thiourea and citric acid acted as a sensitizer in the composites to enhance light absorption. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) revealed that a closely integrated interface between carbon quantum dots and TiO2 nanosheets was formed in the heterostructured nanocomposites. Furthermore, the photogenerated charge transfer and separation in the heterogeneous nanocomposites were demonstrated to be significantly improved when compared with that in pristine TiO2. Consequently, a remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic activity evaluated for CO2 photoreduction under simulated solar light irradiation can be found in the nanocomposites. Maximum CH4 and CO yields of 0.769 and 1.153 米mol, respectively, have been obtained from the photoreduction after one hour irradiation without any noble metal loaded on photocatalyst. The amounts of CH4 and CO generated over nanocoposite are 7.79 and 7.61 times as high as those on pristine TiO2. This encouraging performance in CO2 photoreduction shows that these nanocomposites might be a prospective material in environmental protection and energy conversion.Download high-res image (86KB)Download full-size image"
Generalized dual-phase lag bioheat equations based on nonequilibrium heat transfer in living biological tissues,"Yuwen Zhang, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 52, Issues 21每22, October 2009, Pages 4829-4834, ","Based on a nonequilibrium heat transfer model in the living tissue obtained by performing volume average to the local instantaneous energy equations for blood and tissues, the dual-phase lag bioheat equations with blood or tissue temperature as sole unknown temperature are obtained by eliminating the tissue or blood temperature from the nonequilibrium model. The present dual-phase model successfully overcame the drawbacks of the existing dual-phase lag bioheat equation obtained by simply modifying the classical Pennes bioheat equation. Under the dual-phase model developed in this work, the phase lag times are expressed in terms of the properties of blood and tissue and the interphase convective heat transfer coefficient and blood perfusion rate. The phase lag times for heat flux and temperature gradient for the living tissue are estimated using the available properties from the literature. It is found that the phase lag times for heat flux and temperature gradient for the living tissue are very close to each other."

A specific rod model based efficient analysis and design of hanger installation for self-anchored suspension bridges with 3D curved cables,"Yuan Sun, Hong-Ping Zhu, Dong Xu, ","Engineering Structures, Volume 110, 1 March 2016, Pages 184-208, ","Hanger installation is important in constructing self-anchored suspension bridges. The installation plan is obtained from comparative studies of concerned information in tentative construction steps. The comparisons are generally performed manually using detailed nonlinear finite element method (NFEM), particularly for those with 3D curved cables. However, the procedure is complex and time consuming. Thus, this study proposes an efficient method to analyze mainly concerned parameters of hanger installation plan, through which automatically optimized strategy of updating ideal construction steps is developed to yield the plan totally by linear coordinate iteration. To realize it, an indiscrimination coordinate rod model (ICRM) combined with coordinate iteration-based methods (CIMs) is proposed for the modeling of the construction steps. The ICRM simulates the major deformation system of the total bridge with specific rods, and then the CIMs identify its equilibrium by linear algorithms to solve the coordinates directly. On the basis, NFEM can be avoided and the design efficiency is greatly improved for the plan. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison case studies, field test verification and application discussion in a real-scale bridge."

Range of knee motion was measured preoperatively and at 1-year review. Validated knee scores and an SF-12 health questionnaire were also recorded.

Measurement of net cost requires estimates of latent demand for advanced communications. This paper seeks for the first time to provide quantitative estimates of the magnitude of latent income pools available to carriers in rural WA. Estimates of latent expenditure on broadband services in rural WA are obtained using a combination of stated-preference and survey data. These expenditures increase with computer ownership, community isolation and information need. Further, the statistical model supports the commonly held belief that more distant populations have stronger information demands and are willing to pay for services. This finding suggests that carrier aversion to providing services to rural regions may not be justified on commercial grounds."
Twin Mahalanobis distance-based support vector machines for pattern recognition,"Xinjun Peng, Dong Xu, ","Information Sciences, Volume 200, 1 October 2012, Pages 22-37, ","Twin support vector machines (TSVMs) achieve fast training speed and good performance for data classification. However, TSVMs do not take full advantage of the statistical information in data, such as the covariance of each class of data. This paper proposes a new twin Mahalanobis distance-based support vector machine (TMSVM) classifier, in which two Mahalanobis distance-based kernels are constructed according to the covariance matrices of two classes of data for optimizing the nonparallel hyperplanes. TMSVMs have a special case of TSVMs when the covariance matrices in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space are degenerated to the identity ones. TMSVMs are suitable for many real problems, especially for the case that the covariance matrices of two classes of data are obviously different. The experimental results on several artificial and benchmark datasets indicate that TMSVMs not only possess fast learning speed, but also obtain better generalization than TSVMs and other methods."
Optimizing parameters to achieve giant deformation of an incompressible dielectric elastomeric plate,"Yipin Su, Bin Wu, Weiqiu Chen, Chaofeng L邦, ","Extreme Mechanics Letters, Volume 22, July 2018, Pages 60-68, ","Snap-through instability can be readily utilized to acquire giant deformation of dielectric elastomeric structures. This study focuses on exploring such utilization by taking account of effects of intrinsic material properties, in addition to the extrinsic means (e.g. pre-deformation) that has been reported. Based on the recently proposed nonlinear formulations of electroelasticity and the so-called Hessian approach, we analyze theoretically the snap-through instability of an incompressible dielectric Gent elastomer plate sandwiched between two compliant electrodes subject to the combined action of electrical voltage and prestress. The snap-through instability occurs because of sudden decrease in the thickness and abrupt increase in the true electric field of the plate, and ceases at a state close to the limiting chain extensibility of the elastomer. By comparing the critical values for onset and stop of snap-through instability and electric breakdown of the elastomer, we study the possibility of using snap-through instability and maximal allowable actuation stretch to achieve large deformation. Three kinds of phase diagram are constructed to reveal the underlying mechanism of how material properties and prestress influence the snap-through instability. The results indicate that material properties and prestress may be tuned properly so as to achieve giant deformation of the plate."

Herein, a computational strategy combining molecular dynamics simulation of the enzyme-substrate complex with binding free energy (忖G) calculations was established to guide the further engineering of PT121Y114S. One His224 residue proximal to the PT121Y114S active site was selected on the basis of the difference in 忖G decomposition of PT121Y114S toward l-Phe-NH2 and l-Phe-OMe. Site-saturation mutagenesis of His224 resulted in the mutants H224D, H224N, and H224S, which showed great improvement in Z-aspartame synthesis under an economical substrate molar ratio approaching 1:1. Furthermore, the kinetic constants of PT121Y114S and its mutants revealed that the affinity of mutants toward the l-Phe-OMe was significantly higher than that of PT121Y114S. Molecular dynamic simulation revealed that the enhanced synthetic activity may be attributed to the mutation stabilizing the transient state of the enzyme-l-Phe-OMe complex.Download high-res image (106KB)Download full-size image"

Despite these differences, three themes were consistently recommended: 1) DT LVAD is a major patient-centered decision: ※you're your best advocate＃ this may not be the best choice for you§; 2) this decision benefits from an iterative, multidisciplinary process: ※It is not a one-time conversation§; and 3) this process involves a tension between conveying enough detail about the process yet not overwhelming patients: ※It's sometimes hard to walk that line to not scare them but not paint a rainbow and butterflies picture.§MCS coordinators endorsed a shared decision-making process that starts early, uses non-biased educational materials, and involves a multidisciplinary team sensitive to the tension between conveying enough detail about the therapy yet not overwhelming patients."
Unequal Living Conditions between Urban Migrants and Local Residents in China,"Yi Zhang, ","Procedia Engineering, Volume 198, 2017, Pages 728-735, ","Although migrants are the majority of increased urban population in China, the most of migrants cannot access the equal local social welfare system as the urban local residents because of the hukou policy (household registration) The migrants are more likely to live in an adverse conditions due to inferior socioeconomic status, which results to the disparity in health status between migrants and local residents. This study compares the unequal living conditions among urban population with 4 different resident statuses based on hukou residence and attributes, I compare the living conditions in terms of traffic, cooking and housing conditions to identify the disparities in the living conditions. The hypothesis is that the migrants＊ living conditions are worse than local residents.The data comes from China Labor-force Dynamics Survey in 2012. It is a nationwide, large-scale, random sampled survey. The survey adopted three-stage stratified sampling and can represent the national population very well. The migrant household is defined as the households whose hukou residences have not be registered in the local cities. The urban population can be divided into (1) local resident household with non-agriculture hukou, (2) local resident household with agriculture hukou, (3) migrant household with non-agriculture hukou, and (4) migrant household with agriculture hukou. The variables about living conditions are compared by means of normal regression for continuous variables, logistical for categorical variables, and order logistic regression for ordinal variables. The results show that migrants with agriculture hukou and local residents with agriculture hukou have inferior living conditions that are significantly different from local residents. This suggests the special policy to adopt to address unequal living conditions in urban areas for policymakers."

The minimum cardinality of an identifying code in a graph G is denoted by 污ID(G). In this paper, we study the identifying code of the direct product Kn℅G, where Kn is a complete graph.

Significance of Electrocardiographic Right Bundle Branch Block in Trained Athletes,"Jonathan H. Kim, Peter A. Noseworthy, David McCarty, Kibar Yared, Aaron L. Baggish, ","The American Journal of Cardiology, Volume 107, Issue 7, 1 April 2011, Pages 1083-1089, ","We sought to determine the clinical and physiologic significance of electrocardiographic complete right bundle branch block (CRBBB) and incomplete right bundle branch block (IRBBB) in trained athletes. The 12-lead electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data from 510 competitive athletes were analyzed. Compared to the 51 age-, sport type-, and gender-matched athletes with normal 12-lead electrocardiographic QRS complex duration, the 44 athletes with IRBBB (9%) and 13 with CRBBB (3%) had larger right ventricular (RV) dimensions, as measured by the basal RV end-diastolic diameter (CRBBB 43 ㊣ 3 mm, IRBBB 38 ㊣ 6 mm, normal QRS complex 35 ㊣ 4 mm, p <0.001) and RV end-diastolic area (CRBBB 33 ㊣ 5, IRBBB 27 ㊣ 7, and normal QRS complex 23 ㊣ 3 cm2; p <0.001). Athletes with CRBBB also had a relative reduction in the RV systolic function at rest as assessed by the RV fractional area change and peak systolic tissue velocity. Finally, QRS prolongation was associated with parallel increases in interventricular dyssynchrony (basal RV to basal lateral left ventricular peak systolic tissue velocity time difference: CRBBB 112 ㊣ 15, IRBBB 73 ㊣ 33, normal QRS complex 43 ㊣ 39 ms, p <0.001). Despite these findings, no athlete with CRBBB or IRBBB was found to have pathologic structural cardiac disease. In conclusion, among trained athletes, CRBBB and IRBBB appear to be markers of a structural and physiological cardiac remodeling triad characterized by RV dilation, a relative reduction in the RV systolic function at rest, and interventricular dyssynchrony."
Performance analysis of a novel thermoelectric assisted indirect evaporative cooling system,"Yuanyuan Zhou, Tao Zhang, Fang Wang, Yanshun Yu, ","Energy, Volume 162, 1 November 2018, Pages 299-308, ","In this paper, a novel thermoelectric assisted indirect evaporative cooling system is proposed. Specifically, thermoelectric cooling (TEC) modules are sandwiched between channels of a flat plate cross flow indirect evaporative cooler. A mathematical model of the novel system is developed, and influences of main operating and geometrical parameters on the system's performance are analyzed in detail. Analytical results show that with the assistance of the thermoelectric cooling, the proposed system is able to cool primary air to a temperature much lower than inlet air wet bulb temperature, even dew-point temperature, meanwhile keep a relatively high coefficient of performance (COP), by selecting appropriate number and electric current of TEC modules. The dew point effectiveness and COP of the proposed system change monotonously with inlet mass flow rate, temperature and humidity ratio of primary air, respectively. The dew point effectiveness also varies monotonously with the mass flow rate ratio of secondary air to primary air. However, there exists an optimal mass flow rate ratio resulting in a maximum COP. Moreover, under variable number and electric current of TEC modules, there always exist optimal widths of primary air channel and secondary air channel, leading to a maximum COP."
Complementarities between R&D investment and exporting〞Evidence from China,"Fang Wang, ","China Economic Review, Volume 31, December 2014, Pages 217-227, ","In view of the importance of deliberate R&D activities in achieving productivity gain via exports for firms in developing economies, this study explores a potential complementarity between firms' decision to export or to invest in R&D empirically. The evidence from Chinese manufacturing firms reveals a complementarity between exporting and R&D investment in their impacts on firm's productivity. The complementarity test is implemented based on the supermodularity theory. After disentangling the selection bias from the decision to export and to invest R&D through mixed multinomial Logit regression, the multinomial treatment effect estimation identifies that the joint decisions improve firms' labor productivity by 0.283. Moreover, the exporting status increases firms＊ tendency to invest in R&D, and vice versa, thus implying the existence of complementarity from the view of firms' decision."
Modified DFA and DCCA approach for quantifying the multiscale correlation structure of financial markets,"Yi Yin, Pengjian Shang, ","Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, Volume 392, Issue 24, 15 December 2013, Pages 6442-6457, ","We use multiscale detrended fluctuation analysis (MSDFA) and multiscale detrended cross-correlation analysis (MSDCCA) to investigate auto-correlation (AC) and cross-correlation (CC) in the US and Chinese stock markets during 1997每2012. The results show that US and Chinese stock indices differ in terms of their multiscale AC structures. Stock indices in the same region also differ with regard to their multiscale AC structures. We analyze AC and CC behaviors among indices for the same region to determine similarity among six stock indices and divide them into four groups accordingly. We choose S&P500, NQCI, HSI, and the Shanghai Composite Index as representative samples for simplicity. MSDFA and MSDCCA results and average MSDFA spectra for local scaling exponents (LSEs) for individual series are presented. We find that the MSDCCA spectrum for LSE CC between two time series generally tends to be greater than the average MSDFA LSE spectrum for individual series. We obtain detailed multiscale structures and relations for CC between the four representatives. MSDFA and MSDCCA with secant rolling windows of different sizes are then applied to reanalyze the AC and CC. Vertical and horizontal comparisons of different window sizes are made. The MSDFA and MSDCCA results for the original window size are confirmed and some new interesting characteristics and conclusions regarding multiscale correlation structures are obtained."

We aimed to understand the burden of disease and outcomes in children with life-threatening bacterial infections in Europe.The European Union Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS) was a prospective, multicentre, cohort study done in six countries in Europe. Patients aged 1 month to 18 years with sepsis (or suspected sepsis) or severe focal infections, admitted to 98 participating hospitals in the UK, Austria, Germany, Lithuania, Spain, and the Netherlands were prospectively recruited between July 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2015. To assess disease burden and outcomes, we collected demographic and clinical data using a secured web-based platform and obtained microbiological data using locally available clinical diagnostic procedures.2844 patients were recruited and included in the analysis. 1512 (53﹞2%) of 2841 patients were male and median age was 39﹞1 months (IQR 12﹞4每93﹞9). 1229 (43﹞2%) patients had sepsis and 1615 (56﹞8%) had severe focal infections. Patients diagnosed with sepsis had a median age of 27﹞6 months (IQR 9﹞0每80﹞2), whereas those diagnosed with severe focal infections had a median age of 46﹞5 months (15﹞8每100﹞4; p<0﹞0001). Of 2844 patients in the entire cohort, the main clinical syndromes were pneumonia (511 [18﹞0%] patients), CNS infection (469 [16﹞5%]), and skin and soft tissue infection (247 [8﹞7%]). The causal microorganism was identified in 1359 (47﹞8%) children, with the most prevalent ones being Neisseria meningitidis (in 259 [9﹞1%] patients), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (in 222 [7﹞8%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (in 219 [7﹞7%]), and group A streptococcus (in 162 [5﹞7%]). 1070 (37﹞6%) patients required admission to a paediatric intensive care unit. Of 2469 patients with outcome data, 57 (2﹞2%) deaths occurred: seven were in patients with severe focal infections and 50 in those with sepsis.Mortality in children admitted to hospital for sepsis or severe focal infections is low in Europe. The disease burden is mainly in children younger than 5 years and is largely due to vaccine-preventable meningococcal and pneumococcal infections. Despite the availability and application of clinical procedures for microbiological diagnosis, the causative organism remained unidentified in approximately 50% of patients.European Union's Seventh Framework programme."
Comparison of Growing Rod Instrumentation Versus Serial Cast Treatment for Early-Onset Scoliosis,"Charles E. Johnston, Anna M. McClung, George H. Thompson, Connie Poe-Kochert, Growing Spine Study Group, ","Spine Deformity, Volume 1, Issue 5, September 2013, Pages 339-342, ","A comparison of 2 methods of early-onset scoliosis treatment using radiographic measures and complication rates.To determine whether a delaying tactic (serial casting) has comparable efficacy to a surgical method (insertion of growing rod instrumentation [GRI]) in the initial phase of early-onset deformity management.Serial casts are used in experienced centers to delay operative management of curves of surgical magnitude (greater than 50∼) in children up to age 6 years.A total of 27 casted patients from 3 institutions were matched with 27 patients from a multicenter database according to age (within 6 months of each other), curve magnitude (within 10∼ of each other), and diagnosis. Outcomes were compared according to major curve magnitude, spine length (T1每S1), duration and number of treatment encounters, and complications.There was no difference in age (5.5 years) or initial curve magnitude (65∼) between groups, which reflects the accuracy of the matching process. Six pairs of patients had neuromuscular diagnoses, 11 had idiopathic deformities, and 10 had syndromic scoliosis. Growing rod instrumentation patients had smaller curves (45.9∼ vs. 64.9∼; p = .002) at follow-up, but there was no difference in absolute spine length (GRI = 32.0 cm; cast = 30.6 cm; p = .26), even though GRI patients had been under treatment for a longer duration (4.5 vs. 2.4 years; p < .0001) and had undergone a mean of 5.5 lengthenings compared with 4.0 casts. Growing rod instrumentation patients had a 44% complication rate, compared with 1 cast complication. Of 27 casted patients, 15 eventually had operative treatment after a mean delay of 1.7 years after casting.Cast treatment is a valuable delaying tactic for younger children with early-onset scoliosis. Spine deformity is adequately controlled, spine length is not compromised, and surgical complications associated with early GRI treatment are avoided."
Interleukin-7 augments CD8+ T cells function and promotes viral clearance in chronic hepatitis C virus infection,"Huanrong Hou, Yi Kang, Yanli Zeng, Yukui Li, Jia Shang, ","Cytokine, Volume 102, February 2018, Pages 26-33, ","Interleukin (IL)-7 is a potent proliferation, activation, and survival cytokine for CD8+ T cells to improve viral and tumor specific CD8+ T cell responses. However, the role of IL-7 in regulation of dysfunctional hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD8+ T cells was not fully elucidated. Thus, a total of 53 patients with chronic hepatitis C and 24 healthy individuals were enrolled in the current study. Serum IL-7 and its receptor 汐 chain CD127 expression was measured. The modulatory function of IL-7 to CD8+ T cells was investigated in both direct and indirect contact co-culture with HCVcc-infected Huh7.5 cells. Both serum IL-7 and CD127 expression on CD8+ T cells was significantly reduced in chronic HCV-infected patients, which was negatively correlated with HCV RNA. Stimulation of IL-7 promoted both cytotoxicity and cytokines (interferon-污, tumor necrosis factor-汐, and IL-2) production of CD8+ T cells from patients with chronic hepatitis C. Moreover, IL-7 increased proliferation of CD8+ T cells, while downregulated a critical repressor of cytokine signaling, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). The IL-7-mediated enhancement effects to CD8+ T cells were dependent on IL-6 production. The current data suggested that IL-7 induced both cytolytic and noncytolytic functions of CD8+ T cells probably via repression of SOCS3. IL-7 might be considered as one of the therapeutic candidates for treatment of chronic HCV infection."
Comparative case study of legislative attempts to require private well testing in New Jersey and Maine,"Sara V. Flanagan, Yan Zheng, ","Environmental Science & Policy, Volume 85, July 2018, Pages 40-46, ","At present one of the greatest barriers to reducing exposure to naturally occurring arsenic from unregulated private well water is a lack of well testing. The New Jersey Private Well Testing Act (PWTA) has since 2002 required testing during real estate transactions. Due to limitations in relying on individual well owners to take protective actions, such state-wide testing regulations have been shown to make a significant contribution towards exposure reduction. This study examines the New Jersey PWTA as a case of testing requirements successfully adopted into law, and failed attempts to pass equivalent requirements in Maine for comparison. Although New Jersey＊s long history of drinking water quality problems due to population density, an industrial past, and vulnerable aquifers was the root of the PWTA and earlier local testing ordinances, several high-profile events immediately prior focused public and legislator attention and mobilized environmental advocacy groups to gain political support statewide. Viewed through Kingdon＊s Multiple Streams framework, the PWTA was the result of problem, policy, and politics streams successfully aligned during a significant and unique political window of opportunity. In Maine, where naturally occurring arsenic, not industrial contamination, is the primary concern, private sector opposition and a conservative administration resistant to government involvement in ※private§ well water, all played a role in blocking legislative attempts to require testing. A modest education and outreach bill without testing mandates passed in 2017 after compromise among stakeholders. For policy to be an effective tool to achieve universal well water screening, a philosophical evolution on the role of government in private water may be necessary."

One innovation from this research is a multi-axis dynamic mold clamping system, which allows for a discussion of the anisotropic asymmetric dynamic regulation microstructure within the elastic range; controls its appearance characteristics effectively within the elastic range of the microstructure soft mold materials; deduces the appearance characteristics after multi-axis dynamic regulation transfer through the mathematical and geometrical principles; and makes a comparison with the result after the actual impression. The result shows that the composite soft mold proposed in this experiment has a better material mechanical property versus the traditional soft mold, and that the dual-axis dynamic clamping system developed and designed in this research can effectively regulate the microstructure dynamically. Finally, the deduced forecast method also conforms to the experiment result and provides more microstructure-oriented usage and innovation procedures for application in the microstructure industry."
Safety monitoring of exothermic reactions using time derivatives of temperature sensors,"Z. C. Feng, Yuwen Zhang, ","Applied Thermal Engineering, Volume 66, Issues 1每2, May 2014, Pages 346-354, ",We propose a new method of safety monitoring for overheating in exothermic reactions that is applicable to detection of thermal runaway in Li-ion batteries. The proposed method is based on the solutions of a one-dimensional heat conduction problem across the wall thickness of a cylinder. The problem is known as an Inverse Heat Conduction Problem (IHCP) since heat is conducted outwards while monitoring sensors only have access to the outside surface. We first obtain the transfer functions relating the inner and outer boundaries through Laplace transform. We then use Hadamard factorization theorem to express the transfer functions in terms of infinite product of polynomials. Truncations of the polynomial transfer functions represent time domain relationships between physically accessible measurements and the heating inside a cylindrical wall. These relationships lead us to propose time derivatives of temperature as better indicators for safety monitoring in exothermic processes.
A unified constitutive model based on dislocation density for an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy at time-variant hot deformation conditions,"Y. C. Lin, Wen-Yong Dong, Mi Zhou, Dong-Xu Wen, Dong-Dong Chen, ","Materials Science and Engineering: A, Volume 718, 7 March 2018, Pages 165-172, ","In order to study the flow behaviors of an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy at elevated temperatures, uniaxial tensile tests were carried out in wide deformation temperature and strain rate ranges. The flow stress rapidly increases to a peak value and then slightly decreases with the increased strain, and the dynamic recovery (DRV) is the primary softening mechanism. A unified constitutive model based on dislocation density was developed. An iterative procedure was implemented into the developed model to describe the flow behaviors at time-variant deformation conditions (e.g. the strain rate is changed during hot deformation). The predicted flow stresses were in accord with the experimental results, suggesting that the flow behaviors of the studied Al alloy at elevated temperatures can be well reproduced by the developed model. Meanwhile, the variations of the product of the instantaneous work hardening (WH) rate and stress caused by dislocation evolution, the dislocation density changing rate, as well as the dislocation mean free path, were given to analyze the WH and DRV mechanisms of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy."
A novel precise guiding method for visual guiding theodolite measurement in volume space,"Bin Wu, Xiaoyue Su, ","Optik - International Journal for Light and Electron Optics, Volume 126, Issue 23, December 2015, Pages 3969-3973, ","This article reports a novel precise guiding method for visual guiding theodolite measurement in volume space.

We put forward a precise guiding method based on the camera optical axis. After being calibrated, the double-theodolite measuring subsystem and vision guiding subsystem are triggered by theoretical model data. Then by using the digital image processing technology, we can obtain the relation between the feature center in the camera view and the image center (the camera optical axis). With this relation and the multiresolution visual imaging and tracking technology, the vision measurement subsystem can be guided to target the feature center precisely. According to the calibration relation, we can obtain the angular deflection of double theodolites and make the double theodolites to intersect at the target point precisely. The method improves the automatic measurement efficiency at no cost of measurement accuracy."

Three types of cubic natural convection problems are solved with proposed method at various Rayleigh numbers. Two opposite vertical walls on the left and right are kept at different temperatures for all three types, while the remained four walls are either adiabatic or have linear temperature variations. For the first two types of cubic natural convections that four walls are either adiabatic or vary linearly, the present results agreed very well with the benchmark solutions or experimental results in the literature. For the third type of cubic natural convection, the front and back surfaces has linearly variable temperature while the bottom and top surface are adiabatic. The results from the third type exhibited more general three-dimensional characters."

Furthermore, the array aperture of IEAS-NA is always greater than the corresponding EAS structure, which helps improving the DOA estimation result.

Finite element simulation and experimental validation of distortion and cracking failure phenomena in direct metal laser sintering fabricated component,"Yi Zhang, Jing Zhang, ","Additive Manufacturing, Volume 16, August 2017, Pages 49-57, ","A new one-way coupled thermal-mechanical finite element based model of direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) is developed to simulate the process, and predict distortion and cracking failure location in the fabricated components. The model takes into account the layer-by-layer additive manufacturing features, solidification and melting phenomena. The model is first validated using experimental data, then model is applied to a DMLS fabricated component. The study shows how the stress distribution at the support-solid interface is critical to contributing to cracking and distortion. During the DMLS process, thermal stress at the support-solid interface reaches its maximum during the printing process, particularly when the first solid layer is built above the support layer. This result suggests that cracking at the interface may occur during the printing process, which is consistent with experimental observation. Using a design parametric study, a thick and low-density porous layer is found to reduce residual stress and distortion in the built component. The developed finite element model can be used to future design and optimize DMLS process."
The influence of parameters of disk electrode with guard electrode system and sample on permittivity error caused by equivalent electrode area calculation and its correction method,"Zhiniu Xu, Yi Zhang, Yijie Zhang, ","Measurement, Volume 129, December 2018, Pages 37-50, ","To improve the accuracy in the permittivity measurement using disk electrode with guard electrode, a 3D model of this type of electrode is built in Comsol software and validated. The influence of parameters of sample and disk electrode with guard electrode system on the permittivity error caused by equivalent electrode area calculation is systematically investigated. The results reveal that the permittivity errors by means of the equivalent electrode area presented by the IEC 60250 standard are nearly always negative. From a global perspective, the area of the guarded electrode is closer to the accurate equivalent electrode area than the area provided by the IEC 60250 standard. The error decreases with increasing sample thickness and increases with increasing sample permittivity, gap width, radius of the electrode corner. If the sample is thick and the permittivity is low, the error increases significantly with increasing guarded electrode potential. The sample radius has nothing to do with the accuracy if it is slightly larger than the inside radius of the guard electrode. In the normal range, the size of shielding box, the electrode location, the deviation between the guarded electrode and the whole electrode center, the deviation between the guard electrode and the unguarded electrode, and the potential of the bolt have little effect on the accuracy. Based on the model, a permittivity correction method based on interpolation is proposed. First, the models with different parameters of electrode system and sample, measured and real values of permittivity are built. Second, the relationship among parameters of electrode system and sample is obtained. Finally, the measured permittivity can be corrected by using the relationship and the interpolation method. The accuracy in the permittivity measurement is greatly improved. Because of taking potential of guarded electrode and radius of the electrode corner into account, the error introduced by the proposed method is less than that of the existing correction methods in some situations."
"Auditory lexical decision, categorical perception, and FM direction discrimination differentially engage left and right auditory cortex","David Poeppel, Andre Guillemin, Jennifer Thompson, Jonathan Fritz, Allen R Braun, ","Neuropsychologia, Volume 42, Issue 2, 2004, Pages 183-200, ","Recent neuroimaging and neuropsychological data suggest that speech perception is supported in bilaterally auditory areas. We evaluate this issue building on well-known behavioral effects. While undergoing positron emission tomography (PET), subjects performed standard auditory tasks: direction discrimination of frequency-modulated (FM) tones, categorical perception (CP) of consonant每vowel (CV) syllables, and word/non-word judgments (lexical decision, LD). Compared to rest, the three conditions led to bilateral activation of the auditory cortices. However, lateralization patterns differed as a function of stimulus type: the LD task generated stronger responses in the left, the FM task a stronger response in the right hemisphere. Contrasts between either words or syllables versus FM were associated with significantly greater activity bilaterally in superior temporal gyrus (STG) ventro-lateral to Heschl＊s gyrus. These activations extended into the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and were greater in the left. The same areas were more active in the LD than the CP task. In contrast, the FM task was associated with significantly greater activity in the right lateral每posterior STG and lateral MTG. The findings argue for a view in which speech perception is mediated bilaterally in the auditory cortices and that the well-documented lateralization is likely associated with processes subsequent to the auditory analysis of speech."

Thompson, ","Clinics in Sports Medicine, Volume 16, Issue 4, 1 October 1997, Pages 725-737, ","The development of the athlete's heart is a fascinating phenomenon produced by physiologic adaptations to the increased demands of exercise. The syndrome of the athlete's heart includes cardiac hypertrophy and bradycardia as well as other physiologic and morphologic manifestations. Our purpose is to highlight these manifestations in the young athlete and to discuss the cardiovascular complications that may arise in this patient population. Our ultimate goal is to educate the primary caregiver and thereby facilitate the appropriate evaluation and treatment of cardiovascular findings in young, athletic patients.Henschen first described the athlete's heart in the late nineteenth century.5, 58 He compared the cardiovascular examination of competitive cross-country skiers with that of sedentary controls. Henschen hypothesized that cardiac enlargement in his cohort of skiers was a normal, beneficial response to exercise. Scientists debated this theory throughout the twentieth century, some arguing that the cardiac enlargement seen in athletes was pathologic dilatation resulting from overexertion, possibly in hearts with pre-existing disease. Henschen's original theory, however, has proved correct.How are normal adaptations in athletes differentiated from the pathologic? Although physical activity has unquestionably been shown to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, there remains a small but definable cardiovascular risk with exercise.55, 65 This risk has been underscored by several recent, highly publicized deaths of nationally known athletes. Such events have sensitized physicians and other caregivers to the importance of diagnosing cardiovascular abnormalities in athletes and thereby preventing these exercise complications. The following principles can be applied to the syndrome of the athlete's heart and sudden cardiac death during exercise:※Abnormalities§ uncovered during the routine cardiac screening of asymptomatic, healthy athletes are usually variants of normal. Identified physical findings are typically manifestations of the athletic heart syndrome. The cardiac adaptations seen with endurance training and described later produce most of the ※abnormal§ findings.5, 25, 28 As mentioned previously, these adaptations rarely exceed the upper limits of normal; however, caregivers of athletes should never ignore cardiac symptoms or significant findings on evaluation.3. Cardiac symptoms and strikingly abnormal physical findings even in healthy athletes require a prompt evaluation by a cardiovascular expert.16, 35, 40, 57, 67 Undoubtedly, the most sensitive screening tool for diagnosing a cardiac abnormality in an athlete is the careful history and examination he or she receives prior to athletic participation."
Quantitative analysis of a biopharmaceutical protein in cell culture samples using automated capillary electrophoresis (CE) western blot,"Dong Xu, Kentaro Marchionni, Yunli Hu, Wei Zhang, Zoran Sosic, ","Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis, Volume 145, 25 October 2017, Pages 10-15, ","An effective control strategy is critical to ensure the safety, purity and potency of biopharmaceuticals. Appropriate analytical tools are needed to realize such goals by providing information on product quality at an early stage to help understanding and control of the manufacturing process. In this work, a fully automated, multi-capillary instrument is utilized for size-based separation and western blot analysis to provide an early readout on product quality in order to enable a more consistent manufacturing process. This approach aims at measuring two important qualities of a biopharmaceutical protein, titer and isoform distribution, in cell culture harvest samples. The acquired data for isoform distribution can then be used to predict the corresponding values of the final drug substance, and potentially provide information for remedy through timely adjustment of the downstream purification process, should the expected values fall out of the accepted range."
Analysis of nanofluid effects on thermoelectric cooling by micro-pin-fin heat exchangers,"Shahabeddin K. Mohammadian, Yuwen Zhang, ","Applied Thermal Engineering, Volume 70, Issue 1, 5 September 2014, Pages 282-290, ","In this study, two micro-pin-fin heat exchangers (MPFHEXs) were modeled and used on both hot and cold surfaces of a thermoelectric module to analyze the effects of Al2O3每water nanofluids on the performance of thermoelectric module. The results showed that in low Reynolds numbers adding low volume fraction of nanoparticles to the base fluid in hot surface heat exchanger leads to significant increase in coefficient of performance (COP) of the thermoelectric module and decreases total entropy generation; in high Reynolds numbers adding nanoparticles to the base fluid of cold surface heat exchanger increases the COP and decreases the total entropy generation. Furthermore decreasing the nanoparticles diameter has no effects in low Reynolds numbers but in high Reynolds numbers, it results in significant increase in COP and decreases total entropy generation in cold surface heat exchanger; however, in hot surface heat exchanger, reverse trend is observed."
"Method development for detecting the novel cyanide antidote dimethyl trisulfide from blood and brain, and its interaction with blood","L車r芍nd Kiss, Secondra Holmes, Ching-En Chou, Xinmei Dong, David E. Thompson, ","Journal of Chromatography B, Volumes 1044每1045, 15 February 2017, Pages 149-157, ","The antidotal potency of dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) against cyanide poisoning was discovered and investigated in our previous studies. Based on our results it has better efficacy than the Cyanokit and the Nithiodote therapies that are presently used against cyanide intoxication in the US. Because of their absence in the literature, the goal of this work was to develop analytical methods for determining DMTS from blood and brain that could be employed in future pharmacokinetic studies. An HPLC-UV method for detection of DMTS from blood, a GC每MS method for detection of DMTS from brain, and associated validation experiments are described here. These analytical methods were developed using in vitro spiking of brain and blood, and are suitable for determining the in vivo DMTS concentrations in blood and brain in future pharmacokinetic and distribution studies. An important phenomenon was observed in the process of developing these methods. Specifically, recoveries from fresh blood spiked with DMTS were found to be significantly lower than recoveries from aged blood spiked in the same manner with DMTS. This decreased DMTS recovery from fresh blood is important, both because of the role it may play in the antidotal action of DMTS in the presence of cyanide, and because it adds the requirement of sample stabilization to the method development process. Mitigation procedures for stabilizing DMTS samples in blood are reported."

Multiple tolerances dilute the second order cooperative dilemma,"Xiukai Sui, Bin Wu, Long Wang, ","Physics Letters A, Volume 381, Issue 45, 6 December 2017, Pages 3785-3797, ","A peer punisher directly imposes fines upon defectors at a cost to himself. It is one of the mechanisms promoting cooperation, which is ubiquitous in nature. Typically, it is assumed that a peer punisher punishes provided that there is one defector in the group. The threshold that triggers punishment, however, is not necessarily one. The larger the threshold is, the more tolerant the peer punisher is. We study the evolutionary dynamics of those diverse tolerant peer punishment strategies in public goods game. We find that, i) less tolerant punishers prevail over tolerant ones; ii) large group size could enhance punishment, in contrast with the case in the first-order cooperative dilemma. Our analytical results are based on weak selection limit and large population size, which are verified by simulations. Our work sheds light on how punishment of diverse tolerance evolves."

This instrument has the potential to prepare selected cavities without the need for local anesthesia (LA). Patient acceptance has not been investigated in a clinical trial.In this open-label clinical study, the authors enrolled 20 subjects with two Class I carious lesions and randomly assigned them to receive one restoration with the polymer instrument and no LA and the second restoration with a carbide bur and LA. Both procedures were completed in one appointment. Subjects completed dental history, dental anxiety and situational pain questionnaires. At specific points during the procedure, subjects rated their perception of the intensity of cold, heat, pain, pressure, vibration, fear and anxiety. On completion of the restorative procedures and at 48-hour and one-week telephone contacts, subjects indicated which procedure they preferred.During treatment with the polymer instrument, subjects indicated that they experienced slightly more pain, pressure, vibration and anxiety, but not more heat, cold or fear. Immediately after the procedure, 14 (70 percent) of 20 respondents (binomial test; P = .11) said that they would prefer having no LA and use of the polymer instrument for future dental work. The number of subjects indicating this preference increased to 15 (P < .05) at both the 48-hour and one-week contacts. One subject requested rescue LA during the polymer instrument treatment.A significant number of subjects preferred the rotary polymer instrumentation with no LA to the carbide bur instrumentation with LA. They held this preference despite experiencing slightly, but reliably, more pain and pressure when treated with the polymer instrument.A polymer (bur-like) rotary instrument with cutting ability limited to infected dentin can be used in Class I cavity preparations without the need for LA."

With the rapid development of ultralarge-scale integration circuits (ULSI) to high-speed transmission and high integration in the semiconductor industry, and the continuing miniaturization in the dimensions of microelectronic devices, an urgent need for low- and ultralow-百 dielectric materials (low-百: 百 ≒ 2.5; ultralow-百: 百 ≒ 2.0) has arisen. Compared with inorganic dielectric materials, soluble aromatic polyimides often have lower dielectric constants due to the lower materials density and lower individual bond polarizability. Soluble polyimides with ultralow dielectric constants are of great significance. The structures and solubility of aromatic polyimides have been discussed in detail. The design, preparation, and properties of low-百 dielectric constant polyimide materials, especially focusing on the methods for achieving the low-百 properties have been introduced. The methods for achieving low-百 polyimides have been systematically discussed, especially regarding the design and synthesis of polyimides with porous structures, and of intrinsic low-百 polyimides, etc."
International research collaboration: An emerging domain of innovation studies?,"Kaihua Chen, Yi Zhang, Xiaolan Fu, ","Research Policy, In press, corrected proof, Available online 22 August 2018, ","International research collaboration (IRC) has been increasingly important as an emerging area of innovation studies. This study reviews the intellectual base, main research trajectories and intellectual communities of the IRC research domain over the period 1957每2015. It integrates qualitative review and three quantitative analyses including co-citation network analysis, main path analysis and bibliographic coupling analysis. The results show that the IRC research has gone through three phases, namely, ※emergence§ (1957每1991), ※fermentation§ (1992每2005) and ※take-off§ (2006每2015) phases. The co-citation network analysis confirms that the IRC research field has been developed under the influence of two pioneering studies related to bibliometrics research. The main research trajectories in IRC studies over the three development phases and over the whole period are identified based on the main path analysis, which shows that co-authorship analysis is the main research method in IRC studies. A bibliographic coupling analysis suggests that the whole IRC research domain can be classified into five distinct intellectual areas: drivers of IRC, IRC patterns, IRC effects, IRC networks and IRC measurement. Seven topics for future research are also identified."
A comparison of growth rates of normal thoroughbred foals and foals diagnosed with cervical vertebral malformation,"S. J. Ruff, C. H. Wood, D. K. Aaron, L. M. Lawrence, ","Journal of Equine Veterinary Science, Volume 13, Issue 10, October 1993, Pages 596-599, ","The objectives of this study were to compare the growth rates of normal thoroughbred foals to previously reported growth rates1 and to compare growth rates of normal foals with foals diagnosed with cervical vertebral malformation (CVM). Fifty-six foals from two foals crops were used, and eight of these foals were diagnosed with CVM. Growth rate analysis of the CVM foals had to be restricted to the period prior to diagnosis because once these foals were diagnosed, they were treated differently from the normal foals. Body measurements taken at 7 day intervals were body weight, wither height, hip height, and heart girth. For statistical analysis, data were broken down into 30 day intervals. Results showed that the growth rates for normal thoroughbred foals have not changed in the past fifteen years. The CVM foals tended to be heavier and taller during some time intervals than the normal foals, but there were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the skeletal growth measurements. Body weight gain was faster in CVM foals from 31每60 d (p<.01), 121每150 d (p<.01), and 211每240 d (P 每.05)."

Improvements to air mass calculations for ground-based infrared measurements,"Arndt Meier, Aaron Goldman, Paul S. Manning, Thomas M. Stephen, Stephen W. Wood, ","Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer, Volume 83, Issue 1, 1 January 2004, Pages 109-113, ","High-resolution ground-based infrared solar spectra are routinely recorded at the Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC) stations. These data sets play a key role in providing a long-term record of atmospheric composition and their links to climate change. The analysis of observed infrared spectra involves comparison to a computer-modeled atmosphere where knowledge of the air mass distribution is an essential component. This note summarises improvements made to an existing and widely used computer code (FSCATM) to perform refractive ray-tracing and calculation of the air mass distribution. Changes were made towards higher vertical resolution in the troposphere and increased numerical precision. The revised FSCATM improves the analysis of infrared spectra mostly through the more accurate representation of the temperature profile. Air mass differences with respect to earlier versions are documented and are typically <0.7%, exceptions being extreme cases of inversion layers. The current version provides ray tracing and air mass calculations for any terrestrial observation site. The output files are reported in a format compatible with the SFIT and SFIT2 retrieval algorithms, which are widely used for NDSC infrared atmospheric studies. The improved computer code, documentation, reference profiles, and test cases are available electronically."

Multi-objective optimization for rebalancing virtual machine placement,"Rui Li, Qinghua Zheng, Xiuqi Li, Zheng Yan, ","Future Generation Computer Systems, In press, corrected proof, Available online 8 September 2017, ","Load balancer, as a key component in cloud computing, seeks to improve the performance of a distributed system by allocating workload amongst a set of cooperating hosts. A good balancing strategy would make the distributed system efficient and enhance user satisfaction. However, the balance of Host Machines (HMs) in a real cloud environment often breaks due to frequently occurred addition and removal of Virtual Machines (VMs). Therefore, it is essential to schedule the VMs to be reBalanced (VMrB). In this paper, we first summarize and analyze the existing studies on load rebalancing. We then propose a novel solution to the VMrB problem, namely a Pareto-based Multi-Objective VM reBalance solution (MOVMrB), which aims to simultaneously minimize the disequilibrium of both inter-HM and intra-HM loads. It is one of the first solutions that leverages the inter-HM and intra-HM loads and applies a multiple objective optimization strategy to overcome the virtual machine rebalance problem. In our work, we keep migration cost in mind and propose a hybrid VM live migration algorithm that significantly reduces the I/O complexity of VMrB processing. The proposed rebalancing solution is evaluated based on two synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets under a CloudSim framework. Our experimental results show that MOVMrB outperforms other existing multi-objective solutions and also demonstrate its extensibility to support complex scenarios in cloud computing."

The results showed that despite of heat sinks with uniform pin fin heights that increase the standard deviation of the temperature field, using this kind of pin fin heat sink compare to the heat sink without pin fins not only decreases the bulk temperature inside the battery, but also decreases the standard deviation of the temperature field inside the battery as well. Increasing the inlet air temperature leads to decreasing the standard deviation of the temperature field while increases the maximum temperature of the battery. Furthermore, increasing the inlet air velocity first increases the standard deviation of the temperature field till reaches to the maximum point, and after that decreases. Also, increasing the inlet air velocity leads to decrease in the maximum temperature of the battery."

By imposing thermostats to keep constant temperatures of the nanoscale thin layers, the initial thermal non-equilibrium between the neighboring layers is established under the vacuum condition. Models with variable gap distances with an interval of lattice constant increment of the simulated materials are set up and statistical comparisons of temperature evolution curves are made. The equilibration time from non-equilibrium state to thermal equilibrium state of different silicon or/and germanium layers combinations are calculated. The results show significant distinctions of heat transfer under different materials and temperatures combinations. Further discussions on the equilibrium time are made to explain the simulation results. As the first work of the atomic scale energy transport spanning from heat conduction to thermal radiation, the simulation results highlight the promising application of the first-principles molecular dynamics in thermal engineering."

In the prediction stage, BDTWSVMs assign to the class label depending on the kernel density degree-based distances from each test point to the two hyperplanes. BDTWSVMs not only inherit good properties from twin support vector machines (TWSVMs) but also give good description for data points.

Surface modification of SERS substrates with plasma-polymerized trimethylsilane nanocoating,"Young Jo Kim, Xin Sun, John E. Jones, Mengshi Lin, Hao Li, ","Applied Surface Science, Volume 331, 15 March 2015, Pages 346-352, ","Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates were modified by depositing a nanometer-thick polymer coating on top of SERS-active surface. This thin hydrophobic nanocoating, achieved by low temperature plasma polymerization of trimethylsilane, was found to reduce surface energy of SERS substrate and in turn help relieve the analyte spreading on the surface of SERS substrates. Detection of melamine molecules with these surface-modified SERS substrates showed that this plasma nanocoating improved, not significantly though, SERS sensitivity in comparison with unmodified SERS substrates. It is believed that the increased hydrophobicity induced by this plasma nanocoating had two folds of beneficial effects on SERS sensitivity. First, the as-produced hydrophobic surface gave rise to preconcentration effect due to the reduced contact area between analyte molecules and the substrate surface. Second, the decreased surface energy of SERS substrates was helpful in placing analyte molecules in SERS hot spots. These two combined gains were deemed to outweigh the loss of SERS sensitivity caused by enlarged distance between metal surface and analyte molecules."

Measurements were recorded during each year of the study to determine the impact of targeted attempts to improve efficiency.Four hundred sixty-seven of 510 participants had transthoracic echocardiographic images that were technically adequate for complete interpretation (imaging success rate, 92%). Echocardiographic evidence of physiologic, exercise-induced cardiac remodeling was observed in 110 of 510 (22%). Cardiac abnormalities with relevance to sports participation risk were detected in 11 of 508 participants (2.2%).

Strategic behavior and admission control of cognitive radio systems with imperfect sensing,"Jinting Wang, Fang Wang, Wei Wayne Li, ","Computer Communications, Volume 113, 15 November 2017, Pages 53-61, ","This paper conducts the game-theoretic analysis of the behavior of secondary users (SUs) in a cognitive radio (CR) system with a single primary user (PU) band and sensing failures. It is assumed that the sensing errors occur only when an SU is being served by the PU band. It may incorrectly detect there is no PU accessing to the band (called misdetection), or it may wrongly sense that there is an incoming PU but in fact it is not true (called false alarm). When a misdetection occurs, the PU will be blocked and the ongoing SU will drop into a retrial pool called orbit in which it can retry for service after some random time. When a false alarm occurs, the ongoing SU will drop into the retrial orbit. That is, both errors will degrade the quality of service of the system. First, we investigate how the arriving SUs make decisions on whether to join or balk the system which can be studied as a non-cooperative game. We obtain the equilibrium behavior of SUs who want to maximize their benefit in a selfish distributed manner. Second, we derive the socially optimal strategies of SUs from the perspective of the social planner. To use the PU band more efficiently, an appropriate admission fee imposed on each joining SU is proposed based on the gap between the equilibrium strategy and the socially optimal strategy. Finally, theoretic results are validated by numerical analysis and the effect of various parameters on the behavior of SUs is illustrated."
Economic benefit analysis of joint operation of cascaded reservoirs,"Shibao Lu, Yizi Shang, Wei Li, Yi Peng, Xiaohe Wu, ","Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 179, 1 April 2018, Pages 731-737, ","The joint operation of cascaded reservoirs can generate various compensation benefits. How to calculate all compensation benefits scientifically and fairly, and how to share these benefits reasonably, will be of great importance for the sustainable development of the basin and for the rolling development of a cascaded reservoir of a hydropower station. This article examines the joint operation of Longyangxia and Liujiaxia reservoirs at the upper reaches of the Yellow River in China. To study the reservoir compensation benefits, the authors have built a compensative regulation model for the joint operation of the reservoir group. The electricity generation compensation economic effects of the joint operation of the Longyangxia and Liujiaxia reservoirs in 2005 were calculated. The results showed that the joint operation of cascaded reservoirs can generate remarkable economic benefits."
Strategic behavior and social optimization in a double-ended queue with gated policy,"Fang Wang, Jinting Wang, Zhe George Zhang, ","Computers & Industrial Engineering, Volume 114, December 2017, Pages 264-273, ","This paper is concerned with a double-ended queueing system which is motivated by the passenger-taxi problem under a gated policy. This policy makes taxis start to balk when the taxi queue length reaches an upper limit and to join again when the taxi queue length is reduced to a lower limit. In our model, we focus on the strategic behavior and social optimal strategies of arriving passengers under three information scenarios: (a) unobservable case; (b) almost unobservable case; and (c) observable case. In the unobservable and the almost unobservable cases, we derive the equilibrium joining strategies for arriving passengers and analyze the social welfare optimization problems. In the observable case, we consider the pure threshold-type policies from the perspectives of individual＊s strategic behavior and the social welfare optimization, respectively. Then, we present some numerical examples to show how the gated policy plays an important role from the social planner＊s point of view. Some comparisons between our policy with those studied in the literature have been made and some advantages of our policy are demonstrated."
Complicated biallelic inactivation of Pten in radiation-induced mouse thymic lymphomas,"Yu Yamaguchi, Takashi Takabatake, Shizuko Kakinuma, Yoshiko Amasaki, Yoshiya Shimada, ","Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis, Volume 686, Issues 1每2, 1 April 2010, Pages 30-38, ","Inactivation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (Pten) occurs via multiple tissue-dependent mechanisms including epigenetic silencing, point mutations, insertions, and deletions. Although frequent loss of heterozygosity around the Pten locus and plausible involvement of epigenetic silencing have been reported in radiation-induced thymic lymphomas, the proportion of lymphomas with inactivated Pten and the spectrum of causal aberrations have not been extensively characterized. Here, we assessed the mode of Pten inactivation by comprehensive analysis of the expression and alteration of Pten in 23 radiation-induced thymic lymphomas developed in B6C3F1 mice. We found no evidence for methylation-associated silencing of Pten; rather, complex structural abnormalities comprised of missense and nonsense mutations, 1- and 3-bp insertions, and focal deletions were identified in 8 of 23 lymphomas (35%). Sequencing of deletion breakpoints suggested that aberrant V(D)J recombination and microhomology-mediated rearrangement were responsible for the focal deletions. Seven of the 8 lymphomas had biallelic alterations, and 4 of them did not express Pten protein. These Pten aberrations coincided with downstream Akt phosphorylation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Pten inactivation is frequently biallelic and is caused by a variety of structural abnormalities (rather than by epigenetic silencing) and is involved in radiation-induced lymphomagenesis."
Diazepam and rolipram differentially inhibit cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterases PDE4A1 and PDE4B3 in the mouse,"James A Cherry, Barbara E Thompson, Vanee Pho, ","Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Structure and Expression, Volume 1518, Issues 1每2, 19 March 2001, Pages 27-35, ","Cyclic AMP is hydrolyzed by members of at least eight classes of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Although it has been reported that cyclic AMP PDE activity in mammalian tissues can be inhibited by benzodiazepines, it has not been conclusively demonstrated that members of the class of cyclic AMP-specific, rolipram-inhibitable PDEs (PDE4s) are targets for these drugs. Moreover, no PDE4s expressed in mice have been characterized. To address these issues, we isolated two cDNAs representing homologues of PDE4A1 and PDE4B3 from a mouse brain library. After transient transfection in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the mouse PDEs hydrolyzed cyclic AMP with a low Km and were inhibited by rolipram; both are properties typical of other mammalian PDE4 enzymes. In addition, we found that diazepam inhibited cyclic AMP hydrolysis by the mouse PDE4 subtypes. Interestingly, PDE4B was significantly more sensitive to inhibition by both rolipram and diazepam than the PDE4A subtype. This is the first demonstration that recombinantly expressed PDE4s are inhibited by diazepam, and should facilitate future studies with mouse models of depression and anxiety."
Predictive factors for clinical pregnancies of poor responders diagnosed according to the Bologna criteria in ovarian stimulation in vitro fertilization (IVF),"Hui KE, Li-zheng YAN, ","Journal of Reproduction and Contraception, Volume 26, Issue 3, September 2015, Pages 141-145, ","To explore the predictive factors for clinical pregnancies of poor responders diagnosed according to the Bologna criteria in ovarian stimulation in vitro fertilization (IVF).The present study included 392 poor responders diagnosed according to the Bologna criteria (392 first poor response cycles and 247 subsequent conventional stimulation cycles) in our IVF center. Binary Logistic regression analysis was used to study the association between possible predictive factors and clinical pregnancy of poor responders in ovarian stimulation IVF.The significant predictive factors for clinical pregnancies of poor responders in ovarian stimulation IVF were female age, number of embryos transferred and ovarian stimulation protocol. Female age had the best predictive value for clinical pregnancy of poor ovarian responders.Poor responders should be encouraged to attempt further ovarian stimulation IVF treatment as soon as possible because the pregnancy rate decreases with advancing female age. Growth hormone supplementation, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedure or assisted hatching seem not be able to prominently improve the pregnancy outcomes of poor responders diagnosed according to the Bologna criteria in ovarian stimulation IVF."

Williams, ","Annals of Vascular Surgery, Volume 24, Issue 7, October 2010, Pages 921-929, ","Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms with the Endologix Powerlink System has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative to open surgery in patients having an aortic neck diameter of up to 26 mm. We report the mid-term outcomes of an endovascular repair approach wherein the infrarenal bifurcated stent graft was placed at the aortoiliac bifurcation, with concomitant placement of a proximal extension having suprarenal orientation for proximal sealing.Between 2006 and 2008, eight US sites enrolled 44 consecutive eligible patients presenting with abdominal aortic aneurysm in a prospective, single arm pivotal trial approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Each patient received a Powerlink infrarenal bifurcated stent graft through anatomical fixation at the aortoiliac bifurcation and a suprarenal extension to achieve proximal sealing. Analysis of the primary endpoint (proximal type I endoleak) was evaluated using contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans at 30 days, with on-going long-term follow-up for safety and treatment effectiveness.Patients (89% male) presented at a mean age of 70 ㊣ 10 years with mean maximal aneurysm sac diameter of 5.5 cm. Challenging infrarenal aortic neck anatomy was present in 93% of patients. Technical success was 100% over a mean procedure time of 129 minutes. No aneurysm-related deaths, conversions, ruptures, migrations, or type III or IV endoleaks have been observed. The majority of endoleaks (80%) observed to date are type II. Currently, the primary clinical success rate is 93%. Two endovascular secondary procedures have been performed for resolution of type IA or type IB endoleak, and one surgical intervention was performed for resolution of limb occlusion. Significant reduction in sac diameter is observed to up to 2 years.The combination of an anatomically-fixed Powerlink infrarenal bifurcated stent graft and a suprarenal proximal extension safely and effectively excludes aneurysms in eligible patients. Longer term follow-up will determine the durability of these findings."

Motivated by the Gilbert每Schlesinger每Kozinec (GSK) and Mitchell每Dem'yanov每Malozemov (MDM) algorithms, two geometric algorithms, called the parametric 米-GSK(par-米-GSK) and parametric 米-MDM(par-米-MDM) algorithms, are introduced to solve the par-糸-SVM.

Similar to the twin support vector machine (TWSVM) classifier, this THSVM determines two hyperspheres by solving two related support vector machine (SVM)-type problems, each one is smaller than the classical SVM, which makes the THSVM be more efficient than the classical SVM. In addition, the THSVM avoids the matrix inversions in its two dual quadratic programming problems (QPPs) compared with the TWSVM. By considering the characteristics of the dual QPPs of THSVM, an efficient Gilbert＊s algorithm for the THSVM based on the reduced convex hull (RCH) instead of directly optimizing its pair of QPPs is further presented. Computational results on several synthetic as well as benchmark datasets indicate the significant advantages of the THSVM classifier in the computational time and test accuracy."

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, including total variation based projection on convex sets (TV-POCS), dictionary learning, block-matching 3D (BM3D), convolutional denoising autoencoders (CDA) and U-Net based residual convolutional neural network (KAIST-Net), both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed method is not only capable of suppressing noise but also recovering structural details. Furthermore, once the network is trained offline, the processing speed for target low-dose images is much faster than other methods."

Then the HD between the two sequences is calculated to reflect the waveform sinusoidal similarity of the differential current. The proposed criterion can be used to distinguish internal faults, magnetizing inrushes and faults accompanied by CT saturation of the transformer. Simulation and experiment tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed criterion."

We measured myocardial velocities in 51 patients with various stages of diastolic dysfunction and in 27 normal volunteers. The discriminating power of each of the standard Doppler indexes of left ventricular filling, pulmonary venous flow, and myocardial velocities was determined with the use of Spearman rank correlation and analysis of variance F statistics. Early diastolic myocardial velocity (Em ) was higher in normal subjects (16.0 ㊣ 3.8 cm/s) than in patients with either delayed relaxation (n = 15, 7.5 ㊣ 2.2 cm/s), pseudonormal filling (n = 26, 7.6 ㊣ 2.3 cm/s), or restrictive filling (n = 10, 7.4 ㊣ 2.4 cm/s, P <.0001). Em was the best single discriminator between control subjects and patients with diastolic dysfunction (P =.7, F = 64.5). Myocardial velocities assessed by Doppler tissue echocardiography are useful in differentiating patients with normal from those with abnormal diastolic function. Myocardial velocity remains reduced even in those stages of diastolic dysfunction characterized by increased preload compensation. (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 1999;12:609-17.)"
Application of artificial neural networks in design of lithium-ion batteries,"Bin Wu, Sangwoo Han, Kang G. Shin, Wei Lu, ","Journal of Power Sources, Volume 395, 15 August 2018, Pages 128-136, ","Simulation-based battery design encounters the difficulty of high computational cost. This paper presents a systematic approach based on the artificial neural network to reduce the computational burden of battery design by several orders-of-magnitude. Two neural networks are constructed using the finite element simulation results from a thermo-electrochemical model. The first neural network serves as a classifier to predict whether a set of input variables is physically feasible. The second neural network yields specific energy and specific power. Both neural networks are validated using extra finite element simulations out of the training data. With a global sensitivity analysis using the neural network, we quantify the effect of input variables on specific energy and specific power by evaluating large combinations of input variables, which is computationally prohibitive for finite element simulations. Among all parameters, the applied C-rate has the largest influence on specific power, while the electrode thickness and porosity are the dominant factors affecting specific energy. Based on this finding, we generate a design map that fulfills the requirements of both specific energy and specific power. Inparticular, we highlight the value of neural network in handling the non-linear, complex and computationally expensive problem of battery design and optimization.Download high-res image (167KB)Download full-size image"

Exploring the excess mortality due to depressive symptoms in a community-based sample: The role of Alzheimer's Disease,"Elvira Lara, Josep Maria Haro, Ming-Xin Tang, Jennifer Manly, Yaakov Stern, ","Journal of Affective Disorders, Volume 202, 15 September 2016, Pages 163-170, ","Depression has been associated with increased risk of death. However, there is lack of studies exploring such relationship in the context of dementia. Given the high prevalence of both depression and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), investigating their temporal association with mortality is of public health relevance.Longitudinal data from the WHICAP study were analyzed (1958 individuals aged ≡65 years). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Respondents were identified as having AD if they satisfied the criteria of the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer＊s disease. Cox regressions analyses were performed to determine the association between depressive symptoms and risk of all-cause mortality using the overall sample, and by AD status.Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with higher mortality risk after adjusting for all potential covariates in the overall sample (HR=1.22; 95% CI=1.02, 1.46) and in individuals with incident AD (HR=1.88; 95% CI=1.12, 3.18).The CES-D does not measure clinical depression but depressive symptomatology. Since those who were exposed to known risk factors for mortality are likely to die prematurely, our results may have been skewed to the individuals with longer survival.Strategies focusing on prevention and early treatment of depression in the elderly may have a beneficial effect not only on patient quality of life and disability, but may also increase survival in the context of AD."
Social function in boys with cleft lip and palate: Relationship to ventral frontal cortex morphology,"Aaron D. Boes, Vesna Murko, Jessica L. Wood, Douglas R. Langbehn, Peg Nopoulos, ","Behavioural Brain Research, Volume 181, Issue 2, 6 August 2007, Pages 224-231, ","Isolated clefts of the lip and/or palate (ICLP) are developmental craniofacial abnormalities that have consistently been linked to increased social inhibition or shyness. Two explanations have been proposed: (1) psychosocial factors related to differences in facial appearance may lead to low self-concept and subsequent shyness, or (2) abnormal development of brain structures involved in social function, such as the ventral frontal cortex (VFC), may underlie the difference. To investigate these two possibilities this study was designed to evaluate measures of social function in relation to measures of self-concept and VFC morphology. Subjects included 30 boys (age 7每12) with ICLP and a comparison group of 43 boys without cleft in the same age category. Social function and self-concept were assessed using questionnaires with standardized scoring filled out by subjects and one of their parents. The cortical volume and surface area of the VFC, composed of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and straight gyrus (SG), were evaluated using structural magnetic resonance imaging. The ICLP subjects had significantly impaired social function relative to the comparison group. No difference in self-concept was identified. VFC morphology revealed significant differences between groups, particularly decreased volume and surface area in the left SG of the ICLP group. Moreover, abnormal VFC measures were correlated with social dysfunction but measures of self-concept were not. These results are consistent with the possibility that aberrant VFC development may partially underlie social dysfunction in boys with ICLP."

Functional studies on the role of Notch signaling in Hydractinia development,"James M. Gahan, Christine E. Schnitzler, Timothy Q. DuBuc, Liam B. Doonan, Uri Frank, ","Developmental Biology, Volume 428, Issue 1, 1 August 2017, Pages 224-231, ","The function of Notch signaling was previously studied in two cnidarians, Hydra and Nematostella, representing the lineages Hydrozoa and Anthozoa, respectively. Using pharmacological inhibition in Hydra and a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches in Nematostella, it was shown in both animals that Notch is required for tentacle morphogenesis and for late stages of stinging cell maturation. Surprisingly, a role for Notch in neural development, which is well documented in bilaterians, was evident in embryonic Nematostella but not in adult Hydra. Adult neurogenesis in the latter seemed to be unaffected by DAPT, a drug that inhibits Notch signaling. To address this apparent discrepancy, we studied the role of Notch in Hydractinia echinata, an additional hydrozoan, in all life stages. Using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutagenesis, transgenesis, and pharmacological interference we show that Notch is dispensable for Hydractinia normal neurogenesis in all life stages but is required for the maturation of stinging cells and for tentacle morphogenesis. Our results are consistent with a conserved role for Notch in morphogenesis and nematogenesis across Cnidaria, and a lineage-specific loss of Notch dependence in neurogenesis in hydrozoans."

In genetic data consisting of 53,555 cases (20,129 bipolar disorder [BD], 33,426 schizophrenia [SCZ]) and 54,065 controls, we identified 114 genome-wide significant loci implicating synaptic and neuronal pathways shared between disorders. Comparing SCZ to BD (23,585 SCZ, 15,270 BD) identified four genomic regions including one with disorder-independent causal variants and potassium ion response genes as contributing to differences in biology between the disorders. Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses identified several significant correlations within case-only phenotypes including SCZ PRS with psychotic features and age of onset in BD. For the first time, we discover specific loci that distinguish between BD and SCZ and identify polygenic components underlying multiple symptom dimensions.

Three-dimensional reinforcement design method and program realization for prestressed concrete box-girder bridges based on a specific spatial lattice grid model,"Yuan Sun, Dong Xu, Bin Chen, Fang-Yuan Xu, Hong-Ping Zhu, ","Engineering Structures, Volume 175, 15 November 2018, Pages 822-846, ","Reinforcement with prestressed steel tendons to prevent cracking is a major design procedure for most concrete box-girder bridges. They provide acceptable performance even though they do not cover all of the principal stress directions of the structural members because ordinary steel bars also play an important role in resisting external loads. However, with the limitations of current design methods, a plane model is always used as a standard for designers for manual performance of the procedure, but it does not provide sufficient information for the reinforcement of easily overlooked parts from the view of integral three-dimensional effects. Design experiences and detailing requirements must therefore be used extensively, leading to either a waste of materials or a greater likelihood of unexpected damage to members. To address this issue, this study proposes a solution for the reinforcement of prestressed concrete box-girder bridges with a new reinforcement method combined with a specific spatial lattice grid model. The model, which finely differentiates the stress sources of the members and especially emphasizes the in-plane stresses of the top and bottom plates, facilitates the establishment of a stress-based reinforcement method to completely consider the three-dimensional effects of prestressed concrete box-girders and provide the necessary information associated with current bridge codes. The method was implemented as the module of a bridge software with an automatic design function. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated and discussed via numerical examples."

The distribution of transplanted human mesenchymal stem cells in the CNS of young Macaca fascicularis,"Jiamei Li, Hua Zhu, Yunxin Chen, Wei Deng, Chuan Qin, ","Brain Research, Volume 1579, 4 September 2014, Pages 1-9, ","Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies have generated much hope and promise as a potential source of cells for cell-based therapeutic strategies in pediatric degenerative diseases. However, the distribution and migratory routes of MSCs are unknown. Here, real-time PCR and microscopy were used to observe the migration and distribution of labeled human MSCs (hMSCs) transplanted into the striatum of young Macaca fascicularis. Moreover, the differentiation of hMSCs was also detected using immunofluorescence. We found that hMSCs were mainly located near the injection site in the brain and in the anterior brain after 2 weeks. After 4 weeks, the hMSCs had dispersed and could be detected in each brain slice and were more uniformly distributed than after 2 weeks. The hMSCs showed a preference for migration towards blood vessels, which may be one of the migratory routes used by hMSCs. Additionally, hMSCs could be observed to give rise to NeuN- and GFAP-positive cells. Transplanted hMSCs also increased the expression levels of N-cadherin in the host brain tissue, which may be one factor that drives the migration and differentiation of hMSCs after transplantation. These results provide preclinical evidence that MSC-based therapies may represent an efficacious alternative to more conventional treatment regimens for a variety of pediatric neurologic disorders."
Non-thermal plasma reduces periodontitis-induced alveolar bone loss in rats,"Yixin Zhang, Yi Xiong, Peng Xie, Xiaogang Ao, Wenchuan Chen, ","Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Volume 503, Issue 3, 10 September 2018, Pages 2040-2046, ","Periodontitis, a chronic infectious disease induced by microbial biofilm, is one of the most common diseases worldwide. Scaling and root planning (SRP) has always been recognized as the typical treatment. However, the therapeutic efficiency is often limited due to the intraoperative bleeding and the limitations of instruments. Non-thermal atmospheric plasma (NTP) appears to be a potential tool for periodontitis due to its promising biofilm degradation and decontamination effects. In this study, we investigated the role of NTP, as an adjuvant approach for the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis in rats. Herein we showed that SRP or SRP-NTP application attenuated the periodontitis-induced alveolar bone loss, reflected by the increased BV/TV value and the decreased CEJ-AB distance, which might be related to the lower detection rate of periodontal pathogen in SRP and SRP-NTP groups. Besides, SRP-NTP rats showed less bone loss and lower CEJ-AB distance than that of SRP group at 30d post treatment, indicating a more comprehensive and long-lasting effect of SRP-NTP. A remarkable decrease of osteoclast number and lower expression of RANKL was also detected in SRP-NTP rats. In addition, expression of inflammatory-related cytokines such as TNF-汐 and IL-1汕 decreased significantly in SRP-NTP group, while IL-10 level increased substantially. These results together illustrated that a combination of SRP and NTP treatment was an effective way to prevent periodontitis progress, which reduced alveolar bone loss and promoted periodontium restoration in ligature-induced periodontitis rats. In conclusion, non-thermal plasma treatment may be considered as a feasible and effective supplementary approach to control periodontitis."
"Apoptosis related protein 3, an ATRA-upregulated membrane protein arrests the cell cycle at G1/S phase by decreasing the expression of cyclin D1","Fang Yu, Guodong Yang, Zhongliang Zhao, Lin Ji, Zifan Lu, ","Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Volume 358, Issue 4, 13 July 2007, Pages 1041-1046, ","Human Apr3 was first cloned from HL-60 cells treated by ATRA. In this study, we further demonstrated that Apr3 could be obviously upregulated by ATRA in many other ATRA sensitive cells, suggesting a common role of Apr3 in ATRA effects. Indirect immunofluorescence assay indicates that Apr3 is a membrane protein, while its truncated form without the predicted transmembrane and intracellular domain, was likely a secreted one. Furthermore, FACS analysis showed that Apr3 overexpression could cause an obvious G1/S phase arrest which might be induced by dramatic reduction of cyclin D1 expression. Strikingly, the truncated Apr3 antagonized the negative role of Apr3 on cell cycle and cyclin D1. Taken together, our data suggest that Apr3 should play an important role in ATRA signal pathway and the predicted transmembrane and/or the intracellular domain mediates Apr3 membrane localization and is vital for the negative regulation on cell cycle and cyclin D1."

Atomization and surface heat transfer characteristics of cryogen spray cooling with expansion-chambered nozzles,"Xin-Sheng Wang, Bin Chen, Zhi-Fu Zhou, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 121, June 2018, Pages 15-27, ","Cryogen spray cooling (CSC) is commonly applied in laser dermatology to protect the epidermis from thermal damage. Many efforts have attempted to improve the cooling capacity of CSC, among which the use of expansion-chambered nozzles is an effectively simple method with considerable potential. This study examined the influences of the expansion-chambered nozzle structure, including the ratios of inlet nozzle diameter to discharge nozzle diameter and of chamber diameter to discharge nozzle diameter on R134a and R404A spray cooling. Fifteen transparent expansion-chambered nozzles with the expansion chamber aspect ratio of 1.0, chamber diameter to discharge nozzle diameter ratios of 5.0每10.0, and inlet nozzle diameter to discharge nozzle diameter ratios of 0.6每1.4 were tested. The internal flow pattern inside the expansion chamber, external spray pattern, and surface heat transfer characteristics of cryogen spray using different nozzles, including the straight-tube nozzle, were investigated. The structure of the expansion chamber was found to have an important effect on the spray patterns and cooling characteristics. The spray radius obviously decreased when the expansion-chambered nozzles were used, and the spray pattern became narrower as the ratio of chamber diameter to discharge nozzle diameter increased. By contrast, the increase in ratio of two nozzle diameters enlarged the spray radius. Surface temperature and heat flux with different nozzles and cryogens showed a similarity, and correlations of surface temperature and heat flux were proposed. The introduction of expansion-chambered nozzles could effectively improve the spray cooling capacity. The minimum average surface temperature during the fully developed spray period could be reached for both R134a spray and R404A spray by an expansion-chambered nozzle with a chamber diameter to discharge nozzle diameter ratio of roughly 5.0 and an inlet nozzle diameter to discharge nozzle diameter ratio of roughly 0.6."

Thompson, ","Dyes and Pigments, Volume 20, Issue 3, 1992, Pages 211-226, ","Several titanium dioxide pigments in the rutile crystalline form have been doped with Ni, Co, Fe, Pb, Cu, V and Mo ions by co-precipitation in aqueous alkaline solution with titanium (IV) chloride. The photoconductivities in thin poly (vinyl carbazole) films and photodielectric microwave responses of the various transition-metal-doped titanium dioxide pigments have been measured and are discussed in terms of their photoactivities. The results suggest that different dopants affect the photoconductive and photodielectric responses of the titanium dioxide pigments to different extents. Photoconductive responses of the rutile pigments measured electrophotographically are enhanced on doping with the metal ions, and these responses increase with increasing concentration. Using microwave spectroscopy, the initial resonant frequency return loss decreases with a magnitude which is dependent upon the type and concentration of the cation. On steady-state illumination, the half-life of the photodielectric shift of the resonant frequency return loss is reduced, i.e., is more facile after doping, with the same order as that observed electrophotographically. The results are discussed in terms of the dopants occupying interstitial Ti(IV) sites in the crystal lattice and behaving as traps for photogenerated holes, thus reducing the photoactivity of the pigment."

Our results demonstrated that hASMCs and hASCs could attach and adhere to the decellularized OAM scaffold and survive and proliferate for at least 7 days depending on the growth conditions. This indicates adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have the potential to substitute for smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the construction of tissue engineered oesophageal muscle layers.
Flexible data access control in D2D communications,"Zheng Yan, Haomeng Xie, Peng Zhang, Brij B.

It is essential to secure D2D communication data for resisting malicious attacks. However, secure D2D communications among mobile devices have not been well solved. By paying attention to the important role of trust in securing D2D communications, in this paper, we propose a scheme using either a General Trust (GT) level issued by a core network or a Local Trust (LT) level evaluated by a device or both to control D2D communication data access by applying Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE). This scheme realizes secure data communications among mobile devices under the legacy system model of Long-Term Evolution (LTE). Performance analysis and evaluation demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective with regard to security, computation complexity, communication cost, flexibility and scalability."

Modified cross sample entropy and surrogate data analysis method for financial time series,"Yi Yin, Pengjian Shang, ","Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, Volume 433, 1 September 2015, Pages 17-25, ","For researching multiscale behaviors from the angle of entropy, we propose a modified cross sample entropy (MCSE) and combine surrogate data analysis with it in order to compute entropy differences between original dynamics and surrogate series (MCSDiff). MCSDiff is applied to simulated signals to show accuracy and then employed to US and Chinese stock markets. We illustrate the presence of multiscale behavior in the MCSDiff results and reveal that there are synchrony containing in the original financial time series and they have some intrinsic relations, which are destroyed by surrogate data analysis. Furthermore, the multifractal behaviors of cross-correlations between these financial time series are investigated by multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DCCA) method, since multifractal analysis is a multiscale analysis. We explore the multifractal properties of cross-correlation between these US and Chinese markets and show the distinctiveness of NQCI and HSI among the markets in their own region. It can be concluded that the weaker cross-correlation between US markets gives the evidence for the better inner mechanism in the US stock markets than that of Chinese stock markets. To study the multiscale features and properties of financial time series can provide valuable information for understanding the inner mechanism of financial markets."
Complementary peptide to the carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide of gastrin,"James E. McGuigan, Martha Campbell-Thompson, ","Gastroenterology, Volume 103, Issue 3, September 1992, Pages 749-758, ","Codons of noncoding DNA strands for peptides have been found to code for amino acids with hydropathic properties opposite to those of the native peptides. Synthetic peptides, designated as complementary peptides, with amino acid sequences coded by noncoding DNA strands of several peptide hormones have been shown to bind the native peptides. In some instances, antibodies to these complementary peptides have shown agonist or antagonist properties of the native hormones. In this study a peptide was synthesized based on codons complementary to messenger RNA for the carboxyl-terminal gastrin tetrapeptide. This complementary peptide bound radiolabeled human gastrin (G17). Antibodies to the complementary peptide competitively inhibited the binding of 125I-gastrin by canine fundic mucosal membrane preparations. These antibodies also showed gastrin agonist properties in that they stimulated canine gastric mucosal parietal cell [14C]aminopyrine uptake, used as an index of stimulation of gastric acid secretion. Competitive inhibition of 125I-gastrin binding by membrane receptors for gastrin and stimulation of [14C]-aminopyrine uptake by antibodies to the complementary peptide for the gastrin tetrapeptide are consistent with their recognition, binding, and occupancy of gastrin receptors."

Molecular dynamics simulation of cross-linked epoxy resin and its interaction energy with graphene under two typical force fields,"Yingying Sun, Lin Chen, Liu Cui, Yuwen Zhang, Xiaoze Du, ","Computational Materials Science, Volume 143, 15 February 2018, Pages 240-247, ","A model of cross-linked epoxy system composed of bisphenol-A resin, 2,3,6-tetrahydro-3-methylphthalic anhydride curing agent, and 2,4,6-tris(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol accelerator was established and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to calculate the properties of the epoxy and its composites. The results show that the mean square displacement (MSD) and glass transition temperature (Tg) calculated by Dreiding force field are always lower than that by PCFF force field, and the simulation results of Dreiding force field are better consistent with experiments. With the increasing simulation size, total MSD increases while Tg decreases slightly. The simulated systems with DGEBA more than 12 have Tg values similar to experiments. The molecular motion of epoxy system is also influenced by the cross-linking degree, and the presence of uncross-linked particles increases the total MSD. In the graphene/epoxy composites, interaction energy between modified monolayer graphene (MMG) sheets is larger than that between epoxy and graphene, indicating that MMG sheets tend to agglomerate when mixing with epoxy. Functionalization of graphene can reduce interaction energy between MMG sheets and increase that between epoxy resin and graphene, which is beneficial to the dispersion of graphene."

It is based on the argument distribution of the hologram spectrum to locate exactly the position of the carrier frequency of the virtual image. This tilt aberration will be corrected by shifting the filtered hologram spectrum to the coordinate origin of the frequency domain, without knowledge of the focal length of the imaging lens or distances in the setup. Then the subsequent quadratic phase aberration compensation is performed only by adjusting a single parameter. The method is demonstrated by the phase contrast imaging of the cervical carcinoma cells."
Exploring multiple profiles of highly rated learner compositions,"Scott Jarvis, Leslie Grant, Dawn Bikowski, Dana Ferris, ","Journal of Second Language Writing, Volume 12, Issue 4, December 2003, Pages 377-403, ","Recent research has come a long way in describing the linguistic features of large samples of written texts, although a satisfactory description of L2 writing remains problematic. Even when variables such as proficiency, language background, topic, and audience have been controlled, straightforward predictive relationships between linguistic variables and quality ratings have remained elusive, and perhaps they always will. We propose a different approach. Rather than assuming a linear relationship between linguistic features and quality ratings, we explore multiple profiles of highly rated timed compositions and describe how they compare in terms of their lexical, grammatical, and discourse features. To this end, we performed a cluster analysis on two sets of timed compositions to examine their patterns of use of several linguistic features. The purpose of the analysis was to investigate whether multiple profiles (or clusters) would emerge among the highly rated compositions in each data set. This did indeed occur. Within each data set, the profiles of highly rated texts differed significantly. Some profiles exhibited above-average levels for several linguistic features, whereas others showed below-average levels. We interpret the results as confirming that highly rated texts are not at all isometric, even though there do appear to be some identifiable constraints on the ways in which highly rated timed compositions may vary."
Berberine inhibits macrophage M1 polarization via AKT1/SOCS1/NF-百B signaling pathway to protect against DSS-induced colitis,"Yunxin Liu, Xiang Liu, Weiwei Hua, Qingyan Wei, Yubing Zhu, ","International Immunopharmacology, Volume 57, April 2018, Pages 121-131, ","Berberine has been reported to have protective effects in colitis treatment. However, the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that berberine could protect against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice by regulating macrophage polarization. In the colitis mouse model, berberine ameliorated DSS-induced colon shortening and colon tissue injury. Moreover, berberine-treated mice showed significant reduction in the disease activity index (DAI), pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and macrophages infiltration compared with the DSS-treated mice. Notably, berberine significantly reduced the percentage of M1 macrophages. In vitro analysis also confirmed the inhibitory effects of berberine on macrophages M1 polarization in RAW267.4 cells. Further investigation showed that berberine promoted AKT1 expression in mRNA and protein level. Silence of AKT1 abolished the inhibitory effect of berberine on macrophages M1 polarization. The berberine-induced AKT1 expression promoted suppressers of cytokine signaling (SOCS1) activation, which inhibited nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-百B) phosphorylation. In addition, we also found that berberine activated AKT1/SOCS1 signaling pathway but inhibited p65 phosphorylation in macrophages in vivo. Therefore, we concluded that berberine played a regulatory role in macrophages M1 polarization in DSS-induced colitis via AKT1/SOCS1/NF-百B signaling pathway. This unexpected property of berberine may provide a potential explanation for its protective effects in colitis treatment."

Inhibition of endocan attenuates monocrotaline-induced connective tissue disease related pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Haiyan Zhao, Yunxin Xue, Yun Guo, Yue Sun, Xiaofei Wang, ","International Immunopharmacology, Volume 42, January 2017, Pages 115-121, ","Connective tissue disease related pulmonary arterial hypertension (CTD-PAH) is characterized by vascular remodeling, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. Endocan is a novel endothelial dysfunction marker. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of endocan in CTD-PAH. Monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH rats were used as the CTD-PAH model. Short hairpin RNA packed in a lentiviral vector used to inhibit endocan expression was intratracheally instilled in rats prior to the MCT injection. Endocan was found to be increased in the serum and lung of MCT-induced PAH rats. Short hairpin RNA mediated knockdown of endocan significantly decreased right ventricular systolic pressure, attenuated pulmonary remodeling and inflammatory responses in the lung. In the in vitro study, tumor necrosis factor-汐 (TNF-汐) exposure caused increased endocan expression in the primary cultured rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (RPMECs). Endocan knockdown inhibited the permeability increase and adhesion molecules secretion in RPMECs induced by TNF-汐. In addition, TNF-汐 induced MAPK activation was blocked when endocan gene was knocked down. These data demonstrate that endocan may play an important role in the development of CTD-PAH. This study provides novel evidence to better understand the pathogenesis of CTD-PAH, which may be beneficial for the treatment of this disease.Download high-res image (124KB)Download full-size image"

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggested the presence of the grafted peptide at the polymer-air interface in vacuo. Dynamic contact angle analysis showed that, in water, the peptide-grafted polyurethane surfaces were more polar than the underivatized polyurethane indicating enrichment of peptide groups at the surface. The attachment and spreading of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on the underivatized and peptide-grafted polyurethanes was investigated. The GRGDSY- and GRGDVY-grafted substrates supported cell adhesion and spreading even without serum in the culture medium. The GRGDVY-grafted substrate supported a larger number of adherent cells and a higher extent of cell spreading than the GRGDSY-grafted substrate. These RGD-containing peptide-grafted polyurethane copolymers may be useful in providing an easily prepared celladhesive substrate for various biomaterial applications."

Taking into account the real topological relations among the participants and the psychological characteristics of the users, in this paper, a hotspot propagation model based on heterogeneous mean field and evolutionary games is proposed. First, in real social networks, the changes of hotspot＊s trend could lead to the dynamic changes of users＊ willingness to participate in the hot topic. This effect is reflected in the dynamic behaviors among the users. In this work, based on the evolutionary games, a dynamic evolution mechanism for users＊ willingness to participate in hotspot is constructed and dynamically adjusts the infection rate of information dissemination model. Second, in view of the heterogeneity of the real network structure and the complexity of the heterogeneous mean field, graphical evolutionary game is introduced to improve the heterogeneous mean field. Thus, a new dynamics model of information dissemination is constructed based on graphical evolutionary game. Finally, considering the dynamic behavior among the nodes and the heterogeneity of real social networks, we obtain a hotspot propagation model based on dynamic evolution mechanism and improved heterogeneous mean field. To verify the proposed model, we perform simulations over synthetic networks and real network. Experiments show that the model effectively reveal the impact of different driving factors on information dissemination, and predict the trend of information dissemination in social networks."

Voluntary vaccination dilemma with evolving psychological perceptions,"Xue Feng, Bin Wu, Long Wang, ","Journal of Theoretical Biology, Volume 439, 14 February 2018, Pages 65-75, ","Voluntary vaccination is a universal control protocol for infectious diseases. Yet there exists a social dilemma between individual benefits and public health: non-vaccinators free ride via the herd immunity from adequate vaccinators who bear vaccination cost. This is due to the interplay between disease prevalence and individual vaccinating behavior. To complicate matters further, individual vaccinating behavior depends on the perceived vaccination cost rather than the actual one. The perception of vaccination cost is an individual trait, which varies from person to person, and evolves in response to the disease prevalence and vaccination coverage. To explore how evolving perception shapes individual vaccinating behavior and thus the vaccination dynamics, we provide a model combining epidemic dynamics with evolutionary game theory which captures the voluntary vaccination dilemma. In particular, individuals adjust their perception based on the inertia effect in psychology and then update their vaccinating behavior through imitating the behavior of a more successful peer. We find that i) vaccination is acceptable when the expected vaccination cost considering perception and actual vaccination cost is less than the maximum of the expected non-vaccination cost; ii) the evolution of perception is a ※double-edged sword§ for vaccination dynamics: it can improve vaccination coverage when most individuals perceive exaggerated vaccination cost, and it inhibits vaccination coverage in the other cases."

At present, the prevalence, mechanism(s), and clinical significance of exercise-induced cTn release remains incompletely understood. This paper will review the biochemistry, prevalence, potential mechanisms, and management of patients with exercise-induced cTn elevations."

Effect of general anaesthesia on functional outcome in patients with anterior circulation ischaemic stroke having endovascular thrombectomy versus standard care: a meta-analysis of individual patient data,"Bruce C V Campbell, Wim H van Zwam, Mayank Goyal, Bijoy K Menon, HERMES collaborators, ","The Lancet Neurology, Volume 17, Issue 1, January 2018, Pages 47-53, ","General anaesthesia (GA) during endovascular thrombectomy has been associated with worse patient outcomes in observational studies compared with patients treated without GA. We assessed functional outcome in ischaemic stroke patients with large vessel anterior circulation occlusion undergoing endovascular thrombectomy under GA, versus thrombectomy not under GA (with or without sedation) versus standard care (ie, no thrombectomy), stratified by the use of GA versus standard care.For this meta-analysis, patient-level data were pooled from all patients included in randomised trials in PuMed published between Jan 1, 2010, and May 31, 2017, that compared endovascular thrombectomy predominantly done with stent retrievers with standard care in anterior circulation ischaemic stroke patients (HERMES Collaboration). The primary outcome was functional outcome assessed by ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days in the GA and non-GA subgroups of patients treated with endovascular therapy versus those patients treated with standard care, adjusted for baseline prognostic variables. To account for between-trial variance we used mixed-effects modelling with a random effect for trials incorporated in all models. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane method. The meta-analysis was prospectively designed, but not registered.Seven trials were identified by our search; of 1764 patients included in these trials, 871 were allocated to endovascular thrombectomy and 893 were assigned standard care. After exclusion of 74 patients (72 did not undergo the procedure and two had missing data on anaesthetic strategy), 236 (30%) of 797 patients who had endovascular procedures were treated under GA. At baseline, patients receiving GA were younger and had a shorter delay between stroke onset and randomisation but they had similar pre-treatment clinical severity compared with patients who did not have GA. Endovascular thrombectomy improved functional outcome at 3 months both in patients who had GA (adjusted common odds ratio (cOR) 1﹞52, 95% CI 1﹞09每2﹞11, p=0﹞014) and in those who did not have GA (adjusted cOR 2﹞33, 95% CI 1﹞75每3﹞10, p<0﹞0001) versus standard care. However, outcomes were significantly better for patients who did not receive GA versus those who received GA (covariate-adjusted cOR 1﹞53, 95% CI 1﹞14每2﹞04, p=0﹞0044). The risk of bias and variability between studies was assessed to be low.Worse outcomes after endovascular thrombectomy were associated with GA, after adjustment for baseline prognostic variables. These data support avoidance of GA whenever possible. The procedure did, however, remain effective versus standard care in patients treated under GA, indicating that treatment should not be withheld in those who require anaesthesia for medical reasons.Medtronic."
Fusing and mining opinions for reputation generation,"Zheng Yan, Xuyang Jing, Witold Pedrycz, ","Information Fusion, Volume 36, July 2017, Pages 172-184, ","The Internet provides a convenient platform for people to freely share their opinions on any entities. The opinions expressed in natural languages carry the subjective attitudes and preferences of humans. They represent the public perspectives on any entity, thus impact user decisions and behaviors in some way. Therefore, opinions have been recognized as useful and valuable pieces of information for reputation generation. Fusing and mining opinions offer a promising approach to extract reputation information and track public perspectives. However, the literature lacks studies on this topic. In this paper, we propose a novel reputation generation approach based on opinion fusion and mining. In our approach, opinions are filtered to eliminate unrelated ones, and then grouped into a number of fused principal opinion sets that contain opinions with a similar or the same attitude or preference. By aggregating the ratings attached to the fused opinions, we normalize the reputation of an entity. Meanwhile, various types of recommendations can be generated based on relationships among opinions. To offer sufficient reputation information to users, we also propose a new way of reputation visualization. It shows the details of opinion fusing and mining results, such as the normalized reputation value, principal opinions with popularity and other statistics. Experimental results coming from an analysis of big real-world data collected from several popular commercial websites in both English and Chinese demonstrate the generality and accuracy of the proposed approach, especially the effectiveness of opinion filtering for reputation generation. A small-scale real-world user study further quantifies the user acceptance of the developed reputation visualization method. In the sequel, this implies that the proposed approach can be applied in practice to generate reputation."
Molecular dynamics simulation of the effect of oxygen-containing functional groups on the thermal conductivity of reduced graphene oxide,"Yingying Sun, Lin Chen, Liu Cui, Yuwen Zhang, Xiaoze Du, ","Computational Materials Science, Volume 148, 1 June 2018, Pages 176-183, ","Models of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with different numbers of layers and simulation sizes were established and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the influence of oxygen-containing functional groups on the thermal conductivity (TC) of RGO. The results show that the TCs of both monolayer RGO (MRGO) and bilayer RGO (BRGO) increase with the increasing simulation length; under the same simulation size, the TC of BRGO is always lower than that of the MRGO. With the increasing content of functional groups, TCs of both MRGO and BRGO increase firstly and then decline. For MRGO, the optimum content occurs at about 2%. The phonon resonant frequency of MRGO with content of functional groups lower than 2% remains constant, and shifts to a lower frequency when the content of functional groups is higher than 2%; this confirms the effects of functional groups and wrinkling structure with ripples on the phonon scattering. For BRGO, the optimum content occurs at about 1%, which is lower than that for MRGO, since the interlayer distance of BRGO increases linearly with the increasing content of functional groups. Moreover, the changing trends of interaction energy and interlayer thermal resistance of BRGO are consistent with the TC change of BRGO."
Influence of the luminous gas phase on direct current plasma polymerized hydrocarbon film growth,"Chun Huang, Qingsong Yu, Shin-Yi Wu, ","Vacuum, Volume 84, Issue 12, 25 June 2010, Pages 1402-1406, ","The characteristics of the glow created in plasma polymerization systems are notably different from inert gas plasmas such as argon, in which the well-known negative glow is the primary glow. The study of direct current (DC) glow discharges of a series of saturated hydrocarbon monomers indicated that cathode glow forms the distinctive glow in plasma polymerization systems. It forms a strong contrast to characteristic negative ionization glow of glow discharges of inert gases that do not polymerize. Optical emission analysis results obtained from these plasma deposition systems indicated that polymerizable species are mainly formed in cathode glow region. The growth of direct current plasma polymerized hydrocarbon film clearly showed the dominating effects of luminous gas phases on the polymerizable tendency in plasma polymerization system."
Determining analogies based on the integration of multiple information sources,"Emiao Lu, Julia Handl, Dong-ling Xu, ","International Journal of Forecasting, Volume 34, Issue 3, July每September 2018, Pages 507-528, ","Forecasting approaches that exploit analogies require the grouping of analogous time series as the first modeling step; however, there has been limited research regarding the suitability of different segmentation approaches. We argue that an appropriate analytical segmentation stage should integrate and trade off different available information sources. In particular, it should consider the actual time series patterns, in addition to the variables that characterize the drivers behind the patterns observed. The simultaneous consideration of both information sources, without prior assumptions regarding the relative importance of each, leads to a multicriteria formulation of the segmentation stage. Here, we demonstrate the impact of such an adjustment to segmentation on the final forecasting accuracy of the cross-sectional multi-state Kalman filter. In particular, we study the relative merits of single and multicriteria segmentation stages for a simulated data set with a range of noise levels. We find that a multicriteria approach consistently achieves a more reliable recovery of the original clusters, and this feeds forward to an improved forecasting accuracy across short forecasting horizons. We then use a US data set on income tax liabilities to verify that this result generalizes to a real-world setting."

The approximate phase distribution is obtained by a constrained optimization approach from the off-axis hologram, and it is used in an iterative procedure for retrieving the complex field of the object from the Gabor hologram. Furthermore, principal component analysis is introduced for compensating for phase aberrations caused by the medium. Numerical simulations and optical experiments were carried out to validate the proposed method. The quality of the reconstructed image is improved remarkably compared to only off-axis digital holography."
Local scaling heuristic-based regularization for pattern classification,"Xinjun Peng, Dong Xu, ","Neurocomputing, Volume 119, 7 November 2013, Pages 264-272, ","In this paper, a novel regularization method called the local scaling heuristic-based regularization (LSHR) is proposed for binary classification. The idea in LSHR is to integrate the underlying knowledge inside the training points, including the intra-class and inter-class local information in training points. By combining the local scaling heuristic strategy, this LSHR uses two matrices defined on the intra-class and inter-class graphs of points to reflect the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of outputs. Based on the LSHR method, two classifiers with the hinge and least squares loss functions, H-LSHR and LS-LSHR, are presented for binary classification. The experimental results on several artificial, UCI benchmark datasets and USPS digit datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Hepatoprotective effects of berberine on acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in mice,"Zheng Zhao, Qingyan Wei, Weiwei Hua, Yunxin Liu, Yubing Zhu, ","Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, Volume 103, July 2018, Pages 1319-1326, ","Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity remains the leading cause of drug-induced liver injury due to the lack of safe and effective therapeutic agents. Berberine (BBR) is a natural alkaloid derived from traditional medicine Rhizoma Coptidis and possesses various pharmacological properties. The aim of this study was to explore the hepatoprotective effects and underlying mechanisms of BBR on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. Our results indicated that BBR pretreatment significantly ameliorated APAP-induced hepatic pathological abnormalities and attenuated the elevations of serum aminotransferases and liver/body weight ratio. Compared to APAP group, BBR notably increased the levels of hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases, whereas failed to ameliorate APAP-induced GSH depletion. Pretreatment with BBR significantly reduced hepatic MDA and MPO levels, inhibited JNK phosphorylation and up-regulated the expression of nuclear Nrf-2 and its downstream gene Mn-SOD. Additionally, BBR obviously prevented APAP-induced DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, BBR pretreatment dramatically reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, HMGB1, p-p65 and cleaved caspase-1 and inhibited the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. Taken these results together, BBR exhibits notable preventive effects on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibiting oxidative stress, hepatocyte necrosis and inflammatory response.Download high-res image (170KB)Download full-size image"

Speckle suppression in off-axis lensless Fourier transform digital holography,"Spozmai Panezai, Jie Zhao, Yunxin Wang, Dayong Wang, Lu Rong, ","Optics Communications, Volume 397, 15 August 2017, Pages 100-104, ","Speckle noise suppression in off-axis lensless Fourier transform digital holography by laterally shifting of object is analyzed quantitatively. Speckle decorrelation is directly proportional to the object displacement therefore object is shifted by three different amounts to test its effect on the speckle contrast reduction that is pixel size of camera, averaged speckle size and resolution pixel size of reconstruction plane. Phase-only spatial light modulator (LCOS) is used in object beam path to introduce the lateral shift in its position digitally without mechanical efforts by displaying a grating function. In comparison with the typical methods, the externally input lateral position shifts of object are controlled accurately, which makes the system effective and practicable. Averaged reconstructed results for three quantitative object lateral position shifts are compared and it has been found that the object shift by resolution pixel size of reconstruction plane shows better speckle contrast reduction and is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction."

The most common primary sources of deep neck infection are odontogenic, tonsillar, salivary gland, foreign body, and malignancy. Microbiology typically reveals mixed bacterial flora, including anaerobic species, that can rapidly progress to a fulminating necrotizing fasciitis. The treatment cornerstone remains securing the airway, providing efficient drainage and appropriate antibiotics, and improving immunologic status. A prolonged hospital stay should be anticipated."

Channeled spectrum in the transmission of phononic crystal waveguides,"Yan-Feng Wang, Ting-Ting Wang, Jun-Wei Liang, Yue-Sheng Wang, Vincent Laude, ","Journal of Sound and Vibration, In press, accepted manuscript, Available online 13 September 2018, ","Waveguiding in a phononic crystal (PC) can be achieved along either linear line defects or a sequence of cavities, for frequencies belonging to a complete bandgap. When waves are coupled inside a PC waveguide, modulations in the frequency transmission are generally observed, leading to the formation of a channeled spectrum. We show that the channeled spectrum results from the interference of forward and backward guided Bloch waves. We first theoretically develop a Bloch wave interference model. Then, we consider the case of linear waveguides and of coupled-resonator waveguides formed in a 2D square PC composed of water cylinders in mercury. The transmission properties of waveguides with different length and defect distribution are examined. In all cases, the observed channeled spectra are well explained by the theoretical model. This work is relevant to the design of new acoustic and elastic wave devices."

Survival analysis of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients receiving patient-controlled epidural analgesia,"Shang-Yi Lee, Chih-Jen Hung, Chih-Chieh Chen, Chih-Cheng Wu, ","Journal of the Chinese Medical Association, Volume 77, Issue 11, November 2014, Pages 589-593, ","Postoperative nausea and vomiting as well as postoperative pain are two major concerns when patients undergo surgery and receive anesthetics. Various models and predictive methods have been developed to investigate the risk factors of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and different types of preventive managements have subsequently been developed. However, there continues to be a wide variation in the previously reported incidence rates of postoperative nausea and vomiting. This may have occurred because patients were assessed at different time points, coupled with the overall limitation of the statistical methods used. However, using survival analysis with Cox regression, and thus factoring in these time effects, may solve this statistical limitation and reveal risk factors related to the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in the following period.In this retrospective, observational, uni-institutional study, we analyzed the results of 229 patients who received patient-controlled epidural analgesia following surgery from June 2007 to December 2007. We investigated the risk factors for the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and also assessed the effect of evaluating patients at different time points using the Cox proportional hazards model. Furthermore, the results of this inquiry were compared with those results using logistic regression.The overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in our study was 35.4%. Using logistic regression, we found that only sex, but not the total doses and the average dose of opioids, had significant effects on the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting at some time points. Cox regression showed that, when patients consumed a higher average dose of opioids, this correlated with a higher incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting with a hazard ratio of 1.286.Survival analysis using Cox regression showed that the average consumption of opioids played an important role in postoperative nausea and vomiting, a result not found by logistic regression. Therefore, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients cannot be reliably determined on the basis of a single visit at one point in time."

As an intermediary between power grid and individual electric vehicle, electric vehicle aggregator can play an important role in the coordination and management of electric vehicle charging. In this paper, we develop a decentralized EV charging control strategy of the electric vehicle aggregator for scheduling the flexible charging demand of plug-in electric vehicles in residential distribution networks. First, the centralized charging control model of the electric vehicle aggregator aiming at the maximization of its revenue under the background of time of use price mechanism is established, meanwhile meeting individual charging requirements and satisfying distribution network constraints. Then a decentralized charging control strategy of the electric vehicle aggregator based on the augmented Lagrangian method and the alternating direction multiplier method is proposed. The electric vehicles can decide their charging plan locally with the decentralized strategy, which can eliminate the problem of high communication cost, low computing efficiency and privacy protection caused by the centralized charging control model in practical application. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is evaluated with a representative distribution network model."
Privacy-preserving trust management for unwanted traffic control,"Lifang Zhang, Zheng Yan, Raimo Kantola, ","Future Generation Computer Systems, Volume 72, July 2017, Pages 305-318, ","The pervasive use of the Internet has caused an incredible growth of unwanted traffic, such as spam, malware and malicious intrusions. Controlling unwanted traffic based on trust and reputation mechanisms has invited significant and rigorous research in recent years. However, few of existing solutions concern and preserve the privacy of Internet hosts that report suspicious attacks. They cannot fulfill legal requirements, and are therefore impractical. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving trust management system for unwanted traffic control by applying homomorphic cryptosystem. The proposed system protects privacy, which is proved to be one-way and semantically secure against chosen-plaintext (IND-CPA) attacks if Computational Composite Residuosity Assumption (CCRA) holds. The system is implemented and its performance is extensively examined in terms of computation complexity, communication overhead and storage consumption. The result shows the effectiveness and practicality of our system to preserve the privacy of Internet hosts in the detection and control of unwanted traffic."

A special biofuel (methyl decanoate, methyl 9-decenoate, and n-heptane) oxidation with 118 species reduced/skeletal mechanism and 837 reactions is combusted instead of methane. The biofuel was fed in the main jet inlet of the well-known Sandia flame D (SFD) while the hot pilot jet is still responsible for ignition. The open-source software OpenFOAM was used for simulating turbulent biofuel-air combustion. To check the accuracy of computational results, the system was initially validated with SFD experimental results and good agreements were found. After ignition, mean temperature distribution and species mean mass fraction at different distances in axial and radial directions were investigated. Results showed that the biofuel can be effectively used as an alternative to SFD not only for generating a reasonable temperature as methane does, but also for significantly reduction in principal greenhouse gas emissions.Download high-res image (306KB)Download full-size image"

Self-calibration of multi-camera networks without feature correspondence between different cameras,"Qian Sun, Dong Xu, ","Optik - International Journal for Light and Electron Optics, Volume 125, Issue 13, July 2014, Pages 3331-3336, ","An automatic calibration approach for multi-camera networks is proposed to calibrate the intrinsic parameters of each camera and the extrinsic parameters between different cameras.

Thirdly, we estimate the extrinsic parameters between different cameras from the rotation and the motion of each camera with respect to the object. Our method only needs to track the motion of objects in each camera without the correspondence between different cameras. It avoids the difficulty of the correspondence between different cameras in real networks.

First, we independently derive the retailer's optimal ordering policy and retail pricing policy for two products and identify the dynamic inconsistency phenomenon in the retailer's optimal retail pricing policies. Second, we analyze the effect of product substitution and revenue sharing coefficients on the retailer's decisions. Through a comparative analysis of two scenarios (i.e., independent and integral decision making for the two products), we quantify the difference in the retailer's optimal decisions. In addition, we find that a larger substitution rate results in a larger retail price difference between two products. Third, we provide the manufacturers' optimal decisions under a Nash equilibrium and show that revenue sharing contracts can achieve supply chain coordination and Pareto improvement."

Atherothrombotic risk factor clustering in healthy male relatives of male patients with intermittent claudication,"Duncan J. Parry, Peter J. Grant, D. Julian A. Scott, ","Journal of Vascular Surgery, Volume 40, Issue 5, November 2004, Pages 891-898, ","Family history is an independent risk factor for premature acute myocardial infarction; in contrast, familial risk for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has yet to be determined. Elevated levels of hemostatic proteins are consistently predictive for cardiovascular risk in ※healthy§ subjects, and may cluster with underlying insulin resistance. Atherothrombotic risk factor clustering occurs in first-degree relatives of subjects with coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. These may contribute to the enhanced cardiovascular risk in these subjects, and we hypothesised that familial clustering may occur in PAD. The objective of this study was to measure atherothrombotic risk factors in healthy male first-degree relatives of men with intermittent claudication, with emphasis on thrombotic risk.One hundred sixty-five healthy male first-degree relatives were compared with control subjects matched for age, sex, and race (n = 165), free from a personal or family history of premature cardiovascular disease. Primary outcome measures were fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, factor VII clotting activity (FVII:C), and factor XIII levels. Atherosclerotic risk factors were measured, and subjects were genotyped for common functional polymorphisms (factor VII r353q and fibrinogen B 汕-455).Relatives had higher mean levels of fibrinogen (3.04 vs 2.89 g/L; P = .021), FVII:C (117% vs 104%; P = .000), factor XIII B subunit (1.11 vs 1.01 IU/mL; P = .000), and complex (A2B2; 1.18 vs 1.11 IU/mL; P = .021). At multivariate analysis the association between relative status and fibrinogen, FVII:C, and factor XIII B subunit levels were independent of other variables.The healthy male relatives of men with PAD have elevated levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, and factor XIII. Our results support the existence of thrombotic risk factor clustering in this population at ※high risk.§"
Robust segmentation of noisy images using a neural network model,"Wang Tao, Zhuang Xinhua, Xing Xiaoliang, ","Image and Vision Computing, Volume 10, Issue 4, May 1992, Pages 233-240, ","In this paper we present a robust algorithm for segmentation of noisy images using a neural network. A neural network model is employed to represent a segmented image in such a way that the region type of each pixel simply corresponds to the neuron state. The image segmentation procedure consists of two phases: initial segmentation, and refining segmentation. The initial segmentation is implemented iteratively by using a dynamic evolution algorithm to minimize the energy function of the neural network. During the second phase, a learning procedure is described to determine the interconnection weights based on a multi-layer logic neural network, and the refining segmentation is achieved by a retrieval procedure. Several experimental results involving both synthetic and real images are reported."
Thermalization of mini-jets in a quark每gluon plasma,"Edmond Iancu, Bin Wu, ","Nuclear Physics A, Volume 956, December 2016, Pages 581-584, ","We present the complete physical picture for the evolution of a high-energy jet propagating through a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by analytical and numerical investigation of thermalization of the soft components of the jet. Our results support the following physical picture: the leading particle emits a significant number of mini-jets which promptly evolve via multiple branching and thus degrade into a myriad of soft gluons, with energies of the order of the medium temperature T. Via elastic collisions with the medium constituents, these soft gluons relax to local thermal equilibrium with the plasma over a time scale which is considerably shorter than the typical lifetime of the mini-jet. The thermalized gluons form a tail which lags behind the hard components of the jet. Together with the background QGP, they behave hydrodynamically."
Tunable band gaps and transmission behavior of SH waves with oblique incident angle in periodic dielectric elastomer laminates,"Jun Zhu, Haoyun Chen, Bin Wu, Weiqiu Chen, Oluwaseyi Balogun, ","International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, Volumes 146每147, October 2018, Pages 81-90, ","This work focuses on understanding elastic wave propagation in the periodic dielectric elastomer (DE) laminates with geometry and material properties that can be tuned by an external electric field.

Numerical calculations of the dispersion relations and transmission properties are presented. The numerical results show that the SH wave band gaps and transmission coefficient depend on various parameters that can be controlled by the applied external electrostatic field and the incident angle of the SH wave, thus providing a novel strategy for designing flexible phononic structures with tunable properties.Download high-res image (116KB)Download full-size image"

Investigating dependencies among oil price and tanker market variables by copula-based multivariate models,"Yi Zhang, ","Energy, Volume 161, 15 October 2018, Pages 435-446, ","Crude oil price, bunker price, and tanker freight rate are very volatile in recent years. Uncertainties about the complicated relationships among these market variables could impose substantial business risks on investors, shipowners, ship operators, and charterers in oil transportation by tankers. A better understanding of the dependencies among these variables can help improve investment and operational decisions. This study aims to develop copula-based multivariate models for analyzing oil price and tanker market variables, and associated efficient approaches to reveal the time varying effects for the relationships. Given the volatilities in oil prices over the recent years, this study analyzes the impact that the changes in oil price has on bunker price and tanker freight rates. The West Texas Intermediate, Bloomberg Weighted Average Bunker Fuel Price, Baltic Handysize Index, Baltic Supramax Index and Baltic Panamax Index are analyzed using various selected copula models, from 2008 through 2015. Findings reveal that high oil price is a factor causing a weak dependence among the studied variables in the tanker market. The use of copula has more advantages over the conventional methods and can best characterize the relationships for the tanker market variables. The time varying effects in the dependences can be well identified in the copula modeling. The results could provide valuable information for the policy makers and participants in the maritime industry. The understanding of the dynamic relationships among the oil market could help the participants to foresee the potential risks and the policy makers to organize a more efficient market."

A Symbolic Decision Procedure for Symbolic Alternating Finite Automata,"Loris D'Antoni, Zachary Kincaid, Fang Wang, ","Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, Volume 336, 16 April 2018, Pages 79-99, ","We introduce Symbolic Alternating Finite Automata (s-AFA) as a succinct and decidable model for describing sets of finite sequences over arbitrary alphabets. Boolean operations over s-AFAs have linear complexity, which contrasts the quadratic cost of intersection and union for non-alternating symbolic automata. Due to this succinctness, emptiness and equivalence checking are PSpace-hard. We introduce an algorithm for checking the equivalence of two s-AFAs based on bisimulation up to congruence. This algorithm exploits the power of SAT solvers to efficiently search the state space of the s-AFAs. We evaluate our decision procedure on two verification and security applications: 1) checking satisfiability of linear temporal logic formulae over finite traces, and 2) checking equivalence of Boolean combinations of regular expressions. Our experiments show that our technique can be beneficial in both applications."

General memristor with applications in multilayer neural networks,"Shiping Wen, Xudong Xie, Zheng Yan, Tingwen Huang, Zhigang Zeng, ","Neural Networks, Volume 103, July 2018, Pages 142-149, ","Memristor describes the relationship between charge and flux. Although several window functions for memristors based on the HP linear and nonlinear dopant drift models have been studied, most of them are inadequate to capture the full characteristics of memristors. To address this issue, this paper proposes a unified window function to describe a general memristor with restrictions of its parameters given. Compared with other window functions, the proposed function demonstrates high validity and accuracy. In order to make the simulation results have high consistency with the results of actual circuit, we apply the new window function to the simulation of a memristor-based multilayer neural network (MNN) circuit. The overall accuracy will vary with the change of control parameters in the window function. It implies that the proposed model can guide the design of actual memristor-based circuits."
Encrypted data processing with Homomorphic Re-Encryption,"Wenxiu Ding, Zheng Yan, Robert H. Deng, ","Information Sciences, Volumes 409每410, October 2017, Pages 35-55, ","Cloud computing offers various services to users by re-arranging storage and computing resources. In order to preserve data privacy, cloud users may choose to upload encrypted data rather than raw data to the cloud. However, processing and analyzing encrypted data are challenging problems, which have received increasing attention in recent years. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) was proposed to support computation on encrypted data and ensure data confidentiality simultaneously. However, a limitation of HE is it is a single user system, which means it only allows the party that owns a homomorphic decryption key to decrypt processed ciphertexts. Original HE cannot support multiple users to access the processed ciphertexts flexibly. In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Data Processing (PPDP) system with the support of a Homomorphic Re-Encryption Scheme (HRES). The HRES extends partial HE from a single-user system to a multi-user one by offering ciphertext re-encryption to allow multiple users to access processed ciphertexts. Through the cooperation of a Data Service Provider (DSP) and an Access Control Server (ACS), the PPDP system can support seven basic operations over ciphertexts, which include Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Sign Acquisition, Comparison, Equivalent Test, and Variance. To enhance the flexibility and security of our system, we further apply multiple ACSs to take in charge of the data from their own users and design computing operations over ciphertexts belonging to multiple ACSs. We then prove the security of PPDP, analyze its performance and advantages by comparing with some latest work, and demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness through simulations with regard to big data process."
On the mechanisms of the saltating motion of bedload,"Youhua Chen, Yuchuan Bai, Dong Xu, ","International Journal of Sediment Research, Volume 32, Issue 1, March 2017, Pages 53-59, ","Saltation of sediment particles is an important pattern of bedload transport.

Simulation results on the saltating trajectories neglecting particle rotation and turbulence effects compare fairly well with experimental observations. The mean values of the saltation parameters (saltation height, length and velocity) also agree well with the previous experimental data. Based on the numerical results, regression equations for the dimensionless saltation height, length and velocity were presented. Using the numerically achieved characteristics of the sediment saltation, we also obtained mathematical expression for the sediment transport rate. The studies in this paper are significant for its contribution to mechanism of the bedload motion and the computation of sediment transport rate."

However, it only simply considers the prior class-based structural information in the optimization problems. In this paper, a structural regularized PTSVM (SRPTSVM) classifier for binary classification is presented. This proposed SRPTSVM focuses on the cluster-based structural information of the corresponding class in each optimization problem, which is vital for designing a good classifier in different real-world problems. This SRPTSVM is extended to a nonlinear version by the kernel trick. Experimental results demonstrate that SRPTSVM is superior in generalization performance to other classifiers."
An energy-constrained signal subspace method for speech enhancement and recognition in white and colored noises,"Jun Huang, Yunxin Zhao, ","Speech Communication, Volume 26, Issue 3, November 1998, Pages 165-181, ","In this paper, an energy-constrained signal subspace (ECSS) method is proposed for speech enhancement and automatic speech recognition under additive noise condition. The key idea is to match the short-time energy of the enhanced speech signal to the unbiased estimate of the short-time energy of the clean speech, which is proven very effective for improving the estimation of the noise-like, low-energy segments in continuous speech. The ECSS method is applied to both white and colored noises where the additive colored noise is modelled by an autoregressive (AR) process. A modified covariance method is used to estimate the AR parameters of the colored noise and a prewhitening filter is constructed based on the estimated parameters. The performances of the proposed algorithms were evaluated using the TI46 digit database and the TIMIT continuous speech database. It was found that the ECSS method can achieve very high word recognition accuracy (WRA) for the digits set under low SNR conditions. For continuous speech data set, this method helped to improve the SNR by 2每6 dB and the WRA by 13.7每45.5% for the white noise and 18.6每55.9% for the colored noise under various SNR conditions."

Experiments were performed on the WSJ1 task with American English speech, British accented speech, and mandarin Chinese accented speech. Results show that the use of prior knowledge of accents enabled more reliable estimation of bias distributions with very small amounts of adaptation speech, or without adaptation speech. Recognition results show that the new approach is superior to the previous maximum expected likelihood (MEL) method, especially when adaptation data are very limited."

Historically, these patterns include impaired attention in the context of normal memory, extremely poor recognition memory following minor injury and at a level inconsistent with that seen in severe traumatic brain injury, and impaired immediate memory in the context of preserved verbal intellectual functions. Although invalid performance can be present in any type of psychological or neuropsychological evaluation, it is particularly important in high stakes assessments (e.g., forensic, medical每legal) where having a specific diagnosis, high levels of symptoms, or demonstrated impairment is advantageous. When negative response bias is present, the test results are not an accurate reflection of the person＊s cognitive functioning.

This paper describes requirements and design principles of an electric motor drive and variable pitch tail rotor system. A particular spoke-type architecture of the motor is designed, and the performance of blades is analyzed by the CFD method. The demand for simplicity of moving parts and strict constraints on the weight of a helicopter makes the design of electrical and mechanical components challenging. Different solutions have been investigated to propose an effective alternative to the mechanical actuation system. A test platform is constructed which can collect the dynamic response of the thrust control. The enhancement of the response speed due to an individual motor speed control and variable-pitch system is validated."

The true image is modeled by a discrete Markov random field (MRF), and the noise is a flip error that changes the gray levels of an image with transition probabilities. A parameter estimation algorithm is developed for the model based on the reestimation formulation in HMM.3 At each iteration of the reestimation, the Gibbs distribution (MRF) parameters are estimated using the gradient ascent, and the noise parameter is estimated as the percentage of pixels in the true image having the same gray levels as the observed image, where the percentage is a posterior expectation over all possible configurations of the true image. The parameter estimation algorithm falls into the paradigm of the generalized expectation-maximization technique. The parameter estimate converges to a maximum likelihood estimate under lenient conditions. The Gibbs samplers are used to generate the samples of MRFs and sample averages are taken to approximate the expectation terms used in parameter estimation. Images are restored using the minimum misclassification technique. Experiments on binary images contaminated by 20每30% noise showed good restoration results."

A Weighted Semi-Distributed Routing Algorithm for LEO satellite networks,"Zhe Guo, Zheng Yan, ","Journal of Network and Computer Applications, Volume 58, December 2015, Pages 1-11, ","Satellites play a major role in the development of a global information infrastructure. Developing a specialized, efficient and robust routing algorithm in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks is a challenge in both research and practice. For example, algorithms based on topology can find the shortest path but the complexity of time and space is high; some algorithms based on Datagram Routing Algorithm (DRA) have a high computation overhead; others based on Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) store all route information in datagram, which however negatively impacts routing efficiency and robustness. In this paper, we propose a Weighted Semi-Distributed Routing Algorithm (WSDRA) that discovers a path with minimum propagation delay by using delicate information of two routing hops. This design can reduce computation overhead up to 50% compared to DRA. Low-cost ground networks are also embraced in WSDRA by applying a weighed cost function to describe path cost. In particular, we design a new antenna structure to cross Counter-Rotating Seam in order to shorten a routing path. We evaluate the propagation delay through both simulations and practical tests. The results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient and robust than DRA and the delay can be reduced about 50% after adopting the new antenna structure."

On the basis of this, the qualitative and quantitative relationships between the development of material damage and the deterioration of component performance were analyzed. It realizes the cross-scale conversion of damage information about structural components of RC shear wall from the local material scale to the component scale. Then the cross-scale refinement model of damage evolution of RC shear walls in the whole process was established, simplified and verified. The results show that, the refinement model can explain the development and distribution of damage evolution of RC shear walls in the whole process quickly and easily. The research results can provide a reference for the refinement of seismic design, damage assessment and reinforcement of RC shear walls."
Effects of Social Ties on Self-rated Physical Health Among African American Adults,"Jan Warren-Findlow, James N. Laditka, Michael E. Thompson, Sarah B. Laditka, ","Journal of the National Medical Association, Volume 105, Issue 1, Spring 2013, Pages 23-32, ","To examine associations between social ties and self-rated physical health among midlife and older African Americans.Cross-sectional analysis of the 2005-2006 Milwaukee African American oversample of the second Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS II) study. Multivariate logistic regression examined associations between type of social ties (family or friends), their frequency (number of contacts), and their quality (support and strain) with better self-rated physical health (SRPH). We defined better SRPH to include self-reports of good, very good, or excellent SRPH; this category was compared with fair or poor SRPH. Control variables included demographic factors; social engagement characteristics such as working, volunteering, and caregiving; and measures of social structure such as types of discrimination experience and ratings of neighborhood quality.In adjusted results, each additional degree of family support was associated with better self-rated physical health (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.22). Each additional reported incident of daily discrimination was associated with 9% lower odds of reporting better SRPH (OR, 0.91; CI, 0.83-0.99).Results suggest quality of family support may contribute importantly to the health of African Americans. When working with midlife and older African Americans, providers should engage and support families as a vital resource to improve health."

Temperature uniformity of a heated lithium-ion battery cell in cold climate,"Zhiguo Lei, Yuwen Zhang, Xueguo Lei, ","Applied Thermal Engineering, Volume 129, 25 January 2018, Pages 148-154, ","At low temperatures, charge每discharge performances of lithium-ion batteries decline rapidly. Preheat is essential for an effective battery thermal management system. Temperature uniformities of lithium-ion battery cells heated by the self-heating lithium-ion battery structure (SHLB) method and the wide-line metal film (WLMF) method are studied by the transient three-dimensional heating finite element models. Under the same condition, the temperature of a lithium-ion battery cell heated by SHLB heating method is three times more uniform than that heated by the WLMF heating method. However, temperature uniformity of a lithium-ion battery cell heated by SHLB method still is poor. Effects of environment temperature, heating time, heating power, thickness of a lithium-ion battery cell and stand time after heating on temperature distribution of a lithium-ion battery cell heated have been analyzed. For the two heating methods, heating power, thickness of a lithium-ion battery cell and stand time after heating have remarkably influences on temperature distribution of a heated lithium-ion battery cell. For SHLB heating method, temperature uniformity of a heated lithium-ion battery cell is acceptable by decreasing heating power and thickness of a lithium-ion battery cell if there is no safety issue on the structure. Meanwhile, for WLMF heating method, temperature uniformity of a heated lithium-ion battery cell is also acceptable by decreasing heating power, thickness of a lithium-ion battery cell or increasing stand time after heating."
A fast and memory-efficient N-gram language model lookup method for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition,"Xiaolong Li, Yunxin Zhao, ","Computer Speech & Language, Volume 21, Issue 1, January 2007, Pages 1-25, ","Recently, minimum perfect hashing (MPH)-based language model (LM) lookup methods have been proposed for fast access of N-gram LM scores in lexical-tree based LVCSR (large vocabulary continuous speech recognition) decoding. Methods of node-based LM cache and LM context pre-computing (LMCP) have also been proposed to combine with MPH for further reduction of LM lookup time. Although these methods are effective, LM lookup still takes a large share of overall decoding time when trigram LM lookahead (LMLA) is used for lower word error rate than unigram or bigram LMLAs. Besides computation time, memory cost is also an important performance aspect of decoding systems. Most speedup methods for LM lookup obtain higher speed at the cost of increased memory demand, which makes system performance unpredictable when running on computers with smaller memory capacities. In this paper, an order-preserving LM context pre-computing (OPCP) method is proposed to achieve both fast speed and small memory cost in LM lookup. By reducing hashing operations through order-preserving access of LM scores, OPCP cuts down LM lookup time effectively. In the meantime, OPCP significantly reduces memory cost because of reduced size of hashing keys and the need for only last word index of each N-gram in LM storage. Experimental results are reported on two LVCSR tasks (Wall Street Journal 20K and Switchboard 33K) with three sizes of trigram LMs (small, medium, large). In comparison with above-mentioned existing methods, OPCP reduced LM lookup time from about 30每80% of total decoding time to about 8每14%, without any increase of word error rate. Except for the small LM, the total memory cost of OPCP for LM lookup and storage was about the same or less than the original N-gram LM storage, much less than the compared methods. The time and memory savings in LM lookup by using OPCP became more pronounced with the increase of LM size."

All the trials conclude SLNB has survival rates comparable to those of ALND (up to 10 years in one study) and conclude SLNB has less morbidity than ALND. All the trials support replacing ALND with SLNB for staging in early breast cancer; all support SLNB as the standard of care for such cancer. The SLNB protocols used in the trials varied, and no consensus that would suggest a standard protocol exists. The results of the trials and of other peer-reviewed research do, however, suggest a framework for including some specific methodologies in accepted practice. This article highlights the overall survival and disease-free survival data as reported from the clinical trials. This article also reviews the status of SLN procedures and the following: male breast cancer, the roles of various imaging modalities (single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and ultrasound), ductal carcinoma in situ, extra-axillary SLNs, SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation exposure to patients and medical personnel, and a new radiotracer that is the first to label SLNs not by particle trapping but by specific macrophage receptor binding.

Rate每distortion model based rate control for real-time VBR video coding and low-delay communications,"Junfeng Bai, Qingmin Liao, Xinggang Lin, Xinhua Zhuang, ","Signal Processing: Image Communication, Volume 17, Issue 2, February 2002, Pages 187-199, ","Rate control is an important component in a video encoder for data storage or real-time visual communications. In the paper, we will discuss the rate control in MPEG encoder for low-delay real-time video communications over variable bit-rate (VBR) channel. In low-delay video communications, the video transmission is subject not only to the channel rate constraints, but also to the end-to-end delay constraints. In the paper, we employ leaky-bucket model to describe the traffic parameters and monitor the encoder's output. First, an ad hoc bit-allocation method is introduced. Although satisfying the rate constraints perfectly, it provides the objective quality of the decoded image to be just comparable to that of CBR rate control using MPEG2 TM5. Then, a new rate每distortion model is developed, based on which an advanced rate control algorithm is designed, producing almost uniform distortion within a frame as well as consistent video quality between frames. Experimental results show that, when compared to both the MPEG2 TM5 and the proposed ad hoc bit-allocation method, the advanced rate control algorithm maintains not only a constant buffer delay, but also a stable decoded image quality in the scenario of VBR transmission."

This approach lets unscented Kalman filter act on each particle of particle filter algorithm, which makes particle mix the latest posterior information of measurement when updating. It solves the depletion problem of particles to some extent and improves the effectiveness of filtering method.

A neural net algorithm for multidimensional maximum entropy spectrum estimation,"Xinhua Zhuang, Yunxin Zhao, Thomas S. Huang, ","Neural Networks, Volume 4, Issue 5, 1991, Pages 619-626, ","As well known, the maximum entropy (ME) method of spectrum estimation has been shown to provide excellent spectral resolution for both one-dimensional (1D) and multidimensional (mD) signals of short data record length. The maximum entropy spectrum is defined as a solution to a constrained optimization problem, where the constraint being the ※correlation-matching§ property. The computation of the 1D ME spectrum is efficient because it can be obtained from the linear equations of autoregressive (AR) signal modeling. In the mD case, however, the computation of the ME spectrum appears to require the use of nonlinear optimization techniques. The optimization problem has been attacked by many researchers from the point of views of both the primal problem and the dual problem, where the dual problem has the advantages of being finite dimensional and thus attracts most of the efforts.In this paper, we present a neural net algorithm to solve the general mD ME spectral estimation. The problem is formulated as a primal constrained optimization problem and is reduced to solve a well-defined initial value problem of differential equations of Lyapunov type. This initial value problem comprises the basis of our neural net algorithm. Experiments on simulated data showed convincingly that the algorithm did provide mD spectral estimates with high resolution and correlation matching property as well as computation efficiency. The authors believe that the proposed mD spectral estimator will find a broad scope of applications where the high-resolution spectrum is of importance."

The radio-frequency ethane plasma polymerization in a closed reactor system was studied. The composition of reactive species in the luminous gas phase was monitored during the deposition process by optical emission spectroscopy. Optical emission analysis indicates that polymerizable species are mainly formed in the glow region. It was found that, in such a closed plasma system, the deposition of ethane plasma polymers could be visualized as the batch processes. In the early stage of radio-frequency plasma initiation, the deposition of plasma polymers was dominated by the hydrocarbon-based species because the hydrocarbon-based species polymerized much quicker than hydrogen-based species. In the final stage, because of the exhaustion of all polymerizable species in the system, the deposition terminated and the deposited plasma polymer surface was endlessly treated by nonpolymer forming gas plasma. The growth of radio frequency plasma polymerized hydrocarbon film clearly showed the dominating effects of luminous gas phases on the polymerizable tendency in plasma polymerization system."

Volkman, ","Journal of Marine Systems, Volume 81, Issues 1每2, April 2010, Pages 134-147, ","A 3D biogeochemical model is validated against regional observations and used to quantify the fluxes and transformations of natural and anthropogenic nutrients in an oligotrophic marine channel and micro-tidal estuary in southern Tasmania. The model reproduces the seasonal cycle of pelagic phytoplankton biomass and dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations observed in 2002 and is not excessively sensitive to the parameterization of the key biogeochemical processes of phytoplankton light absorption, zooplankton grazing or denitrification. Simulations indicate that in 2002, 66% of total nitrogen influx to the region was supplied from marine sources, 20% from rivers and 14% from salmon farms operating in the region. Fish farm loads of labile dissolved and particulate nitrogen have greatest impact on water quality in summer and autumn when they supply labile nutrient to seasonally depleted surface waters and fuel additional phytoplankton growth. Bays in the northern part of the region are more vulnerable to farm nutrient enrichment due, in part, to the residual northward circulation. It is estimated that in 2002 12% of the region had changed from oligotrophic to mesotrophic status due to salmon farm nutrient enrichment. Analysis of a future scenario simulation with 3 fold increase in farm loads quantified the spatial and temporal impact of farms on water quality and indicated that mesotrophic conditions could extend to 54% of the region. Statistical summaries and visualisation methods were used to communicate model results to stakeholders. Management action has been taken to limit future fish farm loads into the region and implement an environmental monitoring program."

PVP is known to self-assemble into branched hollow fibers in aqueous and alcoholic solutions; we utilized this property to develop dissolvable patches of microneedles. Proteins were dissolved in concentrated PVP solution in both alcohol and water, poured into polydimethylsiloxane templates shaped as microneedles and, upon evaporation of solvent, formed into concentric, fibrous, layered structures. This approach of making PVP microneedles overcomes problems in dosage, uniform delivery and stability of protein formulation as compared to protein-coated metallic microneedles or photopolymerized PVP microneedles. Here we characterize the PVP microneedles and measure the delivery of proteins into skin. We show that our method of fabrication preserves the protein conformation. These microneedles can serve as a broadly useful platform for delivering protein antigens and therapeutic proteins to the skin, for example for allergen skin testing or immunotherapy."

The evaluation and assessment of the virulence and diversity of Bgh populations help to determine effective sources of resistance to the pathogen. 515 isolates were collected from seven populations of Bgh on cultivated barley in seven geographically distant locations in 2006. Their virulence was determined by inoculation onto 26 differential host lines. All of the isolates belonged to 58 pathotypes and 13 of which included 81% of these isolates. The most abundant pathotype was pathotype 0047 (18.3%), the second most abundant was pathotype 0045 (11.8%) and the third most abundant was pathotype 0057 (7.8%). Most of virulent genes investigated in this study showed similar frequencies in the seven different areas. These indicate that the seven locations may be in a uniform epidemiological region and barley cultivars in these areas may have similar genetic background. Diversities within these populations and distances between these populations measured by KOIND package were different. Correlations were not found between the genetic distance and the geographical distances between different locations. This suggested that long distance spread and local epidemics existed in the major winter barley growing regions in China."

Tuning cell每surface affinity to direct cell specific responses to patterned proteins,"S谷bastien G. Ricoult, Greta Thompson-Steckel, James P. Correia, Timothy E. Kennedy, David Juncker, ","Biomaterials, Volume 35, Issue 2, January 2014, Pages 727-736, ","Interactions with local extracellular cues direct cell migration. A versatile method to study cell response to a protein consists of patterning the protein cue on a substrate and quantifying the distribution of cells between patterned and non-patterned areas. Here, we define the concepts of (i) cell每surface affinity to describe cell choices, and of (ii) reference surface (RS) to clarify that the choice is made relative to a reference. Furthermore, we report a method to systematically tune the RS and show that it can dominate the experimental cell response to a protein cue. The cell response to a cue can be switched from strong preference to strong aversion by only changing the RS. Using microcontact printing, we patterned the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin or netrin-1 adjacent to a series of RSs with different ratios of poly-d-lysine (PDL) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), which are of high affinity and of low-affinity for cells, respectively. C2C12 myoblasts or primary neurons seeded on substrates with a high affinity RS (high % PDL) did not respond to a printed protein of interest, and conversely on RSs of low affinity (high % PEG) the cells preferred the printed protein even in the absence of a specific interaction. However, when testing cell response to a standardized series of RSs varying from high to low affinity, a specific response curve was obtained that was unique to each cell type每protein pair. Importantly, for intermediate RSs with moderate affinity, the cell response to the cue was dependent on the activation of biologically relevant protein-specific biochemical signal transduction pathways. Our results establish that choices made by cells in response to a surface-bound cue must take into account, and be interpreted in the context of, the RS. The use of a series of RSs with varying cell每surface affinity reveals specific response curves of cells to a cue that can be compared quantitatively and that may help gain new insights into cellular responses to extracellular proteins."

The optimizations of the Colburn factor j and the friction factor f were treated as the multi-objective optimization problem due to the presence of two conflicting objectives. The second generation Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) was employed to optimize the shape of the heat exchanger. The optimization results indicated that the Colburn factor j increased by 12.83% and the friction factor f decreased by 26.91%, which showed that the convective heat transfer was enhanced and the flow resistance was also significantly reduced. Then, internal flow fields involving temperature, pressure and velocity were qualitatively compared to further emphasize the optimization effect. Finally, the field synergy numbers were compared and analyzed, which could help to prove the rationality of the optimized result and guide the following design or optimization tasks."
Better learning for bidirectional associative memory,"Xinhua Zhuang, Yan Huang, Su-Shing Chen, ","Neural Networks, Volume 6, Issue 8, 1993, Pages 1131-1146, ","In this paper, we are to develop better learning rules for the bidirectional associative memory (BAM) based on three well-recognized optimal criteria, that is, all desired attractors should be made not only stable but also asymptotically stable, and spurious memories should be the fewest possible. We first explore the equivalence between the stability of all desired attractors and certain bidirectional linear separabilities and then relate three optimal criteria to expanding the kernal basin of attraction of each desired attractor in both the X-space and Y-space. To characterize this, we define an important and equivalent concept called by the Hamming-stability. Surprisingly, the Hamming-stability of all desired attractors turns out to be further equivalent to certain moderately expansive bidirectional linear separabilities. As a result, the well-known Rosenblatt's perceptron learning rule can be used to achieve the stability of all desired attractors and even three optimal criteria. The learning rules developed thereofare called the bidirectional perceptron stability learning rule (BPSL) and bidirectional perceptron Hamming-stability learning rule (BPHSL). A number of computer experiments show the improved performance of the BAM trained by the BPSL or BPHSL in regard to its stability, asymptotic stability, and spurious memories."

Five different cases were designed as Case 1: flow channel without any pin fin or porous metal foam insertion, Case 2: flow channel with aluminum pin fins, Case 3: flow channel with porous aluminum foam pin fins, Case 4: fully inserted flow channel with porous aluminum foam, and Case 5: fully inserted flow channel with porous aluminum foam and aluminum pin fins. The effects of porous aluminum insertions, pin fin types, air flow inlet temperature, and air flow inlet velocity on the temperature uniformity and maximum temperature inside the battery pack were systematically investigated. The results showed that using pin fin heat sink (Case 2) is appropriate only for low air flow velocities. In addition, the use of porous aluminum pin fins or embedding porous aluminum foam inside the air flow channel (Cases 3 and 4) are not beneficial for thermal management improvement. The combination of aluminum pin fins and porous aluminum foam insertion inside the air flow channel (Case 5) is a proper option that improves both temperature reduction and temperature uniformity inside the battery cell."

General solutions for consolidation of multilayered soil with a vertical drain system,"Jia-Cai Liu, Guo-Hui Lei, Ming-Xin Zheng, ","Geotextiles and Geomembranes, Volume 42, Issue 3, June 2014, Pages 267-276, ","A quasi-analytical method is newly introduced to solve the equal-strain consolidation problem of multilayered soil with a vertical drain system. Both vertical and radial drainage conditions are considered, together with the effects of drain resistance and smear. By using the method of Laplace transform with respect to time, a general explicit analytical solution for the consolidation in transformed space is obtained. Numerical inversion of the Laplace transform in the time domain is then applied to obtain the solution for calculating excess pore-water pressure. This solution is explicitly expressed and conveniently coded into a computer program for ease and efficiency of practical use. Its validity and accuracy are verified by comparing the special cases of the proposed solution with a finite-element solution and an available analytical solution. Moreover, the consolidation behavior of a four-layered soil with a vertical drain is investigated. The order of soil layers is shown to have a significant effect on the behavior of consolidation. This highlights that caution should be exercised when weighted average consolidation parameters of multilayered soil are used to analyze the consolidation behavior."
Operational distortion每quantization curve-based bit allocation for smooth video quality,"Junqiang Lan, Wenjun Zeng, Xinhua Zhuang, ","Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, Volume 16, Issues 4每5, August每October 2005, Pages 527-543, ","Quality fluctuation has a major negative effect on subjective video quality. A desirable single-pass frame-level constant-distortion bit allocation scheme is proposed in the paper for smooth video quality throughout the video sequence. The average distortion of all previous coded frames is taken as the target distortion for the current frame. According to the linear rate control algorithm [Z. He, S.K. Mitra, A linear source model and a unified rate control algorithm for DCT video coding, IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. Video Technol. 12 (2002) 970每982; Z. He, S.K.

Based on the distribution of the absolute DCT coefficients, an operational distortion每quantization stepsize (D每Q) relationship curve can be established quickly. With the target distortion and operational D每Q curve, we then derive the close-form formulas for estimating the number of zero coefficients and the slope 牟 in the linear rate model, as well as the bit budget for the current frame. Experimental results show that the proposed constant-distortion (but variable rate) bit allocation scheme provides much smoother video quality on all test video sequences than the constant bit allocation scheme that has been used in many standard video coding reference software."

Nevertheless, a number of key issues have hampered their use as drug candidates. A series of new technologies have recently been developed that allow peptides to be viable drug candidates in areas usually restricted to protein therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies. These include the development of various types of peptide每conjugates that have lower rates of clearance and hence the potential to increase the exposure of peptide drug candidates in chronic diseases. Structural additions have also been made to peptides, including the use of unnatural amino acids, mainchain modifications and other novel substitutions, which have helped to improve peptide stability and further their therapeutic potential."
Analysis for seismic response of dry storage facility for spent fuel,"Yung-Yen Ko, Shang-Yi Hsu, Cheng-Hsing Chen, ","Nuclear Engineering and Design, Volume 239, Issue 1, January 2009, Pages 158-168, ","Most of the dry storage systems for spent fuel are freestanding, which leads to stability concerns in an earthquake. In this study, as a safety check, the ABAQUS/Explicit code is adopted to analyse the seismic response of the dry storage facility planned to be installed at Nuclear Power Plant #1 (NPP1) in Taiwan. A 3D coupled finite element (FE) model was established, which consisted of a freestanding cask, a concrete pad, and underneath soils interacting with frictional contact interfaces. The scenario earthquake used in the model included an artificial earthquake compatible to the design spectrum of NPP1, and a strong ground motion modified from the time history recorded during the Chi每Chi earthquake. The results show that the freestanding cask will slide, but not tip over, during strong earthquakes. The scale of the sliding is very small and a collision between casks will not occur. In addition, the differential settlement of the foundation pad that takes place due to the weight of the casks increases the sliding potential of the casks during earthquakes."
Temporal context in human fMRI,"Fang Wang, Rachel A Diana, ","Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences, Volume 17, October 2017, Pages 57-64, ","Memory for personally experienced events includes temporal context that allows organization and retrieval according to sequence. This review compares fMRI studies of temporal context, assessing the processes required within each paradigm. Prefrontal cortex is important for temporal sequence memory, perhaps due to its role in organizing information online, and relative recency judgments, perhaps due to its role in evaluating familiarity. Hippocampal and parahippocampal regions are also involved in these tasks but make reduced contributions to relative recency when familiarity is diagnostic. Parahippocampal cortex contributions to accurate sequence memory are also reduced when multiple encoding repetitions are used. Finally, implicit temporal memory paradigms show that hippocampal and parahippocampal representations are sensitive to temporal context in the absence of mnemonic task demands."
Anti-osteoclastic effect of caffeic acid phenethyl ester in murine macrophages depends upon the suppression of superoxide anion production through the prevention of an active-Nox1 complex formation,"Yong-Beom Kwon, Fang-Fang Wang, Hae-Dong Jang, ","The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, Volume 58, August 2018, Pages 158-168, ","This study investigated the anti-osteoclastic effect of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) through suppression of Nox1-mediated superoxide anions production. The multi-nucleated cells were counted and followed by measuring their tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity. The superoxide anion production was determined by using fluorescent probe dihydroethidium (DHE). After one day of exposure to the receptor activator of nuclear factor-百B ligand (RANKL), the expression of the proteins involved in superoxide anion production was determined by western blotting. A potent anti-osteoclastic effect of CAPE was observed; the superoxide anion level reached a maximum value after one day of incubation. CAPE attenuated the expression of NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase 1 (Nox1) and Rac1, and mitigated the RANKL-induced translocation of p47phox to the cell membrane. In addition, CAPE suppressed the expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-百B p65), its translocation to the nucleus, and the activation of NF-百B inhibitor (I百B汐) and its kinase (IKK汕). Furthermore, CAPE diminished the expression and activation of the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the expression of protein-1 activators (AP-1) such as c-Fos and c-Jun. The expression of Nox1 was suppressed by CAPE through the down-regulation of IKK汕/I百B汐/NF-百B and JNK/AP-1 signal pathway. This study provides evidence that the anti-osteoclastic effect of CAPE depends upon the attenuated superoxide anion production, which is closely related with interruption of an active Nox1 complex formation due to the attenuated catalytic subunit Nox1 expression resulting from suppression of the IKK汕/I百B汐/NF-百B and JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway and the down-regulation of the p47phox subunit translocation to the cell membrane.Download high-res image (154KB)Download full-size image"

We sought to test whether or not rasagiline 1 mg/day can prolong survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis also receiving riluzole.Patients with possible, probable, or definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were enrolled to our randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, phase 2 trial from 15 German network for motor neuron diseases (MND-NET) centres (university hospitals or clinics). Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years, had onset of progressive weakness within the 36 months before the study, had disease duration of more than 6 months and less than 3 years, and had a best-sitting slow vital capacity of at least 50%. After a 4-week screening period, eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either rasagiline (1 mg/day) or placebo in addition to riluzole (100 mg/day), after stratification for site of onset (bulbar or spinal) and study centre. Patients and all personnel assessing outcome parameters were masked to treatment allocation. Patients were followed up 2, 6, 12, and 18 months after randomisation. The primary endpoint was survival time, defined as the time to death or time to study cutoff date (ie, the last patient's last visit plus 14 days). Analyses of primary outcome and safety measures were done in all patients who received at least one dose of trial treatment (intention-to-treat population). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01879241.Between July 2, 2013, and Nov 11, 2014, 273 patients were screened for eligibility, and 252 patients were randomly assigned to receive rasagiline (n=127) or placebo (n=125). 126 patients taking rasagiline and 125 taking placebo were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. For the primary outcome, the survival probability at the end of the study was 0﹞43 (95% CI 0﹞25每0﹞59) in the rasagiline group (n=126) and 0﹞53 (0﹞43每0﹞62) in the placebo group (n=125). The estimated effect size (hazard ratio) was 0﹞91 (one-sided 97﹞5% CI 每infinity to 1﹞34; p=0﹞31).

Frequency of adverse events were comparable between both groups.Rasagiline was safe in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. There was no difference between groups in the primary outcome of survival, although post-hoc analysis suggested that rasagiline might modify disease progression in patients with an initial slope of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised greater than 0﹞5 points per month at baseline.

Representation of response alternatives in human presupplementary motor area: Multi-voxel pattern analysis in a go/no-go task,"John R. Fedota, Jillian E. Hardee, Koraly P谷rez-Edgar, James C. Thompson, ","Neuropsychologia, Volume 56, April 2014, Pages 110-118, ","A debate exists as to the role of the presupplementary motor area (preSMA) in cognitive control. Recent findings suggest that preSMA plays a central role in conflict resolution and encodes response alternatives as opposed to simply the presence of conflict. Evidence of neuronal heterogeneity within preSMA of non-human primates suggests that univariate analysis of functional MRI data may not provide adequate resolution to fully characterize cognitive control-related responses. Here, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) is employed to examine the distributed patterns of activity in preSMA associated with both successful go responses and no-go inhibitions. In a go/no-go task, univariate analysis showed undifferentiated activation of preSMA in response to both go and no-go stimuli. However, when an anatomically-defined preSMA ROI was subjected to MVPA, a significant difference in the activation pattern encoded by go as compared to no-go stimuli was observed. These differences in preSMA activation are consistent with the ongoing maintenance and manipulation of stimulus每action representations."

International consensus on definition and criteria of borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 2017,"Shuji Isaji, Shugo Mizuno, John A. Windsor, Claudio Bassi, Christopher L. Wolfgang, ","Pancreatology, Volume 18, Issue 1, January 2018, Pages 2-11, ","This statement was developed to promote international consensus on the definition of borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (BR-PDAC) which was adopted by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) in 2006, but which has changed yearly and become more complicated. Based on a symposium held during the 20th meeting of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) in Sendai, Japan, in 2016, the presenters sought consensus on issues related to BR-PDAC. We defined patients with BR-PDAC according to the three distinct dimensions: anatomical (A), biological (B), and conditional (C). Anatomic factors include tumor contact with the superior mesenteric artery and/or celiac artery of less than 180∼ without showing stenosis or deformity, tumor contact with the common hepatic artery without showing tumor contact with the proper hepatic artery and/or celiac artery, and tumor contact with the superior mesenteric vein and/or portal vein including bilateral narrowing or occlusion without extending beyond the inferior border of the duodenum. Biological factors include potentially resectable disease based on anatomic criteria but with clinical findings suspicious for (but unproven) distant metastases or regional lymph nodes metastases diagnosed by biopsy or positron emission tomography-computed tomography. This also includes a serum carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19每9 level more than 500 units/ml. Conditional factors include the patients with potentially resectable disease based on anatomic and biologic criteria and with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or more. The definition of BR-PDAC requires one or more positive dimensions (e.g. A, B, C, AB, AC, BC or ABC). The present definition acknowledges that resectability is not just about the anatomic relationship between the tumor and vessels, but that biological and conditional dimensions are also important. The aim in presenting this consensus definition is also to highlight issues which remain controversial and require further research."
Bioconjugates for targeted delivery of therapeutic oligonucleotides,"Xin Ming, Brian Laing, ","Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, Volume 87, 29 June 2015, Pages 81-89, ","Bioconjugates have been used to deliver therapeutic oligonucleotides to their pharmacological targets in diseased cells. Molecular-scale conjugates can be prepared by directly linking targeting ligands with oligonucleotides and the resultant conjugates can selectively bind to cell surface receptors in target cells in diseased tissues. Besides targeted delivery, additional functionality can be incorporated in the conjugates by utilization of carrier molecules, and these larger conjugates are called carrier-associated conjugates. Both molecular and carrier-associated conjugates have achieved initial successes in clinical trials for treating liver diseases; therefore, currently the greater challenge is to deliver oligonucleotides to extrahepatic tissues such as tumors. This review will provide an update on the application of oligonucleotide conjugates for targeted delivery during the last decade. By identifying key elements for successful delivery, it is suggested that oligonucleotide conjugates with intermediate size, cell targeting ability, and endosomal release functionality are superior systems to advance oligonucleotides to achieve their full therapeutic potentials.Download high-res image (269KB)Download full-size image"
Switchable heat transfer in nano Janus-interface-system,"Longyan Zhang, Jinliang Xu, Qicheng Chen, Sheng Wang, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 127, Part B, December 2018, Pages 761-771, ","Janus-interface-system is referred as liquid confined between hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, nanoscale energy transfer in Janus-interface-system is not understood. Here, we investigate Poiseuille flow by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) using argon as the working fluid. The two solid walls hold different temperatures and wettabilities. It is found that for pure heat conduction, temperature jumps are negative on hot wall but positive on cold wall to create positive heat flow from hot wall to cold wall (called positive heat transfer). However, the convective energy transfer in Janus-interface-system always behaves positive temperature jumps on the two walls due to viscous heating. We show that, lowering hot wall wettabilities creates more significant velocity and temperature slippages on hot wall than those on cold wall to steepen liquid temperature gradients in nanochannel. We further show that heat flow sign can be switched between positive and negative, by (1) keeping super-hydrophilic hot wall but changing cold wall wettabilities, (2) keeping super-hydrophilic-hot-wall/hydrophobic-cold-wall but varying external forces applied to liquid, and (3) keeping super-hydrophilic-hot-wall/hydrophobic-cold-wall but varying hot wall temperatures. All the three cases yield non-symmetry velocity profile and more sensitive changes of temperature jumps on cold wall than those on hot wall for heat transfer switch. The transition between positive and negative heat transfer occurs at the zero temperature gradient in the channel. The findings not only enhance the understating of nanoscale energy transfer in Janus-interface-system, but also provide novel working principle for nano-devices behaving temperature sensitive nature.Download high-res image (107KB)Download full-size image"
Values of decentralized systems that avoid investments in idle capacity within the wastewater sector: A theoretical justification,"Sheng Wang, ","Journal of Environmental Management, Volume 136, 1 April 2014, Pages 68-75, ","In this work, the values of decentralized (onsite) systems that avoid investments in idle capacity within wastewater plans are quantitatively justified using the specific net present value (SNPV) approach. SNPV is a currently proposed criterion in environmental engineering economics that is defined as the net present value of the cost per unit of service or per population equivalent (PE). The SNPV approach was reintroduced with bugs fixed and then applied to the economic analysis of the capital and operating costs of one-stage completed central plants, stage-expanded central plants, and decentralized treatment facilities. The results show that under a demand growth scenario, the central plant will inevitably reach idle capacity, which can be reduced by a staged expansion. However, the staged expansion plan will lose the economies of scale and, hence, is only viable under projections of a low or moderate price inflation rate or high demand growth rate. Onsite treatment systems can theoretically achieve 100% utilization. Assuming that the capital costs per PE of the onsite and central systems are equal, the former is economically favorable in most cases of price inflation as a result of its cost saving on idle capacity. Onsite treatment systems can be viable even though their capital expenditures per PE are higher than that of a comparable centralized option as to a capital investment. This finding suggests wide opening of onsite technology choices. Use of the SNPV showed that average operating expenses of centralized plants decrease as demand growth rates increase as a benefit of economies of scale, whereas those of onsite treatment systems depend only on price inflation. Semi-decentralized systems feature both the financial advantage of the onsite system (capital investment) and the superiority of centralized systems (operation and maintenance); thus, it is worth consideration. The results of this study illustrate not only the value of decentralized systems but also the value of the SNPV approach in the planning of wastewater services, especially in areas undergoing high demand growth."

Quantifying the range of cross-correlated fluctuations using a q每L dependent AHXA coefficient,"Fang Wang, Lin Wang, Yuming Chen, ","Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, Volume 494, 15 March 2018, Pages 454-464, ","Recently, based on analogous height cross-correlation analysis (AHXA), a cross-correlation coefficient 老℅(L) has been proposed to quantify the levels of cross-correlation on different temporal scales for bivariate series. A limitation of this coefficient is that it cannot capture the full information of cross-correlations on amplitude of fluctuations. In fact, it only detects the cross-correlation at a specific order fluctuation, which might neglect some important information inherited from other order fluctuations. To overcome this disadvantage, in this work, based on the scaling of the qth order covariance and time delay L, we define a two-parameter dependent cross-correlation coefficient 老q(L) to detect and quantify the range and level of cross-correlations. This new version of 老q(L) coefficient leads to the formation of a 老q(L) surface, which not only is able to quantify the level of cross-correlations, but also allows us to identify the range of fluctuation amplitudes that are correlated in two given signals. Applications to the classical ARFIMA models and the binomial multifractal series illustrate the feasibility of this new coefficient 老q(L). In addition, a statistical test is proposed to quantify the existence of cross-correlations between two given series. Applying our method to the real life empirical data from the 1999每2000 California electricity market, we find that the California power crisis in 2000 destroys the cross-correlation between the price and the load series but does not affect the correlation of the load series during and before the crisis."

With a sample of 2178 reviews from mobile gaming applications, we report that reviewer profile image can significantly enhance consumer's evaluation of review helpfulness; whereas there is no differential effect among image types (i.e. self, family, or random images). Interestingly, the effect of reviewer profile image on review helpfulness is moderated by review length, but not review valence and equivocality.

Supply chain coordination under vendor managed inventory-consignment stocking contracts with wholesale price constraint and fairness,"Benyong Hu, Chao Meng, Dong Xu, Young-Jun Son, ","International Journal of Production Economics, Volume 202, August 2018, Pages 21-31, ","In the retailing industry, dominant retailers usually set constraints on a supplier's wholesale price and obtain most of the supply chain profit. This unfair profit allocation may cause bankruptcy of small suppliers due to low margins. This paper investigates the supply chain coordination under a vendor managed inventory-consignment stocking contract with wholesale price constraint and fairness considerations. First, we derive the retailer's optimal wholesale price constraint (WPC) and the supplier's optimal production quantity. Then, we derive the supply chain coordination condition by considering the fairness of profit allocation between the retailer and the supplier. Our analyses show that increasing the fairness preference not only restricts the retailer's utility function and WPC, but also increases the supplier's expected profit and production quantity. Furthermore, supply chain coordination can be achieved only when the retailer has a large fairness preference. Through a simulation study of multiple-period decision-making problems, we illustrate the benefits and motivation for the retailer to consider fairness in profit allocation when production cost and market demand are uncertain."

We developed guidelines through international expert consensus opinion to standardize the diagnosis and clinical staging of GVHD for use in a large international GVHD research consortium. During the first year of use, the guidance followed discussion of complex clinical phenotypes by experienced transplant physicians and data managers. These guidelines increase the uniformity of GVHD symptom capture, which may improve the reproducibility of GVHD clinical trials after further prospective validation."
"Amide-functionalized metal每organic frameworks: Syntheses, structures and improved gas storage and separation properties","Dong-Xu Xue, Qian Wang, Junfeng Bai, ","Coordination Chemistry Reviews, In press, corrected proof, Available online 13 November 2017, ","Metal每organic frameworks (MOFs), emerging as a new type of solid state porous material, have received intensive attention in academia and industry over the last two decades. MOF materials demonstrate not only intriguing structures/topologies, but also a variety of functionalities/applications, i.e., mediating the currentdemanding energy crisis and environmental pollution. We are interested in the design and self-assembly of functional MOF materials to improve carbon dioxide, hydrogen, methane and acetylene storage capabilities, as well as the separation efficiencies toward flue gas and nature gas. Therefore, significant efforts have been devoted to construct a subclass of amide-functionalized metal每organic frameworks (AFMOFs) in the last decade in our research group to target the above-mentioned applications. Due to the intrinsic nature, i.e., flexibility and polarizability of amide groups, the resultant AFMOFs unveil a myriad of graceful structures/topologies in combination with enhanced gas storage and separation properties. Depending on where the amide groups are implanted into the organic backbones, two types of AFMOFs were essentially afforded in our research group. In this review, we first pay some attention to the synthesis and structures of dynamic AFMOFs, in which the amide groups are built between carboxymethyl and phenyl rings, then we discuss the designs, syntheses and constructions of robust AFMOFs by means of several intriguingly topological platforms, i.e., pcu-, agw-, nbo-, rht-, pbz- and txt-MOFs, where the amide groups are built between two phenyl rings. Later, several outstanding AFMOFs are chosen to elucidate their applications for energy gas storage and carbon capture, as well as acetylene safe handling.This review summarizes syntheses, structures of the amide-functionalized metal每organic frameworks (AFMOFs) with improved gas storage and separation properties mainly based upon our recent work. Depending where the amide groups are implanted into organic backbones, two types of AFMOFs, dynamic and robust AFMOFs were presented. After describing their syntheses and structures, in particular, several intriguingly topological platforms, i.e., pcu-, agw-, nbo-, rht-, pbz- and txt-MOFs, several outstanding AFMOFs are chosen to elucidate their applications for energy gas storage and carbon capture as well as acetylene safe handling.Download high-res image (117KB)Download full-size image"
Histological evaluation of soya bean-induced enteritis in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.): Quantitative image analysis vs. semi-quantitative visual scoring,"Polyana F. Silva, Charles McGurk, David L. Knudsen, Alexandra Adams, James E. Bron, ","Aquaculture, Volume 445, 1 August 2015, Pages 42-56, ","This paper describes a first broad-scale application of quantitative image analysis to the assessment of nutritionally-induced soya bean enteritis in farmed Atlantic salmon. It employs a novel multivariate approach for the histomorphometric analysis of biopsy samples and directly compares the prognostic value of such a quantitative approach against that of a semi-quantitative visual scoring system.This study provides evidence that most of the quantitative indices selected, perform equally well when compared to analogous semi-quantitative descriptive parameters normally used to assess soya bean-induced enteritis seen in Atlantic salmon. The high reproducibility and accuracy of this approach indicate that image analysis can provide a useful and reliable method for the quantification of SB-induced enteritis and by extension, for other facets of gut plasticity/histopathology. Other characteristics of this approach, such as rapidity, simplicity and adaptability similarly favour the use of image analysis, and are particularly useful where less experienced interpreters are performing the analysis. The quantitative assessment system outlined here, clearly identifies soya bean-associated enteropathy in experimental fish, and may thus be recommended for evaluation of related variations in salmon intestinal histomorphology."

Improving wettability and preventing Li-ion batteries from thermal runaway using microchannels,"Shahabeddin K. Mohammadian, Yuwen Zhang, ","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 118, March 2018, Pages 911-918, ","Effects of using microchannels on the wettability of the porous electrodes and preventing the battery cell from thermal runaway have been studied. Two-dimensional Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulation was carried out to simulate the effects of embedded microchannels inside the electrodes on the electrolyte transport in the porous electrodes as well as their effects to lead the generated gases during thermal runaway out of the battery cell. The two-phase intermolecular potential model was utilized to investigate the microscopic behavior of the electrolyte flow in the porous electrodes. The results showed that embedding microchannels inside the electrodes significantly improves the wettability of the electrodes, especially for the electrodes with lower porosities. Furthermore, the use of microchannels inside the electrodes could considerably reduce possibility of occurrence of the thermal runaway. During thermal runaway, the electrodes with higher number of smaller microchannels could drive the generated gases out of the battery cell much quicker than the electrodes with lower number of larger microchannels."
Effect of intermittent versus continuous enteral feeding on energy expenditure in premature infants,"Judith Grant, Scott C. Denne, ","The Journal of Pediatrics, Volume 118, Issue 6, June 1991, Pages 928-932, ","The purpose of this study was to examine whether premature infants have higher rates of energy expenditure and diet-induced thermogenesis during intermittent feeding compared with continuous feeding. Using open-circult respiratory calorimetry, we measured energy expenditure in 11 premature newborn infants on 2 successive days for 5 to 7 hours during and after either intermittent or contiuous feeding. Infants were fed the same quantity of formula each day, either for 5 minutes or by continuous drip for 2 to 3 hours. The order of feeding type was randomized. No response of diet-induced thermogenesis to continuous feeding was found, whereas a peak increase of 15% over baseline was observed after intermittent feeding. Overall energy expenditure during the study period was significantly greater after intermittent compared with continuous feeding (2.18㊣0.07 kcal/kg per hour vs 2.09㊣0.05 kcal/kg per hour; p<0.05). Thus there was a mean 4% difference (range up to 17%) in energy expenditure between the two feeding modes. These results are similar to those obtained with adults and support the concept of the increased energy efficiency of continuous feeding. Further study will be necessary to document whether the increased energy efficiency provided by continuous feeding may be clinically significant."
Hypospadias: a contemporary epidemiologic assessment,"Michael L Gallentine, Allen F Morey, Ian M Thompson, ","Urology, Volume 57, Issue 4, April 2001, Pages 788-790, ","Objectives.To determine whether the incidence of hypospadias is increasing and whether racial differences among patients are significant, we evaluated the current incidence of hypospadias and patient race in an equal-access healthcare system.Methods.We undertook a retrospective review of discharge records between 1990 and 1998 from 15 military treatment facilities to determine the total number of male live births and the number of male live births with hypospadias reported by race (categorized as white, black, Asian, Native American, and unknown).Results.Among 99,210 male live births, 709 cases of hypospadias were identified (0.7%). Of the total male live births, 68,444 were white, 18,984 were black, 1761 were Asian, 175 were Native American, and 9846 were unknown, with an incidence of hypospadias of 0.8%, 0.6%, 0.5%, 0.6%, and 0.6%, respectively. Racial differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.2).Conclusions.The 0.7% incidence of hypospadias detected is near the upper limit of what has been historically reported. No significant difference between races was found, but the incidence of hypospadias in minorities is higher than previously reported."

Dynamic trends in online product ratings: A diagnostic utility explanation,"Fang Wang, Kalyani Menon, Chatura Ranaweera, ","Journal of Business Research, Volume 87, June 2018, Pages 80-89, ","We propose and test an alternative diagnostic utility explanation for trends in customer ratings of products on online reviews/ratings sites. Ratings by prior customers provide key diagnostic information to help prospective customers in their purchase decision. The outcomes of these purchase decisions are reflected in the ratings posted by these later customers. Therefore, rating trends depend on the diagnostic utility of the ratings environment. We suggest that this diagnostic utility is a function of the degree of heterogeneity in the ratings environment and customer diagnostic ability. Using two data sets - from Landsend.com and from Amazon.com, we show a predominant increasing rating trend and support for our diagnostic utility explanation. Ratings show an increasing trend unless heterogeneity in the ratings environment increases and customer diagnostic ability decreases."

Five electronic databases and two online-specific PROM databases were searched. Two groups of reviewers independently screened all abstracts for eligible PROMs. Descriptive characteristics of the eligible PROMs were collected, and items and domains of each questionnaire were mapped onto the ICF-CY chapters.We identified 35 PROMs, of which 29 were generic PROMs and 6 were preference-based measures. Many PROMs cover a range of aspects of health; however, social functioning is represented most often. Content covered differs both in which aspects of health are assessed and whether individual questions focus on functioning (what the subject can or does do) and/or well-being (how the subject feels about a certain aspect of his or her health).A broad variety of PROMs is available to assess children＊s health. Nevertheless, only a few PROMs can be used across all age ranges to 18 years. When mapping their content on the ICF-CY, it seems that most PROMs exclude at least one major domain, and all conflate aspects of functioning and well-being in the scales."
Beneficial effects of systemic immunoglobulin in experimental membranous nephropathy,"Masaomi Nangaku, Jeff Pippin, Catherine A. Richardson, Matthias Schulze, William G. Couser, ","Kidney International, Volume 50, Issue 6, December 1996, Pages 2054-2062, ","Beneficial effects of systemic immunoglobulin in experimental membranous nephropathy. To test the hypothesis that systemic administration of immunoglobulin might reduce glomerular injury in membranous nephropathy through mechanisms involving inhibition of complement activation, we studied the passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) model of membranous nephropathy in rats. The daily administration of immunoglobulin goat IgG (600 mg/kg i.p.) reduced proteinuria by 52%. Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis showed that the glomerular deposition of C3c, an indicator of ongoing complement attack, and of C5b-9 was significantly decreased in the immunoglobulin treated group, while deposition of anti-Fx1A was not affected. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that the extent of subepithelial immune complexes did not appreciably differ between treated and control animals. Systemic complement levels were not altered by immunoglobulin treatment. These data suggest that the reduction in proteinuria that resulted from systemic immunoglobulin administration was mediated by modifying the effect of complement induced glomerular injury. This interpretation was further supported by in vitro data that documented a significant reduction in C5b-9 induced glomerular epithelial cell lysis in the presence of both goat and rat IgG. These results indicate that systemic administration of immunoglobulin can substantially reduce ongoing complement activation in the glomerulus in PHN rats and that this effect is associated with a significant reduction in glomerular injury."
Conditional Value-at-Risk: Semiparametric estimation and inference,"Chuan-Sheng Wang, Zhibiao Zhao, ","Journal of Econometrics, Volume 195, Issue 1, November 2016, Pages 86-103, ","Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) plays an important role in financial risk management. Nonparametric CVaR estimation suffers from the ※curse of dimensionality§ and slow convergence rate. To overcome these issues, we study semiparametric CVaR estimation and inference for parametric model with nonparametric noise distribution. Under a general framework that allows for many widely used time series models, we propose a semiparametric CVaR estimator that achieves the parametric convergence rate. Furthermore, to draw simultaneous inference for CVaR at multiple confidence levels, we establish a functional central limit theorem for CVaR process indexed by the confidence level and use it to study the conditional expected shortfall. A user-friendly bootstrap approach is introduced to facilitate non-expert practitioners to perform confidence interval construction for CVaR. The methodology is illustrated through both Monte Carlo studies and an application to S&P 500 index."

Data collection for attack detection and security measurement in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks: A survey,"Gao Liu, Zheng Yan, Witold Pedrycz, ","Journal of Network and Computer Applications, Volume 105, 1 March 2018, Pages 105-122, ","Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is becoming one type of major next generation wireless networks. Nevertheless, it easily suffers from various attacks due to its specific characteristics. In order to evaluate and measure the security of MANET in real time and make this network react accordingly, a promising alternative is to integrate detection mechanisms that play a role of the second line of defense to detect attacks in MANETs. We note that in most attack detection mechanisms, it is essential and crucial to collect the data related to security for further analysis. If security-related data collection is untrustworthy, attack detection and security measurement might be impacted and disabled. Unfortunately, few existing studies concern security-related data collection in attack detection for the purpose of trustworthy security measurement. The literature lacks a thorough survey on security-related data collection for attack detection and security measurement in MANETs. In this paper, we propose a number of requirements for trustworthy security-related data collection, and then review detection mechanisms in MANETs that were published in recent 20 years. In particular, we employ the proposed requirements as a set of criteria to evaluate the existing work about security-related data collection. Based on the survey and evaluation, we identify a number of open issues and point out future research directions."
Wavelet multi-resolution analysis on particle dynamics in a horizontal pneumatic conveying,"Yan Zheng, Akira Rinoshika, ","Advanced Powder Technology, Volume 29, Issue 10, October 2018, Pages 2404-2415, ","The particle velocities are measured by the high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) in the acceleration and fully developed regimes of a horizontal pneumatic conveying. Based on the measured particle fluctuation velocities, continuous wavelet transform and one-dimensional orthogonal wavelet decomposition were applied to reveal particle dynamics in terms of time frequency analysis, the contribution from wavelet level to the particle fluctuation energy, spatial correlation and probability distribution of wavelet levels. The time frequency characteristics of particle fluctuation velocity suggest that the small-scale particle motions are suppressed and tend to transfer into large scale particle motions from acceleration regime to fully developed regime. In the near bottom part of pipe, the fluctuation energy of axial particle motion is mainly contributed from the wavelet levels of relatively low frequency, however, in the near top part of pipe, wavelet levels of relatively high frequency make comparable contribution to the axial particle fluctuation energy in the suspension flow regime, and this contribution decreases as particles are accelerated along the pipe. The low frequency wavelet levels exhibit large spatial correlation, and this spatial correlation increases as the particles flow from acceleration regime to fully developed regime. The skewness factor and kurtosis factor of wavelet level suggest that the deviation of Gaussian probability distribution is associated with the central frequency of wavelet level, and the deviation from Gaussian distribution is more evident as increasing central frequency. The higher wavelet levels can be linked to small sale particle motions, which lead to irregular particle fluctuation velocity.Download high-res image (117KB)Download full-size image"

Multivariate time series are available in the traffic system and we intend to examine the issue for the real data in the traffic system. In this paper, we propose the multivariate predicting method and discuss the prediction performance of multivariate time series by comparison with univariate time series and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) nonparametric regression model. The three kinds of forecast accuracy measure for multivariate predicting method are smaller than those for the other two methods in all cases, which suggest the predicting results for traffic time series by multivariate predicting method are better and more accurate than those based on univariate time series and KNN model. It demonstrates that the proposed multivariate predicting method is more successful in predicting the traffic time series than univariate predicting method and KNN method. The multivariate predicting method has a broad application prospect on prediction because of its advantage on recovering the dynamics of nonlinear system."

A battery model that fully couples mechanics and electrochemistry at both particle and electrode levels by incorporation of particle interaction,"Bin Wu, Wei Lu, ","Journal of Power Sources, Volume 360, 31 August 2017, Pages 360-372, ","This paper develops a multi-scale mechanical-electrochemical model which enables fully coupled mechanics and electrochemistry at both particle and electrode levels. At the particle level, solid diffusion is modeled using a generalized chemical potential to capture the effects of mechanical stress and phase transformation. At the electrode level, the stress arising from particle interaction is incorporated in a continuum model. This particle interaction stress is in addition to the traditional concept of intercalation stress inside isolated particles. The particle and continuum electrode levels are linked by the particle interaction stress as loads on the particle surface, and by consideration of stress on the electrochemical reaction rate on the particle surface. The effect of mechanical stress on electrochemical reaction results in a stress-dependent over-potential between particle and electrolyte. Stress gradient in an electrode leads to inhomogeneous intercalation/deintercalation currents for particles depending on their interaction stress with neighbors, resulting in stress gradient induced inhomogeneous state of charge. Conversely, non-uniform intercalation/deintercalation currents in an electrode lead to stress between particles. With this model we have an important finding: an electrochemically inactive region in an electrode causes stress built-up. This model provides a powerful tool to address various problems such as fracture in-between particles.Download high-res image (157KB)Download full-size image"

The evacuation simulation results indicate that the evacuation time of the entire library and reading room is 411s and 165s respectively. Finally, the fire safety of the library is evaluated by comparing the risk time and evacuation time. It is concluded that the exit of each layer is the first to reach the dangerous state; the direction of the hazardous area is also the direction of safe evacuation. The risk time of the library and the reading room, is the time when the height of smoke down to 2m.

The aim of this clinical-experimental study was to analyze the nAMD associated VH proteome of previously untreated patients whilst taking different groups of nAMD into account, based on their clinical presentation (clinical diagnosis groups). Electrophoresis coupled online to mass spectrometry (CE-MS) as well as liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were used to analyze VH of 108 nAMD patients and 24 controls with idiopathic floaters. A total of 101 different proteins with at least two unique peptides could be identified. Using a stringent statistical analysis with implementation of the closed test principle, we were able to identify four proteins that may be involved in the pathophysiology of nAMD: Clusterin, opticin, pigment epithelium-derived factor and prostaglandin-H2 d-isomerase. Using independent samples, ROC-Area under the curve was determined proving the validity of the results: Clusterin 0.747, opticin 0.656, pigment epithelium-derived factor 0.514, prostaglandin-H2 d-isomerase 0.712. In addition, validation through ELISA measurements was performed. The identified proteins may serve as potential biomarkers or even targets of therapy for nAMD."

Projection support vector regression algorithms for data regression,"Xinjun Peng, Dong Xu, ","Knowledge-Based Systems, Volume 112, 15 November 2016, Pages 54-66, ","Support vector regression (SVR), which has been successfully applied to a variety of real-world problems, simultaneously minimizes the regularization error and empirical risk with a suitable penalty factor. However, it does not embed any prior information of data into the learning process. In this paper, by introducing a new term to seek a projection axis of data points, we present a novel projection SVR (PSVR) algorithm and its least squares version, i.e., least squares PSVR (LS-PSVR). The projection axis not only minimizes the variance of the projected points, but also maximizes the empirical correlation coefficient between the targets and the projected inputs. The finding of axis can be regarded as the structural information of data points, which makes the proposed algorithms be more robust than SVR. The experimental results on several datasets also confirm this conclusion. The idea in this work not only is helpful in understanding the structural information of data, but also can be extended to other regression models."
AAV-mediated hippocampal expression of short and long Homer 1 proteins differentially affect cognition and seizure activity in adult rats,"Matthias Klugmann, C. Wymond Symes, Claudia B. Leichtlein, Bettina K. Klaussner, Matthew J. During, ","Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience, Volume 28, Issue 2, February 2005, Pages 347-360, ","Homer proteins mediate molecular rearrangements leading to changes in spine morphology. This points to a role of Homer in learning and memory. Homer 1c features both the ligand binding domain and a coiled每coiled domain for self-multimerization. Homer 1a lacks the coiled每coiled domain. Here, we report a new isoform which we termed 1g, lacking the Homer ligand binding domain. We dissected the functional roles of the individual Homer 1 domains, encoded by Homer 1a, 1c, and 1g, in vivo. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of these forms in the hippocampus of adult rats has opposing effects on learning behavior. Increased levels of Homer 1a impaired hippocampal-dependent memory, while Homer 1g and 1c slightly enhanced memory performance. Homer 1g induced anxiety. Moreover, AAV-Homer 1a animals showed attenuation of electrographic seizures in a model of status epilepticus. These results suggest that Homer 1 proteins play an active role in behavioral plasticity."
"A friend in need is a friend indeed: Need-based sharing, rather than cooperative assortment, predicts experimental resource transfers among Agta hunter-gatherers","Daniel Smith, Mark Dyble, Katie Major, Abigail E. Page, Ruth Mace, ","Evolution and Human Behavior, In press, corrected proof, Available online 16 August 2018, ","Despite much theorizing, the evolutionary reasons why humans cooperate extensively with unrelated individuals are still largely unknown. While reciprocity explains many instances of non-kin cooperation, much remains to be understood. A recent suite of models based upon ＆cooperative assortativity＊ suggest that non-kin cooperation can evolve if individuals preferentially assort with certain cooperative phenotypes, such as helping those who help others. Here, we test these assortative hypotheses among the Agta, a population of Filipino hunter-gatherers, using an experimental resource allocation game in which individuals divide resources between themselves and camp-mates. Individuals preferentially shared with less cooperative individuals, arguing against cooperative assortativity as a mechanism sustaining resource transfers in this population. Rather, sharing was often based on the recipient's level of need, in addition to kin-based transfers and reciprocal sharing. Contrary to several recent theoretical accounts, in this real-world setting we find no evidence for cooperative assortativity influencing patterns of cooperation. These results may reflect the demands of living in a foraging ecology characterized by high resource stochasticity, necessitating need-based sharing as a system of long-term reciprocity to mitigate repeated subsistence shortfalls."
"An enhanced method of evaluation, assessment, and statistical inference to assist management decisions on coastal access to rocky shores","Scott Kimura, Grant T. Waltz, John R. Steinbeck, Dean E. Wendt, ","Ocean & Coastal Management, Volume 95, July 2014, Pages 241-253, ","Determining the effects of public access on biological communities can be difficult, as both public access and natural influences can be highly variable over time and space. The multiple sources of variation can obscure the magnitude and significance of the changes to species and ecosystem functioning due to public access. Manipulative field experiments simulating foot traffic have been a preferred method for identifying the species most sensitive to impacts from public access. However, using the results to describe the magnitude of change in real situations can be complicated if the treatment applications were not accurate in simulating the amount of foot traffic at the location of concern.Here we describe a novel three-pronged approach that we designed and implemented to help understand the magnitude of impacts from visitor traffic in a highly variable ecological community. We focused on an intertidal rockweed community in central California, U.S.A. numerically dominated by the brown rockweed Silvetia compressa and exposed to moderate levels of foot traffic. We began by determining the numbers of visitors and time spent in popular visited rocky shorelines supporting this type of community. Second, those exposure levels were applied to species of the same community type in a manipulative field experiment in an area of no public access and with the experiment designed as a before-after-control-impact study. The treatments were numbers of people and amount of time spent in large plots, not prescribed footstep numbers in smaller test plots, which has been commonly used in other studies. Third, we completed a field observational study consisting of sampling intertidal species abundances in nearby areas experiencing foot traffic levels similar to those tested in our experiment, and we also sampled adjacent areas with lower/no public access. Our highest treatment exposure resulted in a statistically significant reduction in algal cover of approximately 20%, relative to controls. The amount of change was similar to the differences in algal cover found in the field observational study between the public access and low/no public use areas, which also had similar differences in visitor exposure levels as the manipulative experiment. The consistency of the results between the observational study and field experiment strengthens the inference that the changes were attributable to visitor traffic and not natural variation. The three components of our study can be adapted to other ecosystems for determining impacts to natural resources and for supporting decisions on whether actions are necessary to protect natural resources from public access."
Detection of minimum biomarker features via bi-level optimization framework by nested hybrid differential evolution,"Kai-Cheng Hsu, Feng-Sheng Wang, ","Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers, Volume 81, December 2017, Pages 31-39, ","One of the important tasks in precision medicine is to identify biomarkers and build classification models for clinical diagnose and treatment response. Support vector machine using full features is a common approach for classifying diseases in healthcare systems. However, little literature reported to use it toward determining minimum features of biomarkers. This study introduced a bilevel mixed-integer optimization framework to detect minimum biomarker features for support vector machine. We proposed the two-population nested hybrid differential evolution (NHDE) to solve the optimization problem for selecting the desired biomarkers. In case studies, the accuracies of classification by SVM using full biomarkers were nearly identical to that of 2 biomarkers selected by the minimizing feature approach. Furthermore, the approach could determine that the dopamine packed in vesicle in the presynaptic dopamine overactivity case and S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine in deficient case were the dominant biomarkers, respectively. The two-population NHDE algorithm was more efficient to achieve minimum biomarkers compared with one-population NHDE and traditional genetic algorithm.Download high-res image (119KB)Download full-size image"
Buckling mechanism of steel core and global stability design method for fixed-end buckling-restrained braces,"Junkai Lu, Bin Wu, Yang Mei, ","Engineering Structures, Volume 174, 1 November 2018, Pages 447-461, ","Based on theoretical analyses, the development of buckling mode of steel core is revealed for buckling restrained braces (BRBs) with fixed ends. The formulae are derived for the bending moments of the stiffening part of the core and restraining member of BRBs. Then a global stability design method of fixed-end BRBs is proposed. The results of the contact force, flexural response and buckling half wavelength with finite-element analysis agree with the theoretical analysis. The design criteria as well as the buckling half wavelength were validated by the quasi-static tests of five BRBs. Compared to existing methods, the proposed design approach can ensure a proper safety margin of the stiffening part."
Probabilistic optimal power flow considering dependences of wind speed among wind farms by pair-copula method,"Jia Cao, Zheng Yan, ","International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems, Volume 84, January 2017, Pages 296-307, ","This paper aims at exploring the impacts of high dimensional dependences of wind speed among wind farms on probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF). Kernel density estimate method is employed to estimate probability distribution of wind speed. A joint probability distribution function of wind speed among wind farms is obtained by pair-copula method, which can use variational bivariate copula functions to consider dependences of wind speed between two arbitrary wind farms and overcome the constraints of high dimensional copula function, not taking the mutual dependences of wind speed into account. Finally, the POPF calculation is operated by monte carlo simulation method under four cases to consider high dimensional dependences of wind speed among wind farms. Simulation results show that the impacts of dependences of wind speed on the POPF results exist and that cannot be ignored. Based on the pair-copula method to construct high dimensional dependences, the average relative errors of POPF results is smaller than that by other methods. Besides, the distribution curve of output variables is also close to that obtained by using actual wind speed data. Under the case of high requirements for calculation accuracy, it is a feasible scheme for using pair-copula method to construct dependences of wind speed to calculate POPF."
Transcriptome profiling reveals candidate genes associated with sex differentiation induced by night temperature in cucumber,"Chunhua Wang, Ming Xin, Xiuyan Zhou, Weifeng Liu, Zhiwei Qin, ","Scientia Horticulturae, Volume 232, 17 February 2018, Pages 162-169, ","The sex differentiation of cucumber directly affects cucumber fruit yield, and low night temperature (LT) promotes female flower differentiation. However, studies on the effects of LT on sex differentiation are scarce. To better understand this mechanism, we used transcriptomics to examine the expression patterns of genes related to female flower differentiation in the cucumber cultivar ＆C09-123＊ under LT and high night temperature (HT). We identified a total of 1654 differentially expressed genes in response to LT. There were 1147 up-regulated genes and 507 down-regulated genes under LT compared with their expression under HT. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in cellular process, metabolic process, response to stimulus process and other processes (biological process). Many of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were related to glucose metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism and the ethylene and auxin signal transduction pathway and were up-regulated under LT, which promotes female differentiation, compared with their expression level under HT. These results suggest that changes in these genes are likely to affect the corresponding metabolism, thus inducing the female flower differentiation of cucumber under LT. Ethylene and auxin play important roles in the induction of female flower differentiation under LT. This study provides valuable resources for further exploring the molecular basis of LT induction of female flower differentiation and for enabling targeted breeding strategies for developing varieties with superior strong female differentiation to achieve yield potential."

The results also reveal that web visibility creates higher values for business-to-consumer (B2C) than business-to-business (B2B) firms, for firms with a value appropriation focus than those with a value creation focus, and for firms of search goods than those of experience goods."
High-degree cubature Kalman filter,"Bin Jia, Ming Xin, Yang Cheng, ","Automatica, Volume 49, Issue 2, February 2013, Pages 510-518, ","The cubature Kalman filter (CKF), which is based on the third degree spherical每radial cubature rule, is numerically more stable than the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) but less accurate than the Gauss每Hermite quadrature filter (GHQF). To improve the performance of the CKF, a new class of CKFs with arbitrary degrees of accuracy in computing the spherical and radial integrals is proposed. The third-degree CKF is a special case of the class. The high-degree CKFs of the class can achieve the accuracy and stability performances close to those of the GHQF but at lower computational cost. A numerical integration problem and a target tracking problem are utilized to demonstrate the necessity of using the high-degree cubature rules to improve the performance. The target tracking simulation shows that the fifth-degree CKF can achieve higher accuracy than the extended Kalman filter, the UKF, the third-degree CKF, and the particle filter, and is computationally much more efficient than the GHQF."
The Sigma-1 Receptor as a Pluripotent Modulator in Living Systems,"Tsung-Ping Su, Tzu-Chieh Su, Yoki Nakamura, Shang-Yi Tsai, ","Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, Volume 37, Issue 4, April 2016, Pages 262-278, ","Sig-1R occurs specifically at the MAM, the interface between the ER and mitochondria, where it promotes cellular survival.Upon stimulation by agonists or stressors, Sig-1R can translocate to the PM to interact with ion channels, receptors, and kinases.Experimental and bioinformatics studies have identified interactions between Sig-1R and other functional proteins in the PM, ER, mitochondria, and even the cytosol.CNS diseases have been reported to relate to Sig-1R, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, stroke/ischemia, pain/neuropathic pain, and certain psychiatric disorders.Pharmacological or cellular engineering targeting Sig-1R may provide therapeutic opportunities to treat such diseases.The sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that resides specifically in the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (MAM), an interface between ER and mitochondria. In addition to being able to translocate to the plasma membrane (PM) to interact with ion channels and other receptors, Sig-1R also occurs at the nuclear envelope, where it recruits chromatin-remodeling factors to affect the transcription of genes. Sig-1Rs have also been reported to interact with other membranous or soluble proteins at other loci, including the cytosol, and to be involved in several central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Here, we propose that Sig-1R is a pluripotent modulator with resultant multiple functional manifestations in living systems."
A privacy-preserving mobile application recommender system based on trust evaluation,"Kun Xu, Weidong Zhang, Zheng Yan, ","Journal of Computational Science, Volume 26, May 2018, Pages 87-107, ","Too many mobile applications in App stores results in information overload in App market. Mobile users are confused in choosing suitable and trustworthy mobile applications due to a large number of available candidates. A mobile application recommender system is a powerful tool that helps users solve this problem. However, there are few feasible recommender systems focusing on recommending mobile applications in the literature. First, few researches study user trust behavior based recommendation on mobile applications. Second, the accuracy and personalization of existing recommender systems need to be further improved. Particularly, privacy preservation is still an open issue in mobile application recommendation. In this paper, we propose two privacy-preserving mobile application recommendation schemes based on trust evaluation. Recommendations on mobile application are generated based on user trust behaviors of mobile application usage. In these two schemes, user private data can be preserved by applying our proposed security protocols and utilizing homomorphic encryption. We further implement two schemes and develop two mobile Apps that can be applied in different scenarios, i.e., a centralized cloud service and distributed social networking. Security analysis, performance evaluation and simulation results show that our schemes have sound security, efficiency, accuracy, and robustness."
A novel role of circadian transcription factor DBP in hippocampal plasticity,"Matthias Klugmann, Claudia B. Leichtlein, C. Wymond Symes, Bettina C. Klaussner, Matthew J. During, ","Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience, Volume 31, Issue 2, February 2006, Pages 303-314, ","In neurons, a variety of extracellular stimuli are capable of inducing transcriptional events that underlie complex processes ranging from learning to disease. The mechanisms linking these long-lasting cellular modifications to behavior remain to be established. Here, we show by microarray analysis that hippocampal activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), which is associated with improved learning and neuroprotection, results in suppression of the transcription factor DBP (albumin D-site-binding protein). Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) based gene expression of DBP in the hippocampus of adult rats caused upregulation of mRNAs encoding constituents of the molecular clock, and the DBP target gene, pyridoxal kinase. Behaviorally, DBP over expression inhibited spatial learning but not memory, and enhanced susceptibility to kainate-induced seizures. This phenotype was paralleled by the activation of MAP kinase in dendritic regions of hippocampal neurons in vivo. These data suggest that DBP may represent an important transcriptional link between GLP-1R activation and neuroplasticity in the hippocampus."

In 2010每2012 it resulted in skyrocketing prices and supply deficit for most REEs, leading to numerous new REE start-up companies around the world, with allocation of large investments in additional geological explorations and technology development. At the same time, the supply difficulties enforced the downstream users of REEs to invest in the development of recycling technologies and reuse options for these elements.The main focus of this paper is to overview existing and emerging REE supply chains outside of China up to date (end of 2013), define their environmental constraints and opportunities, as well as reflect on a broader range of technical, economic, and social challenges for both primary production and recycling of REEs. A better understanding of these factors could help to optimize the supply chain of virgin and recycled rare earths, minimise the environmental impacts arising from their processing, and be used as a prototype for a broader range of critical metals and commodities."

This chapter synthesizes recent studies concerning developmental differences in how children understand the technical and social complexity of the Internet. As part of this synthesis, we highlight the contributions of age, and direct and indirect online experience using the Internet. We also highlight that although understanding of the Internet's technical and social complexity improves with age, older adolescents and adults still show, for the most part, an incorrect understanding of the Internet. Possible explanations for this observation are explored, including the limited availability of internal and external resources that would lead to development of that understanding."

A BEM for band structure and elastic wave transmission analysis of 2D phononic crystals with different interface conditions,"Feng-Lian Li, Yue-Sheng Wang, Chuanzeng Zhang, ","International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, Volume 144, August 2018, Pages 110-117, ","In this paper, a boundary element method (BEM) is developed and applied to compute the band structures and the elastic wave transmission of 2D phononic crystals which have different interface conditions between the scatterers and the matrix. The 2D phononic crystals consist of circular or square solid cylinders periodically embedded in a solid matrix forming a square lattice. For a periodic unit-cell, the boundary integral equations for both the scatterer and the matrix are formulated. After discretizing the boundary integral equations and for an infinite periodic structure, a linear eigenvalue equation related to the Bloch wave vector is obtained by substituting the periodic boundary conditions and the interface conditions. While for the corresponding semi-infinite periodic structure, a linear equation set is obtained from which the elastic wave transmission can be obtained. To verify the present BEM, some representative numerical examples are presented for the phononic crystals with different acoustic impedance ratios. The numerical results indicate that the present BEM can efficiently provide accurate results for phononic crystals with arbitrary shapes and different interface conditions, and the interface conditions have important effects on the band structures and the elastic wave transmission.Download high-res image (133KB)Download full-size image"

A hybrid approach of mobile malware detection in Android,"Fei Tong, Zheng Yan, ","Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, Volume 103, May 2017, Pages 22-31, ","Android security incidents occurred frequently in recent years. This motivates us to study mobile app security, especially in Android open mobile operating system. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach for mobile malware detection by adopting both dynamic analysis and static analysis. We collect execution data of sample malware and benign apps using a net_link technology to generate patterns of system calls related to file and network access. Furthermore, we build up a malicious pattern set and a normal pattern set by comparing the patterns of malware and benign apps with each other. For detecting an unknown app, we use a dynamic method to collect its system calling data. We then compare them with both the malicious and normal pattern sets offline in order to judge the unknown app. Based on the test on a set of mobile malware and benign apps, we found that our approach achieves better detection success rate than some methods using either static analysis or dynamic analysis. What is more, the proposed approach is generic, which can detect different types of malware effectively. Its detection accuracy can be further improved since the pattern sets can be automatically optimized through self-learning."

The purpose is to apply this technique for untreated and hyperthermia-treated experimental choroidal melanoma. MS 325 was used as new intravascular albumin-bound gadolinium-based contrast agent. Pigmented choroidal melanomas were established in albino rabbits. MRI was performed in 7 untreated eyes and 7 eyes treated with a Neodymium:Yttrium-Lanthanum-Fluoride-laser at 1047 nm. 3D-spoiled gradient echo pulse sequences were used to acquire T＊ weighted axial images. First, a set of images was collected without contrast agent. MS 325 was then injected i.v. and images were obtained within 12 min after injection. Signal intensities were measured within tumor, ciliary body, choroid, and iris and relative signal intensities were determined for these tissues in relation to vitreous. In untreated tumors, the relative signal intensity was higher after injection of MS 325 (5.61+0.70) than without MS 325 (2.90+0.33; p = 0.0002). In contrast, the relative signal intensity of treated tumors did not differ significantly before and after MS 325 (6.19+1.59 and 6.13+1.64). Histopathological sections indicated vascular occlusion in treated tumors. All other studied tissues of untreated and treated eyes showed a significant increase of relative signal intensities in the presence of MS 325. An animal model for the research on contrast agents in MRI is presented. Blood volume measurement with MS 325 was adapted for experimental choroidal melanomas. Reduced change of relative signal intensity indicates compromised blood volume after vascular occlusion in hyperthermia-treated melanoma.

A novel scheme of anonymous authentication on trust in Pervasive Social Networking,"Zheng Yan, Pu Wang, Wei Feng, ","Information Sciences, Volumes 445每446, June 2018, Pages 79-96, ","Pervasive Social Networking (PSN) supports various social activities at any time and in any places with the heterogeneous networks. Trust plays a crucial role in securing PSN. Authenticating trust anonymously is becoming an attractive approach to ensuring trustworthy and privacy-preserving social networking. However, the literature still lacks serious studies on this topic, especially for PSN systems. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to authenticate PSN node trust in an anonymous and semi-distributed manner. The scheme allows one or multiple Authorized Parties (APs) to announce up-to-date aggregate lists of Integrated Node Trust (INT) for certificateless authenticating trust with anonymity, unforgeability, unlinkability and conditional traceability. In addition, multiple APs can cooperate to flexibly conduct trust authentication without significantly increasing computational overhead. Aggregate signature verification further improves scheme efficiency. Security proof, performance analysis and evaluation show that our scheme is effective with regard to security, privacy preservation, computational complexity, communication cost, efficiency, scalability and flexibility."
[15] Computational and experimental approaches to studying metal interactions with microbial biofilms,"D. Scott Smith, F.

Methods to determine metal binding to natural sorbents, such as minerals, organic matter, and bacteria, have been developed, and similar methods would apply for the mixed system that makes up a biofilm. In order to simplify the theoretical framework for modeling metal每biofilm interactions, it is useful to start with the assumption that the system can be explained with an equilibrium description. In addition, if additivity is assumed, then results for individual systems can be combined to obtain an overall description of biofilm binding. This approach permits fitting of experimental data to a variety of mathematical models from which predictive parameters, such as K, may be extracted. The chapter also discusses the limits and advantages of the techniques. A consideration of the limits of applying the additivity assumption to investigate total binding in biofilms is presented."
Farmer innovation system and government intervention: An empirical study of straw utilisation technology development and diffusion in China,"Liyan Zhang, Bin Wu, ","Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 188, 1 July 2018, Pages 698-707, ","In the context of rural sustainability in the developing world, a dilemma facing government intervention is to recognise and properly use local (or indigenous, practical) knowledge. This paper sheds new light on government intervention by introducing a farmer innovation system (FIS), which is initiated by farmer innovator(s) with participation or support from government agencies and other stakeholders for technology improvement and diffusion. In relation to different understandings, attitudes and approaches to farmer innovation, we argue that different government intervention may lead to different project designs and results. The complexity of government intervention in farmer innovation can be seen from an empirical study of the development and diffusion of straw utilisation technology (SUT) in rural China. By analysing and comparing two cases - one successful and one failed - we reveal two types of government intervention, and features and conditions of project success. The major limitation is identified as leaving out other actors such as local business partners and non-government agencies. We suggest a balanced account between farmer innovator(s), government intervention and innovation platform in future research."
Galactoside-binding lectin in Solen grandis as a pattern recognition receptor mediating opsonization,"Tianyu Zhao, Xiumei Wei, Jialong Yang, Sheng Wang, Yu Zhang, ","Fish & Shellfish Immunology, Volume 82, November 2018, Pages 183-189, ","Galactoside-binding lectin (galectin) is a type of pathogen recognition molecule that occupies an important position in the invertebrate innate immunity system. Our previous study has identified a galectin gene in mollusk Solen grandis (SgGal-1) and illustrated its potential roles in innate immunity. By the functional study using recombinant protein and specific antibody, here, we confirmed the pivotal roles of SgGal-1 in immune defense of S. grandis. SgGal-1 protein was expressed in many tested tissues including gill, mantle, hepatopancreas and gonad, except hemocytes and muscle. The recombinant SgGal-1 (rSgGal-1) bound PGN and 汕-glucan instead of LPS in vitro, and it further caused significant agglutination of five different microbes, suggesting SgGal-1 served as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) involved in immune defense of mollusk. Furthermore, SgGal-1 recruited hemocytes to encapsulate, which was blocked by anti-rSgGal-1 serum. In the meantime, rSgGal-1 as well as promoted the phagocytosis of hemocytes against Escherichia coli in vitro. All these results suggested that SgGal-1 in S. grandis not only acted as a PRR recognizing microbes but also directly participated in the process of immune opsonization to protect the host from pathogenic infection."

"Police custody deaths in Maryland, USA: An examination of 45 cases","Pamela Southall, Jami Grant, David Fowler, Shauna Scott, ","Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine, Volume 15, Issue 4, May 2008, Pages 227-230, ","Previous published research suggests there are a diverse, yet relatively consistent, set of factors present in sudden, unexpected, and initially inexplicable deaths in police custody. This retrospective analysis examines police custodial deaths in Maryland, USA. Police custody death is operationalized to include deaths which occurred suddenly and unexpectedly during police/citizen encounters. Only deaths for which the cause was initially undeterminable are included. Suicidal hanging, police shootings and fatal pursuits are not included. Review of the records at Maryland＊s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner indicates that 45 persons died suddenly and unexpectedly in the custody of the police, between 1990 and 2004. Commensurate with existing research, our analysis identifies multiple factors generally present in this type of police custody death. Although individual-specific, these factors include a relatively static constellation of behavioral (e.g., erratic and/or violent behavior, and physical struggle) and physical (e.g., stimulant abuse, natural disease, and obesity) dimensions. While the presence of these factors has been well-documented, their empirical significance, interactions and causal sequence have yet to be established. To increase the methodological rigor of subsequent research, we have developed a comprehensive, national custody death database by which multivariate models may be analyzed."
Restoration of aspartoacylase activity in CNS neurons does not ameliorate motor deficits and demyelination in a model of Canavan disease,"Matthias Klugmann, Claudia B. Leichtlein, C. Wymond Symes, Tadao Serikawa, Matthew J. During, ","Molecular Therapy, Volume 11, Issue 5, May 2005, Pages 745-753, ","Canavan disease is an early onset leukodystrophy associated with psychomotor retardation, seizures, and premature death. This disorder is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA). Normally, ASPA is enriched in oligodendrocytes and ASPA deficiency results in elevated levels of its substrate molecule, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), brain edema, and dysmyelination. Using adeno-associated virus, we permanently expressed ASPA in CNS neurons of the tremor rat, a genetic model of Canavan disease, and examined the efficacy of the treatment by monitoring NAA metabolism, myelination, motor behavior, and seizures. Assessment of ASPA protein and enzyme activity in whole brain hemispheres showed restoration to normal levels as long as 6 months after treatment. This finding correlated with a reduction of NAA levels, along with a rescue of the seizure phenotype. However, gross brain pathology, such as dilated ventricles and spongiform vacuolization, was unchanged. Moreover, hypomyelination and motor deficits were not resolved by ASPA gene transfer. Our data suggest that NAA-mediated neuronal hyperexcitation but not oligodendrocyte dysfunction can be compensated for by neuronal ASPA expression."
Adaptive multi-cue based particle swarm optimization guided particle filter tracking in infrared videos,"Miaohui Zhang, Ming Xin, Jie Yang, ","Neurocomputing, Volume 122, 25 December 2013, Pages 163-171, ","This paper presents a multi-cue based particle swarm optimization (PSO) guided particle filter (PF) tracking framework. In the proposed tracking framework, PSO is incorporated into the probabilistic framework of PF as an optimization scheme for the propagation of particles, which can make particles move toward the high likelihood area to find the optimal position in the state transition stage, and simultaneously the newest observations are utilized to update the relocated particles in the update stage. Furthermore, likelihood measure functions employing multi-cue are explored to improve the robustness and accuracy of tracking. Here, each cue weight is self-adaptively adjusted by PSO algorithm throughout the tracking process. Experiments performed on several challenging public infrared video sequences demonstrate that our proposed tracking approach achieves considerable performances."

Y Young, ","Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Volume 22, Issue 6, July 2004, Pages 779-787, ","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a new intravascular contrast agent, monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles (MION), was applied to assess the effect of transpupillary thermotherapy in a rabbit model of choroidal melanoma. 3D-spoiled gradient recalled sequences were used for quantitative assessment of blood volume. The MRI-parameters were 5/22/35∼ (time of repetition (TR)/echo delay (TE)/flip angle (FA)) for T1- and 50/61/10∼ for T2-weighted sequences. Images were collected before and at different times after MION injection. In all untreated tissues studied, MION reduced the T2-weighted signal intensity within 0.5 h and at 24 h (all p ≒ 0.012), whereas no significant changes were detected in treated tumors. T1-weighted images also revealed differences of MION-related signal changes between treated tumors and other tissues, yet at lower sensitivity and specificity than T2. The change of T2-weighted MRI signal caused by intravascular MION allows early distinction of laser-treated experimental melanomas from untreated tissues. Further study is necessary to determine whether MRI can localize areas of tumor regrowth within tumors treated incompletely."
Probabilistic load flow calculation with quasi-Monte Carlo and multiple linear regression,"Xiaoyuan Xu, Zheng Yan, ","International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems, Volume 88, June 2017, Pages 1-12, ","In this paper, quasi-Monte Carlo combined with multiple linear regression (QMC-MLR) is proposed to solve probabilistic load flow (PLF) calculation. A distinguishing feature of the paper is that PLF is approached by a low-dimensional problem with the concept of the effective dimension, and thus QMC based on low-discrepancy sequences is used to improve the sampling efficiency of the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Moreover, according to the relationship between linear correlation and linear regression, the MLR-based correlation control technique is developed to arrange the orders of samples in order to introduce prescribed dependences between variables. The proposed method is tested with the IEEE 118-bus system. Simulation results indicate that the MLR-based technique is robust and efficient in handling correlated non-normal variables and the proposed method shows better performances in PLF calculation compared with other MCS techniques, including simple random sampling (SRS), Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and Latin supercube sampling (LSS)."
CloudFile: A cloud data access control system based on mobile social trust,"Zheng Yan, Wangyang Shi, ","Journal of Network and Computer Applications, Volume 86, 15 May 2017, Pages 46-58, ","Personal data management at cloud with mobile devices confronts a number of practical challenges such as security, efficiency and usability. Many existing solutions suffer from high computation and communication costs, thus impractical to be deployed in mobile domains. Notably, high popularity of mobile social networking provides a good platform to assess social trust in a pervasive way, which can be applied to automatically manage personal data access at the cloud with sound performance and effectiveness. This paper presents the design and implementation of a personal cloud data access control system named CloudFile based on trust evaluation in mobile social networking. The CloudFile uses a Key Policy每Attribute Based Encryption (KP-ABE) scheme to control personal data access based on social trust in order to guarantee the safety of mobile cloud data storage. System performance tests show that the CloudFile is flexible for controlling data access, secure for personal data storage, and efficient to be deployed by mobile devices. Particularly, we investigate user acceptance on the CloudFile system. Based on user feedback, we conclude that the CloudFile is accepted with regard to perceived ease of use, practicality, user interface, playfulness and intuitive attitude."
Economic benefit of chemical dependency treatment to employers,"Neil Jordan, Grant Grissom, Gregory Alonzo, Laura Dietzen, Scott Sangsland, ","Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, Volume 34, Issue 3, April 2008, Pages 311-319, ","Using assessment data from the Substance Abuse Treatment Support System, we estimated the economic benefit of chemical dependency treatment to employers. A cohort of individuals (N = 498) treated at Kaiser Permanente's Addiction Medicine programs in Southern California completed assessments before and at least 30 days after treatment began. Compared to intake, subsequent assessments indicated substantial reduction in the number of patients who missed work, were late for work, were less productive than usual at work, and/or had conflict with coworkers or management. The net economic value of these improvements to their employers depended upon the utilization rate of the benefit and the salary level of the employees receiving treatment. For a utilization rate of 0.9% and a mean annual salary of US$45,000, the net benefit of treatment was US$1,538 for ≡ 61 days of treatment. Based solely upon these employment-related measures, without factoring in the medical cost offset or indirect benefits of treatment that may help employees to maintain higher levels of productivity, employers break even on an investment of US$30 per member per year for a chemical dependency treatment benefit if the mean annual salary of the employees participating in treatment is US$36,565."
Localization of functional sites on the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein of Sendai virus by sequence analysis of antigenic and temperature-sensitive mutants,"Susan D. Thompson, Allen Portneri, ","Virology, Volume 160, Issue 1, September 1987, Pages 1-8, ","To locate the various functions associated with the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein of Sendai virus in the primary structure of the protein, a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant and seven antigenic mutants were sequenced. The ts mutant was defective in its ability to agglutinate erythrocytes and infect host cells, while its neuraminidase activity was normal. Its sequence revealed two closely spaced amino acid substitutions (residues 262 and 264) and one distant substitution (residue 461). Revertants could not be isolated, suggesting that more than one of the substitutions is responsible for the defective hemagglutinating activity. The antigenic mutants were selected with monoclonal antibodies that delineate four nonoverlapping antigenic sites (I每IV) and separately inhibit hemagglutinating, neuraminidase, and hemolysis activities. Mutants selected with antibodies to antigenic sites I每III were used to map these functions on the primary sequence of HN. Each antigenic mutant had a single point mutation in the HN gene that resulted in an amino acid substitution in the protein. A site II mutant selected with an antibody which inhibits hemolysin activity had a substitution at amino acid 420, while a mutant selected with antibody that inhibits only erythrocyte binding (site III) had a substitution at amino acid 541. Two antigenic mutants selected with an antibody that inhibits hemagglutination and neuraminidase activities (site I) had amino acid substitutions in close proximity (residues 277 and 279) to the two closely spaced substitutions of the is mutant. These findings suggest that the region defined by the ts mutant and these two antigenic mutants is involved in host cell binding. Antigenic mutants selected with another site I antibody had amino acid changes at residue 184, indicating that antigenic site I is discontinuous in the primary sequence. This antibody blocks only hemagglutination, but mutants selected with it had a decreased neuraminidase activity. This finding supports the idea that the neuraminidase site is close to, but distinct from, the hemagglutination site."

Of the 810.6 million ED visits during the 8-year study period, an estimated 11.4 million (1.41%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30每1.52) had an LBBS disposition. The number and proportion of LBBS visits have increased over time, from 1.1 million visits in 1995 (1.15%, 95% CI 0.95每1.35) to 2.1 million visits in 2002 (1.92%, 95% CI 1.67每2.17). LBBS patients were more likely to be younger, non-White, Hispanic, urban, and uninsured compared to non-LBBS patients. The number and proportion of LBBS visits have increased over time. LBBS visits disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. These findings suggest that recent strains on the US ED system are adversely affecting healthcare quality and access."
Nonlinear optimal control of spacecraft approaching a tumbling target,"Ming Xin, Hejia Pan, ","Aerospace Science and Technology, Volume 15, Issue 2, March 2011, Pages 79-89, ","This paper investigates the control of spacecraft to approach to and align with a tumbling target. The potential application is to perform on-orbit autonomous satellite servicing. In order to complete the task, the spacecraft is required to perform large position and attitude maneuvers with sufficient accuracy. In addition, the flexible motion induced by large angular maneuvers needs to be minimized. The primary contribution of this work is to consider the control of position and attitude of rigid body and suppression of flexural deformation in one optimal control framework. The 6-DOF rigid body dynamics and coupled flexible structure dynamics are highly nonlinear and lead to a challenging control problem. The 牟每D nonlinear optimal control technique is employed to design a closed-form feedback controller for this problem by finding an approximate solution to the Hamilton每Jacobi每Bellman (HJB) equation through a perturbation process. The closed-form controller offered by this approach is easy to implement onboard especially for this problem with a large state-space. Numerical results show that the proposed controller exhibits good tracking performance even under large moment of inertia uncertainties."
New insights into diabetic retinopathy by OCT angiography,"Guodong Liu, Ding Xu, Fang Wang, ","Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, Volume 142, August 2018, Pages 243-253, ","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common diabetic complications, which has become a leading cause for vision loss, mainly because of macular edema and vitreous hemorrhage. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography is a novel technique to visualize vascular changes including microaneurysm, non-perfusion area, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities, and neovascularization. Recently, it is possible to quantify vascular density, foveal avascular zone area, non-perfusion area objectively using OCT angiography. In addition, OCT angiography also provides an alternative method to evaluate the effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments by providing high resolution images of macular microcirculatory abnormalities. Thus OCT angiography is an effective method to investigate the vascular changes of the disease, and can also be potentially applied in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow up of DR."
Effects of nonionic surfactant and salts on the interactions between oppositely charged star-shaped copolymer and ionic surfactant in aqueous solutions,"Yi Guo, Jingwen Shen, Meng Li, Yazhuo Shang, Honglai Liu, ","Journal of Molecular Liquids, Volume 266, 15 September 2018, Pages 789-796, ","The interaction between star-shaped copolymer poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate-b-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl methacrylate) (CDPDPM) and anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in aqueous solutions are investigated by using fluorescence and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques. The effects of nonionic surfactant dodecyl 汕-D-maltopyranoside (C12G2) and salts including inorganic salt ammonium bromide (NH4Br) and organic salt tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (Bu4NBr) on the interaction between CDPDPM and SDS have been explored systematically. The results have suggested that SDS molecules can bind on CDPDPM by electrostatic interaction between the positively charged CDPDPM and negatively charged SDS and thus weaken the binding ability of CDPDPM to water molecules. CDPDPM exhibits temperature-responsive aggregation behavior in aqueous solution gradually with the increase of SDS concentration and the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) decreases correspondingly. The introduction of nonionic surfactant C12G2 changes the interaction between CDPDPM and SDS significantly by participate the formation of complexes and the stability of the CDPDPM/SDS complexes declines leading to the chance of forming larger complexes is deprived at higher temperature. The addition of NH4Br to the CDPDPM/SDS system can retard the binding of SDS on the polymer chains because of electrostatic shielding. Correspondingly, LCST is higher and the formed aggregates are smaller. For CDPDPM/Bu4NBr/SDS system, the phenomenon is similar to that of the CDPDPM/C12G2/SDS system. This should be attributed to the nature of Bu4N+, possesses not only positive charges but also certain hydrophobicity, and thus Bu4N+ has the ability to participate and facilitate the formation of SDS micelles. Obviously, the LCST of the mixed system can be tailored by adjusting the system composition on purpose."
TGF3L fusion enhances the antitumor activity of TRAIL by promoting assembly into polymers,"Yan Wang, Qiong Lei, Zheng Yan, Cangjie Shen, Nan Wang, ","Biochemical Pharmacology, Volume 155, September 2018, Pages 510-523, ","TRAIL, a promising antitumor immuno-agent, exerted limited efficacy in clinical trials. The third disulfide loop of TGF-汐 (TGF3L peptide) with a very low affinity for EGFR has been reported to enhance the activity of fused antigens or cytokines. We wondered whether fusion of this peptide could enhance TRAIL activity and what the underlying mechanism for this enhancement would be. The TGF3L-TRAIL showed greatly enhanced cytotoxicity in a variety of cancer cell lines while spared normal cells unharmed. Typical apoptosis and cellular caspase activation were potently induced by TGF3L-TRAIL at the concentration levels corresponding to its cytotoxicity. TGF3L-TRAIL was able to activate both DR4 and DR5 the same as TRAIL did. It induced complete cell death in Colo205 through only one receptor when the other one was blocked, different from TRAIL-induced cell death (through DR4 dominantly). TGF3L-TRAIL cytotoxicity was not reduced in some cell lines even if both receptors are blocked simultaneously. Surprisingly, TGF3L-TRAIL self-assembled into stable polymers, which was responsible for its enhanced cytotoxicity. In human tumor xenograft mouse models, TGF3L-TRAIL showed anti-tumor activity similar to or better than TRAIL in different cancer cell types, consistent with its differing enhancement of cytotoxicity in vitro. Taken together, TGF3L fusion of TRAIL obviously enhances the anticancer activity of TRAIL by promoting assembly into polymers, which presents a novel fusion strategy for improving TRAIL function.Download high-res image (94KB)Download full-size image"

Expression of exon 1 of mutant htt containing 70 CAG repeats rapidly led to neuropathological features associated with HD. In addition, we report novel data relating to neuronal transduction of AAV vectors that modulated the phenotype observed in this model. Quantitative reverse transcriptase每polymerase chain reaction (RT每PCR) revealed that AAV vector每mediated expression in the striatum increased by >100-fold as compared to the endogenous htt level. Moreover, AAV vectors exhibited nonuniform transduction patterns in striatal neuronal populations, as well as axonal transport leading to transduction and neuronal cell death in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra (SN). These findings may inform future studies that utilize AAV vectors for neurodegenerative disease modeling. Further, RNA interference (RNAi) of mutant htt expression mediated by virus vector delivery of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) ameliorates early-stage disease phenotypes in transgenic mouse models of HD. However, it has not been reported whether shRNA-mediated knockdown of mutant htt expression is neuroprotective. AAV-shRNA was shown to mediate a dramatic knockdown of HD70 expression, preventing striatal neurodegeneration and concomitant motor behavioral impairment. These results provide further support for the use of AAV vector每mediated RNAi as a therapeutic strategy for HD."
A survey on game theoretical methods in Human每Machine Networks,"Xueqin Liang, Zheng Yan, ","Future Generation Computer Systems, In press, corrected proof, Available online 7 November 2017, ","A number of information and resource sharing systems arise and become popular with the rapid development of communication technologies and mobile smart devices.

Determination of effective diffusivities and convective coefficients of pure gases in single pellets,"Weiruo Sun, Carlos A. V. Costa, Al赤rio E. Rodrigues, ","The Chemical Engineering Journal and the Biochemical Engineering Journal, Volume 57, Issue 3, May 1995, Pages 285-294, ","The determination of the effective diffusivities and convective coefficients of pure component gases in single porous pellets can be done separately using the diffusion-convection cell experimental technique; this simplifies the experimental procedure and the theoretical exploitation of the experimental results and improves the precision of parameter estimation. The validity of the assumption of perfect mixing inside the chambers and negligible film diffusion resistance was confirmed by a blank chamber test and by comparison of the responses obtained using the possible maximum and minimum film diffusion resistances respectively. The effective intrapellet diffusivities are determined by fitting the theoretical response of both chambers to the experimental values for a tracer gas stream. The dead-end pore volume can be evaluated from the results obtained using the steady and the transient responses. The effective convective coefficients were obtained from the top and bottom chamber inlet and outlet flow rates for a pure component stream keeping a given pressure difference across the pellet. For pellets with large average pore diameter, the experimental effective convective coefficients are independent of the average pressure. For pellets with small average pore diameter, the experimental apparent convective coefficients strongly depend on the average pressure. This dependence is expected since for small pores the contribution of non-convective fluxes to the total flux may become important. The intrapellet effective diffusivities and the effective convective coefficients were determined at 40, 70 and 95 ∼C for five single pellets of alumina based catalyst supports using helium as carrier gas and argon, oxygen and nitrogen as tracers."

How these genomic changes could further influence host health is still unclear. In this work, the alterations of gut-microbiota dependent metabolites were studied in the GTP-treated rats. Six groups of female SD rats (n=12/group) were administered drinking water containing 0%, 0.5%, and 1.5% GTP (wt/vol). Their gut contents were collected at 3- and 6-month and were analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS). GC每MS based metabolomics analysis captured 2668 feature, and 57 metabolites were imputatively from top 200 differential features identified via NIST fragmentation database. A group of key metabolites were quantitated using standard calibration methods. Compared with control, the elevated components in the GTP-treated groups include niacin (8.61-fold), 3-phenyllactic acid (2.20-fold), galactose (3.13-fold), mannose (2.05-fold), pentadecanoic acid (2.15-fold), lactic acid (2.70-fold), and proline (2.15-fold); the reduced components include cholesterol (0.29-fold), cholic acid (0.62-fold), deoxycholic acid (0.41-fold), trehalose (0.14-fold), glucose (0.46-fold), fructose (0.12-fold), and alanine (0.61-fold). These results were in line with the genomic alterations of gut-microbiome previously discovered by metagenomics analysis. The alterations of these metabolites suggested the reduction of calorific carbohydrates, elevation of vitamin production, decreases of bile constituents, and modified metabolic pattern of amino acids in the GTP-treated animals. Changes in gut-microbiota associated metabolism may be a major contributor to the anti-obesity function of GTP."

"Inhibition of Neutrophil Superoxide Generation by Hypericin, an Antiretroviral Agent","Toshifumi Nishiuchi, Takahiko Utsumi, Tomoko Kanno, Yoshiki Takehara, Kozo Utsumi, ","Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Volume 323, Issue 2, 10 November 1995, Pages 335-342, ","We previously reported that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced superoxide[formula]generation of neutrophils was inhibited by hypericin, a photosensitizing pigment found in St. Johnswort (herbHypericin triquetrifoliumTurra), via a mechanism involving protein kinase C (PKC). To obtain further insights into the mechanism of inhibition, the effects of hypericin on stimulation-dependent[formula]generation and related enzymes of neutrophils were investigated. Hypericin inhibited[formula]generation of neutrophils induced by PKC-dependent and -independent stimuli in a light- and concentration-dependent manner. Oxygen was required for the light-dependent inhibition by hypericin. NADPH oxidase activity in a cell-free system and TNF-汐-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of neutrophil proteins were also inhibited by hypericin in a concentration- and light-dependent manner. However, tyrosine kinase of p60src, an enzyme not bound to a membrane, was not inhibited either in the light or in the dark. Oxygen uptake of neutrophils by photosensitization with hypericin resulted in the formation of singlet oxygen (1O2),[formula], and hydroxyl radical (﹞OH) and enhanced lipid peroxidation. The formation of1O2was inhibited by azide, a quencher of1O2, but not by desferrioxamine (DSF), a ferric ion chelator. By contrast, both generation of ﹞OH and lipid peroxidation were inhibited by DSF but not by azide. Furthermore, PMA-induced[formula]generation inhibited by hypericin partially recovered in the presence of azide but not DSF. These results suggested that the light-dependent inhibition of[formula]generation by hypericin might be due to inhibition of tyrosine kinase, PKC, and NADPH oxidase via an oxygen-dependent mechanism, possibly through both Type I and II photosensitization mechanisms."

Freed, Chun-Ting Lee, ","Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Volume 482, Issue 2, 8 January 2017, Pages 282-288, ","Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is considered to be the primary defect involved in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite transcriptome studies in limited T2DM human subjects suggesting an association of T2DM with impaired oxidative phosphorylation in muscle, its molecular pathogenesis remains largely unknown. To identify dysregulated genes and gene networks that are associated with T2DM in human skeletal muscle, we examined expression patterns of 56,318 transcribed genes on 92 T2DM cases and 184 gender-, age- and race-matched non-diabetic controls from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. RNA-Sequencing data suggest that diabetic skeletal muscle is characterized by decreased expression of genes that are related to insulin resistance (IRS2, MTOR, SLC2A4, and PPARA), carbohydrate, energy, and amino acid metabolism pathways (NDUFS1, NDUFA10, NDUFB4, NDUFB5, NDUFA5, NDUFB10, SDHB, SDHC, ATP5H, ATP5A, and ATP5J). Up-regulated genes in T2DM are mainly enriched in apoptosis pathways (TP53, GADD45A, TNFRSF10B, TP53AIP1, and PMAIP1), and notably include immune-related pathways suggestive of a response to various infectious diseases (C2, CFB, C4A, C4B, C1S, C1R, C3, HLA-DRA, HLA-DMA, HLA-DOA, and HLA-DPB1). These results confirm the essential regulation of impaired insulin signaling and oxidative phosphorylation in the muscle of T2DM patients, and provide novel molecular insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM."
Role of frontal white matter and corpus callosum on social function in schizophrenia,"Daisuke Koshiyama, Masaki Fukunaga, Naohiro Okada, Kentaro Morita, Ryota Hashimoto, ","Schizophrenia Research, In press, corrected proof, Available online 10 July 2018, ","Patients with schizophrenia show severe impairment in social function and have difficulty in their daily social life. Although a recent large-scale multicenter study revealed alterations in white matter microstructures, the association between these anatomical changes and social dysfunction in schizophrenia remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated the association between the white matter integrity of regions of interest and social function in schizophrenia. A total of 149 patients with schizophrenia and 602 healthy comparison subjects (HCS) underwent DTI and completed the Picture Arrangement subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition and the Finance subscale of the University of California, San Diego, Performance-Based Skills Assessment Brief, as social indices of interest. The fractional anisotropy (FA) in the anterior corona radiata and corpus callosum was significantly lower in patients than in HCS, and the radial diffusivity (RD) in the anterior corona radiata and corpus callosum was significantly higher in patients. The Picture Arrangement and Finance scores were both significantly impaired in patients. The effect of the FA of the right anterior corona radiata on the Finance score and the Picture Arrangement score, of the RD of the right anterior corona radiata on the Picture Arrangement score, and of the RD of the corpus callosum on the Picture Arrangement score were significant. In conclusion, our results confirmed the association between structural connectivity in the right frontal white matter and corpus callosum and social function in schizophrenia. These findings may provide a foundation for developing an intervention for functional recovery in schizophrenia."
Quantitative characterization of porosity and determination of elastic modulus for sintered micro-silver joints,"James Carr, Xavier Milhet, Pascal Gadaud, Severine A. E. Boyer, Peter Lee, ","Journal of Materials Processing Technology, Volume 225, November 2015, Pages 19-23, ","High resolution serial block-face scanning electron microscopy has been performed on sintered micro-silver pastes that are used as lead replacement joints for die bonding. The size and spatial distributions of the porosity before and after ageing were determined by quantification of the segmented 3D images. The elastic modulus was determined by an image-based finite element model and validated by results obtained from a dynamical resonance method. In agreement with contemporary analytical models on the elastic behaviour of porous materials, the elastic modulus was found to be a function of pore fraction only.

Flexibility and Design: Conformational Heterogeneity along the Evolutionary Trajectory of a Redesigned Ubiquitin,"Justin T. Biel, Michael C. Thompson, Christian N. Cunningham, Jacob E. Corn, James S. Fraser, ","Structure, Volume 25, Issue 5, 2 May 2017, Pages 739-749.e3, ","Although protein design has been used to introduce new functions, designed variants generally only function as well as natural proteins after rounds of laboratory evolution. One possibility for this pattern is that designed mutants frequently sample nonfunctional conformations. To test this idea, we exploited advances in multiconformer modeling of room-temperature X-ray data collection on redesigned ubiquitin variants selected for increasing binding affinity to the deubiquitinase USP7. Initial core mutations disrupt natural packing and lead to increased flexibility. Additional, experimentally selected mutations quenched conformational heterogeneity through new stabilizing interactions. Stabilizing interactions, such as cation-pi stacking and ordered waters, which are not included in standard protein design energy functions, can create specific interactions that have long-range effects on flexibility across the protein. Our results suggest that increasing flexibility may be a useful strategy to escape local minima during initial directed evolution and protein design steps when creating new functions.Download high-res image (135KB)Download full-size image"
A multi-objective optimal PID control for a nonlinear system with time delay,"Furui Xiong, Zhichang Qin, Carlos Hern芍ndez, Yousef Sardahi, Jianqiao Sun, ","Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Letters, Volume 3, Issue 6, 2013, Article 063006, ","It is generally difficult to design feedback controls of nonlinear systems with time delay to meet time domain specifications such as rise time, overshoot, and tracking error. Furthermore, these time domain specifications tend to be conflicting to each other to make the control design even more challenging. This paper presents a cell mapping method for multi-objective optimal feedback control design in time domain for a nonlinear Duffing system with time delay. We first review the multi-objective optimization problem and its formulation for control design. We then introduce the cell mapping method and a hybrid algorithm for global optimal solutions. Numerical simulations of the PID control are presented to show the features of the multi-objective optimal design."

In particular, information related to the resources and capabilities of biologics firms is considered highly confidential and is not accessible to the public. This study investigated five of the top ten biologics firms in the Asia每Pacific region. The firms were examined from the `perspective of dynamic capabilities. More specifically, the dynamic capabilities of the firms were explored using a four-stage coding analysis based on grounded theory. A theoretical framework and relevant concepts and theoretical propositions were developed in this study. Thus, this study proposes a conceptual framework that consists of uncommon knowledge, knowledge network, interaction factors, and mobility capability and describes five theoretical propositions and their influence on market competitiveness. This study found that the complex and dynamic market environment in question is driven by dynamic relations among various interaction factors."
Probabilistic Concept Formation in Relational Domains,"John A. Allen, Kevin Thompson, ","Machine Learning Proceedings 1991, 1991, Pages 375-379, ","This chapter describes COBWEBR＊ s representation of objects and concepts along with its organization of concepts in memory. COBWEBR is based on Fisher's (1987) C O B W E B system, an incremental conceptual clustering algorithm that uses an attribute-value language to represent its instances and concepts. The two systems are consequently similar in both structure and control. COBWEBR classifies instances described in a relational language, that is, each instance is a set of ground literals. COBWEBR represents concepts by storing an associated set of features, which correspond to the literals of the input language. The features are variabilized to allow them to record the relational structure of the instances without being bound to the particular objects being related. Associated with each feature is a conditional probability of occurrence, called the confirmed count, and a conditional probability of nonoccurrence, called the missing count. The concepts in the hierarchy are partially-ordered by generality. Each internal node contains all of the features of its children, storing them in such a way as to reflect the amount of overlap in their relational structures. If several of the children have a feature that can be consistently unified, that feature in the parent will have a high confirmed conditional probability."

Fatigue crack propagation prediction for marine structures based on a spectral method,"Yongkuang Zhang, Xiaoping Huang, Fang Wang, ","Ocean Engineering, Volume 163, 1 September 2018, Pages 706-717, ","A method based on spectrum analysis is proposed for predicting fatigue crack propagation (FCP) of a crack in marine structures. The stress intensity factors (SIF) for a crack can be different under different load cases, such as loading conditions, heading angles and wave frequencies, even at the same level of nominal or hotspot stress. Therefore, the load spectrum obtained from the stress transfer function and wave spectrum may be failing to calculate the FCP accurately. In current study, SIF transfer functions were evaluated through detailed structural analysis for different crack sizes, and the short term SIF distribution obtained from the SIF transfer function. FCP life could then be calculated from numerous short term SIF distribution and the improved Paris formula. A sub-model technique was integrated, facilitating SIF re-analysis due to crack growth, and an Improved Euler method was adopted to reduce the computational steps. FCP of a semi elliptical surface crack at the weld toe between hatch coaming and forward bulkhead of a container ship superstructure was used to demonstrate the application of the proposed spectral method. This paper offers a way of combining the spectral analysis and fracture mechanics in fatigue crack growth calculation for marine structures."

Finally the utility of the proposed method is illuminated by an example."

Although puncture site and advanced age have been reported to increase the risk of ADP, all related factors have not been fully investigated. We retrospectively investigated factors related to ADP in patients undergoing surgery.We reviewed the records of 4107 patients who received epidural anesthesia or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia from April 2010 to March 2013 at our institution. We defined ADP as cases in which cerebrospinal fluid was obviously discharged during puncture and excluded cases in which the epidural catheter was suspected to be inserted into subarachnoid space. We investigated patient background including age, sex, height, body weight, body mass index, vertebral level of puncture site, and presence of ADP, with Student t test, a 聿2 test, and multivariable logistic regression analysis used for statistical tests and significance set at P < .05.Twenty (0.49%) of our patients had ADP. Factors significantly associated were punctures in the 10th-12th thoracic intervertebral (P = .01; odds ratio [OR], 5.19; 95% confidential interval [95% CI], 1.41-19.14) and first to third lumbar intervertebral (P = .03; OR, 5.45; 95% CI, 1.23-24.12) spaces and age (per 1-year increase, P < .01; OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07).Accidental dural puncture occurred in 0.49% of all surgical patients undergoing epidural anesthesia and was significantly related to those who received a puncture in lower thoracic and lumbar intervertebral spaces, whereas age was also an independent factor."

Exploring cognitive bias in destination therapy left ventricular assist device decision making: A retrospective qualitative framework analysis,"Molly Magid, Colleen K. McIlvennan, Jaqueline Jones, Carolyn T. Nowels, Dan Matlock, ","American Heart Journal, Volume 180, October 2016, Pages 64-73, ","Cognitive biases are psychological influences, which cause humans to make decisions, which do not seemingly maximize utility. For people with heart failure, the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a surgically implantable device with complex tradeoffs. As such, it represents an excellent model within which to explore cognitive bias in a real-world decision. We conducted a framework analysis to examine for evidence of cognitive bias among people deciding whether or not to get an LVAD.The aim of this study was to explore the influence of cognitive bias on the LVAD decision-making process.We analyzed previously conducted interviews of patients who had either accepted or declined an LVAD using a deductive, predetermined framework of cognitive biases. We coded and analyzed the interviews using an inductive-deductive framework approach, which also allowed for other themes to emerge.We interviewed a total of 22 heart failure patients who had gone through destination therapy LVAD decision making (15 who had accepted the LVAD and 7 who had declined). All patients appeared influenced by state dependence, where both groups described high current state of suffering, but the groups differed in whether they believed LVAD would relieve suffering or not. We found evidence of cognitive bias that appeared to influence decision making in both patient groups, but groups differed in terms of which cognitive biases were present. Among accepters, we found evidence of anchoring bias, availability bias, optimism bias, and affective forecasting. Among decliners, we found evidence of errors in affective forecasting.Medical decision making is often a complicated and multifaceted process that includes cognitive bias as well as other influences. It is important for clinicians to recognize that patients can be affected by cognitive bias, so they can better understand and improve the decision-making process to ensure that patients are fully informed."
Data-driven compensation method for sensor drift faults in digital PID systems with unknown dynamics,"Jun-Sheng Wang, Guang-Hong Yang, ","Journal of Process Control, Volume 65, May 2018, Pages 15-33, ","This paper investigates the problem of compensating for the slow-changing sensor drift failures occurring in digital PID systems with unknown dynamics. It is extremely difficult to ensure the tracking performance of the faulty systems, due to the system models unavailable, the measurements corrupted by the faults, and the impact of the sensor failures propagated under feedback control. Therefore, the existing data-driven fault-tolerant control (FTC) methods are not capable of dealing with the above problem. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art, a novel residual generator structure is devised. Furthermore, its data-driven realization is accomplished, along with the convergence analysis of the proposed closed-loop recursive identification algorithm. On this basis, such failures can be estimated continuously from the residual signals, using an iterative estimation procedure, the convergence of whose mean-square estimation error is theoretically proven. As a result, the effect of the aforementioned failures on the tracking properties is eliminated with the aid of a fault detection mechanism and based on the tracking error signal corrected with the estimated faults. Finally, the effectiveness and merits of the resultant data-driven FTC algorithm are validated by the continuous stirred tank heater benchmark process."
Effect of meteorological conditions on onsite runoff control for reducing the hydrological footprint of green building,"Sheng Wang, Heng Wang, Yujun Deng, ","Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 175, 20 February 2018, Pages 333-342, ","Rainwater management is an essential part of sustainable site of a green building, in which the complexity of meteorological conditions is a difficult problem to deal with. In this study, based on 20 year's daily historical records, five cities were selected to represent rainfall disparity between 50 state capitals of the United States of America. Then, the sites' hydrologic responses to different rainfall conditions were simulated over 30 year's hourly historical records, and the statistics of rainfall/runoff events were plotted into hydrological frequency curves to represent the site hydrology. The difference between different scenarios is reflected by comparing water balance and hydrological frequency curves. The results showed that average daily rainfall depth and average annual rainy days are two conditions with greatest effects on runoff potential. Retaining the 95每99th percentile rainfall event is required as design objectives for three sites to replicate predevelopment runoff characteristics, while even the 99th percentile was not enough for the other two sites, unless impervious cover reduced or the design storm doubled. Onsite runoff control minimized the impact of site development on runoff, but not on infiltration and evaporation. The sites evaporation increased from 1% to 11每36%. Besides, The distance between the obtained runoff frequency curve and the designed counterpart suggested that rainfall retained in situ was less than the design objective because of precipitation concentration, which is worthy of consideration in future research to reduce hydrological footprint of green building more economically and effectively."
Dysfunctional plasmalogen dynamics in the plasma and platelets of patients with schizophrenia,"Paul L. Wood, Greg Unfried, Willard Whitehead, Aaron Phillipps, Julie A.

One such tentative biomarker may be plasmalogens, complex structural glycerophospholipids that serve multiple functions in all cells.To further investigate this possibility, we undertook a lipidomics analysis of choline and ethanolamine plasmalogens in the plasma and platelets of 23 patients with schizophrenia and 27 age-matched controls.Plasma levels of both choline and ethanolamine plasmalogens were decreased by 23 to 45% in patients with schizophrenia. In platelets, from patients with schizophrenia, ethanolamine plasmalogens also were decreased while choline plasmalogen levels were increased. Levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were decreased by approximately 30% both in plasma and platelets.Our results suggest that alterations in lipid transport or lipid remodeling/metabolism of plasmalogens are present in schizophrenia and that changes in the steady-state levels of these complex lipid pools may be involved in altered neuronal function."

The TMS deposition behavior and plasma parameters were examined with discharge time during the deposition process. The chemical composition of TMS plasma polymers was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. It was found that the TMS plasma coatings obtained under such operations have a distinct chemical structure that gradually changes from silicon rich at the interface with the substrate to carbon rich at the top surface. The coating characteristics of TMS plasma polymers were evaluated in terms of refractive index, linear polarization resistance, and adhesion performance to subsequent spray paint primers. Experimental data indicated that DC cathodic polymerization of TMS in a closed reactor system produced plasma coatings with superior-coating properties, such as higher refractive index and stronger primer adhesion, to those obtained in a flow reactor system as employed in parts 1 and 2 of this series. As a result, the plasma interface engineered-coating systems of IVD/plasma polymer/non-chromated primer obtained under such an operation showed excellent corrosion protection of IVD Al-coated Al alloys which outperformed the chromate conversion-coated IVD controls after 4 weeks of SO2 salt spray and 12 weeks of Prohesion salt spray tests."

In this study, low-temperature plasma deposition and treatment has proved to be a powerful approach to engineer the surface and interface of Parylene C coatings. After applying a special plasma polymer coating, which acts as an inter-layer to provide good adhesion to the substrate as well as to the subsequent primer, an excellent adhesion of Parylene C coating to a smooth 7075-T6 aluminum alloy has been achieved. After the surface has been functionalized by plasma treatment, the naturally hydrophobic Parylene polymer became paintable with both solventborne and waterborne spray primers."

Loenneke, ","Medical Hypotheses, Volume 108, October 2017, Pages 63-68, ","Resistance exercise is believed to be important for improving several biomarkers of health and contributing to decreased all-cause mortality. However, a careful examination of the literature reveals a growing body of cross-sectional studies finding stronger associations between strength independent of physical activity on these various outcomes and biomarkers (i.e., C 每 reactive protein, homocysteine, total cholesterol) of health. Considering that engagement in resistance type exercise is associated with an increase in strength, such cross-sectional data is often used to promote engagement in resistance training. When one examines the cross-sectional studies together with the experimental work, however, this relationship becomes less clear. For example, being in a higher tertile or quartile for grip strength may be associated with more favorable biomarkers or health outcomes, yet, experimental work shows that grip strength does not change with traditional resistance exercise. This seems to suggest that our interpretation and application of this literature may be incorrect. It is our opinion that much of the cross-sectional work may more accurately illustrate inherent differences between individuals who are ※weak§ and individuals who are ※strong§. In addition, there is conflicting experimental evidence and a lack of longitudinal support that resistance exercise may have a meaningful effect on long-term health outcomes. Using this evidence, we present our ※human baseline hypothesis§, which proposes that the baseline value of strength that a person possesses prior to training may be a more appropriate indicator regarding long-term health outcomes than the act of training itself."

Two alternative numerical models for ship passing piers problem are compared with the current analysis method. Based on the three numerical models, the characteristics of the hydrodynamic loads acting on the passing ship are specified and the critical positions for the peak values have been identified. Simulation results demonstrate that the fluid disturbance induced by the piers is of importance.

"An institutional approach to manure recycling: Conduit brokerage in Sichuan Province, China","Bettina Bluemling, Fang Wang, ","Resources, Conservation and Recycling, Volume 139, December 2018, Pages 396-406, ","With increases in living standards and dietary changes, the livestock sector has grown rapidly worldwide, which has led to considerable environmental pollution through livestock manure. Particularly in East Asia, meat production has increased fast. While part of the problem can be resolved by further processing manure into commercial organic fertilizer, technological solutions do face their limits in dealing with high pollution loads at farms. There is hence urgent need for policy instruments that could help mitigate environmental pollution. However, not much is known about related policy initiatives. This paper introduces a cooperative in Sichuan Province, China, which connects livestock farms to crop farms that are willing to use livestock breeders＊ manure on their land. As no frameworks exist which could aid the analysis of such a cooperative, we develop a framework based on the concept of ※brokerage§. Our analysis shows that for the case of Qionglai, structural conditions are favourable to the cooperative closing the nutrient cycle by means of brokerage. However, as our analysis shows, constraints to the cooperative＊s effectiveness foremost come from its daily operations. Within the given institutional structure, further qualitative improvements should be undertaken in terms of manure processing and manure management. The application of the framework to manure recycling shows that the framework and brokerage in general are useful analytical concepts for the circular economy. We conclude that the framework could also be applied to other fields of the circular economy, like food waste or bioenergy.Download high-res image (146KB)Download full-size image"

In that time, only limited data have been published relating to their performance, and what does exist relates to laboratory test facilities. This text focuses on the analysis of a large data set obtained from installed siphonic roof drainage systems. Particular attention is given to the ability of the studied systems to prime and meet self-cleansing criteria during sub-design criteria events with return periods of less than one year. Conclusions are drawn regarding the performance characteristics of multi-outlet siphonic roof drainage systems, and plans for future work are outlined."
Biocompatible nanofilm coating by magneto-luminous polymerization of methane,"Hirotsugu Yasuda, Loic Ledernez, Fethi Olcaytug, Gregory Dame, Michael Bergmann, ","Progress in Organic Coatings, Volume 74, Issue 4, August 2012, Pages 667-678, ","Coating is uniquely feasible means to impart biocompatibility to artificial materials to be used in biology and medicine, because a totally different surface-state could be created. However, it is necessary to understand factors that control ※biocompatibility§ first. The examination of molecular level factors involved in interfacial interaction revealed that the best surface-state for biocompatibility should contain no chemical functional group. Such a surface-state cannot be created by conventional chemical means, and application of conventional coating could be used in rather limited cases only. Magneto-luminous polymerization of methane yields nanofilm of amorphous carbon, which seems to be the closest to the ideal non-interacting surface. Fundamental factors involved in interactions of polymer surface with surrounding medium, and mechanisms how magneto-luminous polymerization coating yields amorphous carbon nanofilm, which has the least interfacial interaction capability, are described in this paper."
New insights into aging phenomena from plasma chemistry,"Hirotsugu Yasuda, ","Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment, Volume 515, Issues 1每2, 1 December 2003, Pages 15-30, ","While gas discharges under atmospheric pressure occur as filamentary discharges, most studies on plasma polymerization, or plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition, were carried out in low-pressure (low-temperature, non-equilibrium) plasma.

Plasma polymerization as a potential cause of aging effects is reviewed with respect to (1) polymerization in DC discharge, (2) competitive ablation and polymerization principle, and (3) from the viewpoint of detector wire aging."

The martensitic transformation is simultaneously observed within the L邦ders band in varying degrees depending on the testing temperature. It is well verified that the martensitic transformation is not responsible for the formation of L邦ders band, and a reasonable explanation is given for the non-monotonic variation of L邦ders strain with increasing temperature."
Active control of elastic wave propagation in nonlinear phononic crystals consisting of diatomic lattice chain,"Yi-Ze Wang, Yue-Sheng Wang, ","Wave Motion, Volume 78, April 2018, Pages 1-8, ","This work studies the active control effects on nonlinear phononic crystals by the piezoelectric spring model. Both negative and positive proportional control actions are considered. Based on the Lindstedt每Poincar谷 method, the approximate solution is derived and the stop band properties are presented. Numerical calculations show that the structural stiffness and negative proportional control of the piezoelectric spring can create a new stop band which is under the acoustic branch. But the positive proportional case has a different influence because of a critical wave number appearing. Moreover, the optic branch can be uplifted by the elastic wave amplitude. Different from the soft nonlinear characteristic, the hard nonlinear property can increase the stop band width."
Unified nonlinear optimal flight control and state estimation of highly maneuverable aircraft,"Ming Xin, ","Aerospace Science and Technology, Volume 37, August 2014, Pages 70-80, ","In this paper, a nonlinear flight control and a nonlinear state observer are designed in one unified framework for a high performance aircraft. The flight control is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem and the 牟-D technique is utilized to design a closed-form optimal control law by solving the associated Hamilton每Jacobi每Bellman equation approximately via a perturbation process. Motivated by the notion that control and estimation are dual concepts, a new 牟-D observer is developed to estimate the state used in the feedback by constructing the dual of the 牟-D controller. Theoretical analysis of the proposed observer is given. Since both the optimal flight control and the state observer are unified in the same 牟-D algorithm that leads to closed-form solutions to the optimal control and observer gains, this scheme greatly facilitates onboard implementation due to its computation efficiency. The unified design method is applied to a highly maneuverable aircraft operating at high angles of attack. Simulation results show that the 牟-D control-牟-D observer suite exhibits excellent performance."

Under the guidance of a theoretical framework that combines the force-field theory of change and the theory of mechanism, this study conducted a case study on two Chinese urban governments and built a dynamic mechanism model for IGDS. The model consists of six forces acting on IGDS, as well as their activities, effects and interactions. Some effects of them are context-dependent. This model can be used to explain the reasons of various barriers to IGDS and thus to guide government departments and policy makers design more specific and targeted dynamic mechanisms to promote IGDS. Finally, several mechanisms were discussed in the context of policy making."
Ultra-fine SiO2 nanofilament-based PMIA: A double network membrane for efficient filtration of PM particles,"Longgang Zhong, Tao Wang, Liyuan Liu, Wenhao Du, Sheng Wang, ","Separation and Purification Technology, Volume 202, 31 August 2018, Pages 357-364, ","Alarming levels of particulate matter (PM) in air pose a serious health threat in several countries; therefore, there is a strong need for an economic and viable technology for air filtration. In this work, a facile and green approach is proposed to fabricate a double-network membrane for efficient filtration of fine PM particles. The membrane is composed of binary hierarchical structures, including scaffold poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (PMIA) nanofibers, and intertwine ultra-fine SiO2 nanofilaments on its surface. The presence of SiO2 nanofilaments notably changed the morphology, specific surface area and porosity of the pristine PMIA nanofibers without reducing the mechanical strength. The PM capture measurement demonstrates that the hybrid membrane exhibited a significantly better PM capture than the bare PMIA membrane, and the removal efficiencies of PM2.5 and PM10 were 97.33% and 98.48%, respectively.Download high-res image (183KB)Download full-size image"

Hypersonic entry vehicle state estimation using nonlinearity-based adaptive cubature Kalman filters,"Tao Sun, Ming Xin, ","Acta Astronautica, Volume 134, May 2017, Pages 221-230, ","Guidance, navigation, and control of a hypersonic vehicle landing on the Mars rely on precise state feedback information, which is obtained from state estimation. The high uncertainty and nonlinearity of the entry dynamics make the estimation a very challenging problem. In this paper, a new adaptive cubature Kalman filter is proposed for state trajectory estimation of a hypersonic entry vehicle. This new adaptive estimation strategy is based on the measure of nonlinearity of the stochastic system. According to the severity of nonlinearity along the trajectory, the high degree cubature rule or the conventional third degree cubature rule is adaptively used in the cubature Kalman filter. This strategy has the benefit of attaining higher estimation accuracy only when necessary without causing excessive computation load. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive filter exhibits better performance than the conventional third-degree cubature Kalman filter while maintaining the same performance as the uniform high degree cubature Kalman filter but with lower computation complexity."
An initiative using informatics to facilitate clinical research planning and recruitment in the VA health care system,"Kandi E. Velarde, Jennifer M. Romesser, Marcus R. Johnson, Daniel O. Clegg, Grant D. Huang, ","Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications, Volume 11, September 2018, Pages 107-112, ","Randomized clinical trials are the gold standard for evaluating healthcare interventions and, more generally, add to the medical knowledge related to the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of diseases and conditions. Recent literature continues to identify health informatics methods that can help improve study efficiency throughout the life cycle of a clinical trial. Electronic medical record (EMR) data provides a mechanism to facilitate clinical trial research during the study planning and execution phases, and ultimately, can be utilized to enhance recruitment. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a strong history of clinical and epidemiological research with over four decades of data collected from Veterans it has served nationwide. The VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) provides VA research investigators with a nationwide view of high-value VA patient data. Within VA, the Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) Network of Dedicated Enrollment Sites (NODES) is a consortium of nine sites that are part of an embedded clinical research infrastructure intended to provide systematic site-level solutions to issues that arise during the conduct of VA CSP clinical research. This paper describes the collaboration initiated by the Salt Lake City (SLC) node site to bring informatics and clinical trials together to enhance study planning and recruitment within the VA.The SLC VA Medical Center physically houses both VINCI and a node site and the co-location of these two groups prompted a natural collaboration on both a local and national level. One of the functions of the SLC NODES is to enhance recruitment and promote the success of CSP projects. VINCI supports these efforts by providing VA researchers access to potential population pools. VINCI can provide 1) feasibility data during study planning, and 2) active patient lists during recruitment. The process for CSP study teams to utilize these services involves regulatory documentation, development of queries, revisions to the initial data request, and ongoing communications with several key study personnel including the requesting research team, study statisticians, and VINCI data managers.The early efforts of SLC NODES and VINCI aimed to provide patient lists exclusively to the SLC CSP study teams for the following purposes: 1) increasing recruitment for trials that were struggling to meet their respective enrollment goals, and 2) decreasing the time required by study coordinators to complete chart review activities. This effort was expanded to include multiple CSP sites and studies. To date, SLC NODES has facilitated the delivery of these VINCI services to nine active CSP studies.The ability of clinical trial study teams to successfully plan and execute their respective trials is contingent upon their proficiency in obtaining data that will help them efficiently and effectively recruit and enroll eligible participants. This collaboration demonstrates that the utilization of a model that partners two distinct entities, with similar objectives, was effective in the provision of feasibility and patient lists to clinical trial study teams and facilitation of clinical trial research within a large, integrated healthcare system."
MMP-2 inhibits PCSK9-induced degradation of the LDL receptor in Hepa1-c1c7 cells,"Xiang Wang, Evan Berry, Samuel Hernandez-Anzaldo, Difei Sun, Carlos Fernandez-Patron, ","FEBS Letters, Volume 589, Issue 4, 13 February 2015, Pages 490-496, ","Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) catalyzes the uptake of LDL-cholesterol by liver and peripheral organs. The function of the LDLR is antagonized by pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which binds to LDLR at the plasma membrane inducing LDLR degradation. Here, we report that matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) interacts with and cleaves PCSK9, as evidenced by proteomic, chemical cross-linkage, blue native-PAGE and domain-specific antibodies Western blot analyses. Furthermore, MMP-2 overexpression renders Hepa1-c1c7 cells resistant to PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation. The data suggest that pathological MMP-2 overexpression may protect the LDLR from PCSK-9-induced degradation."

Therefore, it is of great importance to develop cost-effective technologies of producing clean mill scale. In this research, an in-process separation technology has been developed to produce the clean mill scale by dynamic separation from the fast-moving flume wastewater. An industrial trial was carried out to capture mill scale particles from the fast-moving flume wastewater with a strong magnet at an ArcelorMittal hot rolling plant. The results show that the dynamically-separated flume mill scale is much cleaner, containing about 6每30 time less oil than the conventional statically-separated pit mill scale. Oil concentrations in the flume mill scale samples are all significantly less than 0.5%, the commonly recognized oil limit in the mill scale for recycling in iron ore sintering. Size-by-size analysis shows that in every size fraction, the oil concentration in the flume mill scale particles is significantly less than that in the pit mill scale particles, and hence the cleaner flume mill scale is not due to coarser particle sizes. The much shorter residence time of the flume mill scale particles in the oily wastewater and the much stronger turbulence of the flume wastewater could be two of the main reasons why the flume mill scale is cleaner than the pit mill scale.Download high-res image (106KB)Download full-size image"

The aim of this study was to develop a novel intelligent hybrid sponge for use in a dense co-culture system designed to simulate the liver microenvironment. We prepared a galactosylated chitosan (GCs)/hyaluronic acid (HA) hybrid sponge using a freeze-drying technique for the co-culture of primary hepatocytes and endothelial cells. Subsequently, we investigated the biocompatibility of the GCs/HA scaffold with primary hepatocytes and endothelial cells in terms of cell attachment, morphology, bioactivity, and maintenance of specific liver functions. The GCs/HA-hybrid sponge demonstrated good biocompatibility not only with primary hepatocytes, but also with endothelial cells. In our model, primary hepatocytes exhibited superior bioactivity and higher levels of liver-specific functions in terms of hepatocyte-specific gene expression, urea production, and testosterone metabolism as compared to a monoculture system. We succeeded in constructing a liver tissue-like model using the GCs/HA-hybrid sponge. Therefore, we anticipate that GCs/HA-hybrid sponges may be a promising matrix for the co-culture of hepatocytes and endothelial cells in liver tissue engineering, and might be employed as a novel co-culture model for applications in toxicology and drug metabolism."

Nonreciprocal phenomenon in nonlinear elastic wave metamaterials with continuous properties,"Zhen-Ni Li, Yi-Ze Wang, Yue-Sheng Wang, ","International Journal of Solids and Structures, Volume 150, 1 October 2018, Pages 125-134, ","The nonreciprocal phenomenon appears in nonlinear acoustic metamaterial which are composed of a linear phononic crystal and a nonlinear layer.

Naturally, people will wonder whether the nonreciprocal phenomenon can be found in nonlinear elastic wave metamaterial. Because of the coupling of the multi-displacements, this problem becomes more complicated but interesting for waves in solid. Motivated by this enlightenment, we will discuss the band gap and transmission properties of elastic waves in both linear and nonlinear periodic systems. The fundamental and double frequency waves can be generated by the interaction between SH waves and the nonlinearity of materials. According to continuity conditions of incident SH wave, the transfer matrices are derived. The stop band and transmission coefficient are obtained by Bloch's law. This research is expected to be helpful to develop new elastic wave metamaterial devices."

The algorithm for excision of these tumors is typically based on the tumor's characteristics; excision is performed via approaches such as the trans-oral route, the trans-cervical route, and even a combination of the trans-parotid route and mandibulotomy. However, each of these approaches is associated with some complications. Endoscope-assisted minimally invasive surgery is being increasingly employed for surgeries in the head and neck regions. It has the advantage of leaving no facial scars, and ensures better patient comfort after the operation. Here, we report the use of endoscope-assisted trans-oral surgery for excision of parapharyngeal space tumors. The technique yields an excellent outcome and should be a feasible, safe, and economic method for these patients."

Activated diffusion of permanent gases in 4a zeolite at low coverage,"Weirou Sun, Carlos A. V. Costa, ","Chemical Engineering Science, Volume 49, Issue 12, June 1994, Pages 1913-1923, ","A predictive methodology for calculating intracrystalline diffusivities of small molecular gases in 4A zeolite is developed. The intracrystalline diffusion path is composed by alternate cavities and windows. An exchangeable cation located at the eight-membered ring window partially blocks the diffusion path. Only when the diffusing molecule has enough translational kinetic energy it can overcome the window repulsion. The probability of a molecule crossing the window depends on its kinetic energy distribution and on the affinity between the cation and the window oxygen atoms. Classical and quantum mechanics are used to calculated the kinetic energy distribution and the results are different, specially in the high energy region. This difference directly reflects on the calculation of the intracrystalline diffusivities. The predicted intracrystalline diffusivities and diffusion activation energies for argon, nitrogen and oxygen in 4A zeolite are in the range of published experimental data."
The cluster-plus-glue-atom models of solid solution CuNi alloys: A first-principles study,"Jiang Lu, Shang-Yi Ma, Xin-Xin Wang, Shao-Qing Wang, ","Computational Materials Science, Volume 143, 15 February 2018, Pages 439-445, ","The solid solution alloys containing short-range order (SRO) structure, such as CuNi alloys, are not well structurally described using conventional quasi-disordered models. Based on the first-principles calculations, the optimal cluster-plus-glue-atom (CPGA) models of six typical solid solution CuNi alloys were demonstrated. These CPGA models are better to be used to describe the microstructure of the six CuNi alloys at the atomic scale from the viewpoint of energy. Our further study shown that the stabilities of CPGA models are highly related to the symmetry of initial CPGA models and the aggregation degree of solute atoms in CPGA models. In the condition of low solute Ni concentration, the stability of CPGA model is mostly determined by the symmetry of initial CPGA model, the CPGA model with high symmetry is more stable. As the concentration of solute Ni increasing, the aggregation degree of solute Ni atoms in CPGA models plays more and more important role. The CPGA model with higher aggregation degree of solute Ni is more stable. The simple selection method of optimal CPGA models, therefore is proposed, and which can be extended to other bielement solid solution AB alloys with positive mixing enthalpy of A-B. Using the selected CPGA models, we found the third additive atoms having negative mixing enthalpy with solvent and solute atoms prefer to reside the central site of characteristic principal cluster (CPC) of CPGA, and thereby enhancing the stability of alloys. Our studies provide a distinctive perspective to select the optimal CPGA models of solid solution alloys containing SRO structure and design alloy using the optimal CPGA model.Download high-res image (177KB)Download full-size image"
Improving the performance of weighted Lagrange-multiplier methods for nonlinear constrained optimization,"Benjamin W. Wah, Tao Wang, Yi Shang, Zhe Wu, ","Information Sciences, Volume 124, Issues 1每4, May 2000, Pages 241-272, ","Nonlinear constrained optimization problems in discrete and continuous spaces are an important class of problems studied extensively in artificial intelligence and operations research. These problems can be solved by a Lagrange-multiplier method in continuous space and by an extended discrete Lagrange-multiplier method in discrete space. When constraints are satisfied, these methods rely on gradient descents in the objective space to find high-quality solutions. On the other hand, when constraints are violated, these methods rely on gradient ascents in the Lagrange-multiplier space in order to increase the penalties on unsatisfied constraints and to force the constraints into satisfaction. The balance between gradient descents and gradient ascents depends on the relative weights between the objective function and the constraints, which indirectly control the convergence speed and solution quality of the Lagrangian method. To improve convergence speed without degrading solution quality, we propose an algorithm to dynamically control the relative weights between the objective and the constraints. Starting from an initial weight, the algorithm automatically adjusts the weights based on the behavior of the search progress. With this strategy, we are able to eliminate divergence, reduce oscillation, and speed up convergence. We show improved convergence behavior of our proposed algorithm on both nonlinear continuous and discrete problems."

The origin of clay-coated sand grains and sediment heterogeneity in tidal flats,"Luke J. Wooldridge, Richard H. Worden, Joshua Griffiths, James E. P. Utley, Anu Thompson, ","Sedimentary Geology, Volume 373, 1 October 2018, Pages 191-209, ","The presence and distribution of clay minerals attached to grain surfaces as coats (also known as rims) are of great interest because they affect petroleum reservoir quality via the inhibition of the porosity-occluding quartz cement during prolonged burial and heating. Being able to predict the distribution of clay-coated sand grains in petroleum reservoirs is thus important to help find and exploit anomalously high porosity sandstones deep in sedimentary basins. The few studies focused on the distribution of clay coats in marginal marine sediments derive from surface sediment-based data sets, with limited emphasis placed on the preservation of the surface trends in sediment undergoing eodiagenesis in the near-surface environments. The post-depositional processes of bioturbation (sediment homogenization) and infiltration of clay into sand-grade sediment have been widely invoked as potential mechanisms that produce clay coats in modern sands and ancient sandstones. However, the potential for such processes to alter surface trends and govern clay-coat distribution in the subsurface remains unconstrained. In this study, we report the development of a novel, quantitative model of clay-coat coverage in order to identify the controlling mechanisms that govern clay-coat distributions. This study has focused on surface and near-surface sediments in the Saltcoats tidal flat deposits of the Ravenglass Estuary, UK. This unique bio-sedimentary study involved geomorphic mapping, core logging, a range of scanning electron microscopy techniques, and quantification of grain-size, clay fraction content, biofilm abundance (total carbohydrate and biomarker analysis), clay-coat coverage, and clay-coat mineralogy. In this study, against established convention, we demonstrate that infiltration and bioturbation do not significantly affect clay-coat grain coverage in near-surface sediments. Instead, we show that the extent, distribution, and mineralogy of clay coats in near-surface sediment are governed by the surface-based hydrological segregation of the clay mineral assemblage and biological clay-coat formation."

Validation of Risk Assessment Models of Venous Thromboembolism in Hospitalized Medical Patients,"M. Todd Greene, Alex C. Spyropoulos, Vineet Chopra, Paul J. Grant, Scott A.

Although risk assessment is recommended and several at-admission risk assessment models have been developed, these have not been adequately derived or externally validated. Therefore, an optimal approach to evaluate venous thromboembolism risk in medical patients is not known.We conducted an external validation study of existing venous thromboembolism risk assessment models using data collected on 63,548 hospitalized medical patients as part of the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety (HMS) Consortium. For each patient, cumulative venous thromboembolism risk scores and risk categories were calculated. Cox regression models were used to quantify the association between venous thromboembolism events and assigned risk categories. Model discrimination was assessed using Harrell's C-index.Venous thromboembolism incidence in hospitalized medical patients is low (1%). Although existing risk assessment models demonstrate good calibration (hazard ratios for ※at-risk§ range 2.97-3.59), model discrimination is generally poor for all risk assessment models (C-index range 0.58-0.64).The performance of several existing risk assessment models for predicting venous thromboembolism among acutely ill, hospitalized medical patients at admission is limited. Given the low venous thromboembolism incidence in this nonsurgical patient population, careful consideration of how best to utilize existing venous thromboembolism risk assessment models is necessary, and further development and validation of novel venous thromboembolism risk assessment models for this patient population may be warranted."

Delay-constrained transmission of fine scalable coded content over P2P networks,"Xiao Su, Yi Shang, Tao Wang, Yuqing Mai, ","Signal Processing: Image Communication, Volume 20, Issue 1, January 2005, Pages 21-37, ","Images or videos are generally coded before transmission, and they can be either non-scalable coded or scalable coded, which can be further classified into fine-scalable coded and coarse-scalable coded. In this paper, we focus on delivery of fine-scalable coded content. The objective of our work is to design algorithms to optimize the quality of fine-scalable coded images or videos on peer-to-peer networks when a requesting peer is delay-sensitive and has to display content within a certain delay bound.Fine-scalable coding has two properties: (1) it embeds lower bit-rate bitstreams into higher bit-rate bitstreams; and (2) its coding quality increases with every additional bit in the coded bitstream. These imply that for a given requesting peer, there may exist a dynamic set of supplying peers that have the same content coded in different bit-rates, have different outgoing bandwidth and may finish transmission at different times.In this paper, we first illustrate the importance of peer assignment problem using an example. Then we formally define and formulate the problem as two integer programming problems, from which we derive an optimal peer assignment solution. Finally, we carry out extensive experiments to verify the excellent performance of the proposed peer assignment algorithms by comparing with other heuristic schemes."

Random-walk technique for simulating NMR measurements and 2D NMR maps of porous media with relaxing and permeable boundaries,"Emmanuel Toumelin, Carlos Torres-Verd赤n, Boqin Sun, Keh-Jim Dunn, ","Journal of Magnetic Resonance, Volume 188, Issue 1, September 2007, Pages 83-96, ","We revisit random-walk methods to simulate the NMR response of fluids in porous media. Simulations reproduce the effects of diffusion within external inhomogeneous background magnetic fields, imperfect and finite-duration B1 pulses, T1/T2 contrasts, and relaxing or permeable boundaries. The simulation approach consolidates existing NMR numerical methods used in biology and engineering into a single formulation that expands on the magnetic-dipole equivalent of spin packets. When fluids exhibit low T1/T2 contrasts and when CPMG pulse sequences are used to acquire NMR measurements, we verify that classical NMR numerical models that neglect T1 effects accurately reproduce surface magnetization decays of saturated granular porous media regardless of the diffusion/relaxation regime. Currently, analytical expressions exist only for the case of arbitrary pore shapes within the fast-diffusion limit. However, when fluids include several components or when magnetic fields are strongly inhomogeneous, we show that simulations results obtained using the complete set of Bloch＊s equations differ substantially from those of classical NMR models. In addition, our random-walk formulation accurately reproduces magnetization echoes stemming from coherent-pathway calculations. We show that the random-walk approach is especially suited to generate parametric multi-dimensional T1/T2/D NMR maps to improve the characterization of pore structures and saturating fluids."

The ectopic expression of DANCR significantly increased the proliferation, migration and invasion of SPC-A1 and NCL-H1299 cells. Furthermore, we investigated whether DANCR regulates NSCLC tumor formation in vivo.

Network-Based Disease Module Discovery by a Novel Seed Connector Algorithm with Pathobiological Implications,"Rui-Sheng Wang, Joseph Loscalzo, ","Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 430, Issue 18, Part A, 14 September 2018, Pages 2939-2950, ","Understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases is challenging. Prior work shows that disease-related proteins do not typically function in isolation. Rather, they often interact with each other to form a network module that underlies dysfunctional mechanistic pathways. Identifying such disease modules will provide insights into a systems-level understanding of molecular mechanisms of diseases. Owing to the incompleteness of our knowledge of disease proteins and limited information on the biological mediators of pathobiological processes, the key proteins (seed proteins) for many diseases appear scattered over the human protein每protein interactome and form a few small branches, rather than coherent network modules. In this paper, we develop a network-based algorithm, called the Seed Connector algorithm (SCA), to pinpoint disease modules by adding as few additional linking proteins (seed connectors) to the seed protein pool as possible. Such seed connectors are hidden disease module elements that are critical for interpreting the functional context of disease proteins. The SCA aims to connect seed disease proteins so that disease mechanisms and pathways can be decoded based on predicted coherent network modules. We validate the algorithm using a large corpus of 70 complex diseases and binding targets of over 200 drugs, and demonstrate the biological relevance of the seed connectors. Lastly, as a specific proof of concept, we apply the SCA to a set of seed proteins for coronary artery disease derived from a meta-analysis of large-scale genome-wide association studies and obtain a coronary artery disease module enriched with important disease-related signaling pathways and drug targets not previously recognized.Download high-res image (31KB)Download full-size image"
Transcription Factor IRF8 Orchestrates the Adaptive Natural Killer Cell Response,"Nicholas M. Adams, Colleen M. Lau, Xiying Fan, Moritz Rapp, Joseph C. Sun, ","Immunity, Volume 48, Issue 6, 19 June 2018, Pages 1172-1182.e6, ","Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that display features of adaptive immunity during viral infection. Biallelic mutations in IRF8 have been reported to cause familial NK cell deficiency and susceptibility to severe viral infection in humans; however, the precise role of this transcription factor in regulating NK cell function remains unknown. Here, we show that cell-intrinsic IRF8 was required for NK-cell-mediated protection against mouse cytomegalovirus infection. During viral exposure, NK cells upregulated IRF8 through interleukin-12 (IL-12) signaling and the transcription factor STAT4, which promoted epigenetic remodeling of the Irf8 locus. Moreover, IRF8 facilitated the proliferative burst of virus-specific NK cells by promoting expression of cell-cycle genes and directly controlling Zbtb32, a master regulator of virus-driven NK cell proliferation. These findings identify the function and cell-type-specific regulation of IRF8 in NK-cell-mediated antiviral immunity and provide a mechanistic understanding of viral susceptibility in patients with IRF8 mutations.Download high-res image (171KB)Download full-size image"
Collagen secretion screening in Drosophila supports a common secretory machinery and multiple Rab requirements,"Hongmei Ke, Zhi Feng, Min Liu, Tianhui Sun, Jos谷 Carlos Pastor-Pareja, ","Journal of Genetics and Genomics, Volume 45, Issue 6, 20 June 2018, Pages 299-313, ","Collagens are large secreted trimeric proteins making up most of the animal extracellular matrix. Secretion of collagen has been a focus of interest for cell biologists in recent years because collagen trimers are too large and rigid to fit into the COPII vesicles mediating transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi. Collagen-specific mechanisms to create enlarged ER-to-Golgi transport carriers have been postulated, including cargo loading by conserved ER exit site (ERES) protein Tango1. Here, we report an RNAi screening for genes involved in collagen secretion in Drosophila. In this screening, we examined distribution of GFP-tagged Collagen IV in live animals and found 88 gene hits for which the knockdown produced intracellular accumulation of Collagen IV in the fat body, the main source of matrix proteins in the larva. Among these hits, only two affected collagen secretion specifically: PH4汐EFB and Plod, encoding enzymes known to mediate posttranslational modification of collagen in the ER. Every other intracellular accumulation hit affected general secretion, consistent with the notion that secretion of collagen does not use a specific mode of vesicular transport, but the general secretory pathway. Included in our hits are many known players in the eukaryotic secretory machinery, like COPII and COPI components, SNAREs and Rab-GTPase regulators. Our further analysis of the involvement of Rab-GTPases in secretion shows that Rab1, Rab2 and RabX3, are all required at ERES, each of them differentially affecting ERES morphology. Abolishing activity of all three by Rep knockdown, in contrast, led to uncoupling of ERES and Golgi. We additionally present a characterization of a screening hit we named trabuco (tbc), encoding an ERES-localized TBC domain-containing Rab-GAP. Finally, we discuss the success of our screening in identifying secretory pathway genes in comparison to two previous secretion screenings in Drosophila S2 cells."
Enhancing methanol electrooxidation activity using double oxide catalyst support of tin oxide clusters on doped titanium dioxides,"Ahmed M. Jasim, Samuel E.

Formation kinetics of the oxygenated species (OH) groups was dramatically enhanced in the catalyst with double oxide support. This leads to a much lower onset potential for adsorbed CO oxidation with a much enhanced bifunctional effect in tin oxide. The electrocatalyst demonstrated a higher forward peak current density in methanol electrooxidation than the electrocatalyst with single tin oxide or bare carbon as support. Binding energy shift in oxidation states was observed for the double oxide support catalyst and is attributed to strong metal support interactions. Doping with carbon in the titanium oxide enables backward electron donation, making the supported platinum more electron negative and stable. This study demonstrated a synergistic effect of combining bifunctional and electronic mechanisms with double oxide support in the enhancement of methanol electrooxidation."

Extending the Rational Method for assessing and developing sustainable urban drainage systems,"Sheng Wang, Heng Wang, ","Water Research, Volume 144, 1 November 2018, Pages 112-125, ","Onsite runoff control is considered an important part of sustainable urban drainage schemes, but estimating the maximum runoff flow rate from a catchment with onsite runoff controls remains controversial. Runoff controls complicate the issue by dividing the catchment into several subcatchments that feed into individual runoff controls, which dynamically regulate the catchment imperviousness. Rational Method (RM) is the most-employed technique to determine maximum flow rates for designing urban drainage infrastructures, but it cannot handle such conditions. Nonetheless, it has advantages over alternative methods in terms of principle from the urban drainage design perspective. This work develops Rational Method Prime (RMP) that follows the basic principle of RM but instead recalculates catchment variables by taking into account runoff control effects and evaluates runoff control efficiencies by using two indices. RMP has three merits: (1) providing an integrated response of the whole catchment with runoff controls; (2) interpreting runoff control effects by plotting runoff flow rate-rainfall duration curves; (3) connecting the design of runoff controls and storm sewers that are based on different design principles and rainfall statistics. Case study results showed that runoff controls reduced peak flow rates by 5.83每91.6%, corresponding to reduction factors for return period of maximum flow rate from 0.04 to 0.76. Indeed, the original RM is based on four assumptions, which also cause its weakness, and there have been current methods to address 3 of them. RMP contributes to addressing the last assumption (i.e. constant catchment imperviousness), which finally allowing the evolution from RM 1.0 to 2.0.Download high-res image (214KB)Download full-size image"
Positioning using local maps,"Yi Shang, Wheeler Ruml, Markus P. J.

However, in a large network it is impractical to build a single global map. In this paper, we present a new approach for distributed localization called Positioning using Local Maps (PLM). Given a path between a starting node and a remote node we wish to localize, the nodes along the path each compute a map of their local neighborhood. Adjacent nodes then align their maps, and the relative position of the remote node can then be determined in the coordinate system of the starting node. Nodes with known positions can easily be incorporated to determine absolute coordinates. We instantiate the PLM framework using the previously proposed MDS-MAP(P) algorithm to generate the local maps. Through simulation experiments, we compare the resulting algorithm, which we call MDS-MAP(D), with existing distributed methods and show improved performance on both uniform and irregular topologies."
Numerical study of the critical drop size on a thin horizontal fiber: Effect of fiber shape and contact angle,"Sheng Wang, Olivier Desjardins, ","Chemical Engineering Science, Volume 187, 21 September 2018, Pages 127-133, ","Fiber-based coalescers are widely used in the chemical industry to separate two immiscible fluids. Due to the complex structure inside a coalescer and the opaque nature of the fiber material, it is impractical to perform direct visualization and measurement of the multiphase flow inside a coalescer. One fundamental problem in understanding the physics inside a liquid-gas coalescer is to determine the maximum size of a drop that can attach and remain on a fiber. Previous studies (Hung and Yao, 1999; Lorenceau et al., 2004; Wang and Desjardins, 2018) have provided models to estimate the maximum size of a drop on a horizontal cylindrical fiber under gravity or cross-flow.

I百B-汕 regulates the persistent response in a biphasic activation of NF-百B,"James E Thompson, Roderick J Phillips, Hediye Erdjument-Bromage, Paul Tempst, Sankar Ghosh, ","Cell, Volume 80, Issue 4, 24 February 1995, Pages 573-582, ","We have cloned the cDNA encoding I百B-汕, one of the two major I百B isoforms in mammalian cells. The recombinant I百B-汕 protein interacts with equal affinity to p65 and c-Rel and does not exhibit a preference between these Rel proteins. Instead the primary difference between I百B-汐 and I百B-汕 is in their response to different inducers of NF-百B activity. One class of inducers causes rapid but transient activation of NF-百B by primarily affecting I百B-汐 complexes, whereas another class of inducers causes persistent activation of NF-百B by affecting both I百B-汐 and I百B-汕 complexes. Therefore, the overall activation of NF-百B consists of two overlapping phases, a transient phase mediated through I百B-汐 and a persistent phase mediated through I百B-汕."
A pilot study exploring the measurement of intergenerational differences in independent mobility,"Julie Bhosale, Scott Duncan, Grant Schofield, Angie Page, Ashley Cooper, ","Journal of Transport & Health, Volume 2, Issue 4, December 2015, Pages 522-528, ","A fundamental issue limiting the understanding of children's independent mobility (IM) is the absence of a standardised measurement method. This pilot study explored the use of three different measures of IM to assess intergenerational change and investigated social perceptions in children's unsupervised roaming.Data were collected for 45 participants from three directly-related generations. IM was assessed and analysed in all participants using three measures; IM Licence (permission to travel unsupervised), IM Index (the summed score from multiple items on a questionnaire) and IM Maximum (maximum roaming distance from participants' residential addresses located on Google Maps). Qualitative data were collected from all participants regarding perceptions of IM.Significant correlations between IM Index and IM Maximum were observed for child participants (R2=0.334) but not for parents (R2=0.024) or grandparents (R2=0.284). IM Licence was not comparable with either IM Index or IM Maximum. Decreases in IM from grandparent to child were observed for all three measures of IM, with some children experiencing extremely low levels of IM.The results highlight the need for a standard measurement protocol for IM that facilitates comparability among studies. Maximum IM distance estimated via web-based interactive mapping may be a promising choice in this respect."

A new constraint test-case generator and the importance of hybrid optimizers,"Yi Shang, Markus P. J. Fromherz, Lara Crawford, ","European Journal of Operational Research, Volume 173, Issue 2, 1 September 2006, Pages 419-443, ","In the past decade, significant progress has been made in understanding problem complexity of discrete constraint problems. In contrast, little similar work has been done for constraint problems in the continuous domain. In this paper, we study the complexity of typical methods for non-linear constraint problems and present hybrid solvers with improved performance. To facilitate the empirical study, we propose a new test-case generator for generating non-linear constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and constrained optimization problems (COPs). The optimization methods tested include a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method, a penalty method with a fixed penalty function, a penalty method with a sequence of penalty functions, and an augmented Lagrangian method. For hybrid solvers, we focus on the form that combines two or more optimization methods in sequence. In the experiments, we apply these methods to solve a series of continuous constraint problems with increasing constraint-to-variable ratios. The test problems include artificial benchmark problems from the test-case generator and problems derived from controlling a hyper-redundant modular manipulator. We obtain novel results on complexity phase transition phenomena of the various methods. Specifically, for constraint satisfaction problems, the SQP method is the best on weakly constrained problems, whereas the augmented Lagrangian method is the best on highly constrained ones. Although the static penalty method performs poorly by itself, by combining it with the SQP method, we show a hybrid solver that is significantly better than any of the individual methods on problems with moderate to large constraint-to-variable ratios. For constrained optimization problems, the hybrid solver obtains much better solutions than SQP, while spending comparable amount of time. In addition, the hybrid solver is flexible and can achieve good results on time-bounded applications by setting parameters according to the time limits."

Twenty BPD and 20 healthy control participants, aged 15每24 years, viewed a set of standardized pictures with pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant valence, and were instructed to either ※maintain§ or ※suppress§ their emotional response to the stimuli. Despite showing markedly higher levels of baseline distress on self-report questionnaires, BPD participants had significantly lower skin conductance responses and showed an absence of the fear potentiated startle response during early picture processing. Both groups showed similar startle responses later in picture processing, and when instructed to ※maintain§ or ※suppress§ their emotions. BPD participants were hypo-responsive to aversive stimuli during early processing, and did not react with more intense emotional responses to affective stimuli or show a diminished ability to regulate their responses. These results might be consistent with the finding that hypersensitivity of emotional response in BPD is specific to stimuli with themes of particular relevance to this disorder, such as rejection and abandonment."

Optimization design of biorthogonal filter banks for image compression,"Yi Shang, Longzhuang Li, Benjamin Wah, ","Information Sciences, Volume 132, Issues 1每4, February 2001, Pages 23-51, ","In this paper, we present a new approach for designing filter banks for image compression. This approach has two major components: optimization and generalization. In the optimization phase, we formulate the design problem as a nonlinear optimization problem whose objective consists of both the performance metrics of the image coder, such as the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and those of individual filters. Filter banks are optimized in the optimization phase based on a set of training images. In the generalization phase, the filter bank that can be generalized to other images is selected from the candidates obtained in the optimization phase to be the final result. The filter bank selected should perform well not only on the training examples used in the design process but also on test cases not seen. In contrast to existing methods that design filter banks independently from the other operations in an image compression algorithm, our approach allows us to find filter banks that work best in a specific image compression algorithm for a certain class of images. In system prototype development, we adopt the agent-based approach to achieve better modularity, portability, and scalability. Agents in the multi-agent system are specialized in performing problem formulation, image compression, optimization, and generalization. In the experiments, we show that on a set of benchmark images our approach has found filter banks that perform better than the existing filter banks in different image compression algorithms and at different compression ratios."

The 3D topography of the milled surface was studied as well. The results indicate that 3D parameters (Sa and Sq) are more capable to describe the influence of the milling parameters on the surface quality, and among them Sq is preferable due to its good sensitivity. Sq decreases with milling speed and increases with feed rate. The influence of axial depth of cut (ADOC) is negligible."

The minimisation scheme is carried out using our iterated dynamic programming algorithm, which iterates over entire rows and columns for fast stereo matching. A quadtree subregioning process is also used for efficient computation of a matching cost volume where iterated dynamic programming operates on."
Determining shape of a seasonally shadowed asteroid using stellar occultation imaging,"Scott L. Murchie, Hari Nair, Grant K. Stephens, ","Planetary and Space Science, Volume 131, 15 October 2016, Pages 24-32, ","A key objective in exploration of small, asteroidal bodies is to determine global shape and volume. The accuracy to which volume can be determined limits determination of bulk density, an important measurement for understanding internal structure. A special case for a rendezvous mission that uses stereo imaging to determine shape is a body with high obliquity encountered near solstice: half of the body is in shadow, and imaging of illuminated terrain alone under-constrains global shape. In this paper we demonstrate the use of stellar occultation imaging to place an upper bound on volume of such a shadowed hemisphere. Thirty-three sets of images of the night side limb of Mercury, acquired by the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) wide-angle camera (WAC) on MESSENGER, were used to bound the radius of that planet's night side. The maximum radius determined from this limited image set agrees with the actual radius to within ~0.1%. We show, by simulation, expected performance of a campaign of such night side limb images to bound the shape of an irregular, high-obliquity asteroid encountered at solstice. We assumed a body the size and shape of Deimos imaged from a 40-km radius orbit by an imager having specifications of the MDIS/WAC but an updated detector sensitive to mv~10 stars, and a day-side stereo imaging campaign by a well-calibrated camera system. From an equatorial orbit, with one hemisphere in shadow, a campaign of ≡150 night side limb images determines volume of the shadowed hemisphere to ~4 to 6% accuracy. Increasing orbital inclination to improve sampling of high latitudes decreases residuals for the dark hemisphere by 2 to 3%, for the same number of images. A ~2 to 3% uncertainty in global volume 每 from stereo imaging of illuminated terrain and stellar occultation imaging of shadowed terrain 每 compares favorably to uncertainty of up to ㊣25% in the absence of direct measurements of the radius of the shadowed hemisphere."

Nash, ","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, Volumes 237每238, 1 May 2017, Pages 362-370, ","Environmental measurement programs can add value by providing not just accurate data, but also a measure of that accuracy. While quality assurance (QA) has been recognized as necessary since almost the beginning of automated weather measurement, it has received less attention than the data proper. Most QA systems examine data limits and rate of change for gross errors and examine data for unchanging values. Others compare data from other locations using spatial tools or examine temporal consistency. There exists a need for analytical tools that can increase the likelihood of detecting small errors, such as a calibration drift, or increased variation in a sensor reading. Two such empirical tools are described herein that can inform a first level QA process. One operates on data from a single sensor, using comparisons between a current and a prior datum; the other leverages additional information from a duplicate sensor and operates on only the current datum. The objectives of this paper are to describe the computational methods, illustrate results with multiple-month datasets representing both nominal and failing sensors, provide some indications of validity of assumptions made in the derivation, and suggest where in a quality assurance program these methods could be applied. With little additional datalogger programming to obtain both the period average and the ending value, these tools could be added to QA toolkits in many automated weather stations."
Experimental complexity analysis of continuous constraint satisfaction problems,"Yi Shang, Markus P. J Fromherz, ","Information Sciences, Volume 153, July 2003, Pages 1-36, ","Continuous constraint satisfaction problems are at the core of many real-world applications, including planning, scheduling, control, and diagnosis of physical systems such as car, planes, and factories. Yet in order to be effective in such resource-constrained environments, constraint-based techniques must take into account the complexity of continuous constrained problems. In this paper, we study complexity phase transition phenomena of continuous constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). First, we analyze three continuous constraint satisfaction formulations based on (discrete) 3-SAT problems, which have a strong relation between structure and search cost. Then, we propose a generic benchmarking model for comparing continuous CSPs and algorithms, and present two example problems based on sine functions. In our experiments, these problems are solved using both local and global search methods. Besides comparing the complexities of different continuous CSPs and search algorithms, we also connect these back to results from similar studies on SAT problems. In solving continuous 3-SAT and sine-based CSPs, we find that the median search cost is characterized by simple parameters such as the constraint-to-variable ratio and constraint tightness, and that discrete search algorithms such as GSAT have continuous counter-parts with similar behavior. Regarding local versus global search techniques for constraint solving, our results show that local search methods are more efficient for weakly constrained problems, whereas global search methods work better on highly constrained problems."

Due to nonspecific effects of G1, the exact functions of cardiac GPER cannot be concluded from studies using systemic G1 administration. Moreover, global knockdown of GPER affects glucose homeostasis, blood pressure, and many other cardiovascular-related systems, thereby confounding interpretation of its direct cardiac actions. We generated a cardiomyocyte-specific GPER knockout (KO) mouse model to specifically investigate the functions of GPER in cardiomyocytes. Compared to wild type mice, cardiomyocyte-specific GPER KO mice exhibited adverse alterations in cardiac structure and impaired systolic and diastolic function, as measured by echocardiography. Gene deletion effects on left ventricular dimensions were more profound in male KO mice compared to female KO mice. Analysis of DNA microarray data from isolated cardiomyocytes of wild type and KO mice revealed sex-based differences in gene expression profiles affecting multiple transcriptional networks. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that mitochondrial genes are enriched in GPER KO females, whereas inflammatory response genes are enriched in GPER KO males, compared to their wild type counterparts of the same sex. The cardiomyocyte-specific GPER KO mouse model provides us with a powerful tool to study the functions of GPER in cardiomyocytes. The gene expression profiles of the GPER KO mice provide foundational information for further study of the mechanisms underlying sex-specific cardioprotection by GPER."

Mechanism of Janus kinase 3-catalyzed phosphorylation of a Janus kinase 1 activation loop peptide,"Ruixiu Wang, Patrick R Griffin, Eliza C Small, James E Thompson, ","Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Volume 410, Issue 1, 1 February 2003, Pages 7-15, ","A high-affinity IL-2 receptor requires two Janus protein tyrosine kinases (JAKs) for IL-2 signal transduction: JAK1 and JAK3. Since transphosphorylation of the two kinases is presumed to occur after receptor engagement we examined the phosphorylation by recombinant JAK3 of a peptide substrate corresponding to the JAK1 activation loop (KAIETDKEYYTVKD), which has two adjacent tyrosines. Mass spectral analysis of the enzymatically phosphorylated peptide showed that the second tyrosine was phosphorylated at a 30-fold greater rate than the first tyrosine. Moreover, no doubly phosphorylated peptide was detected by this analysis. Kinetic analysis of the reactions of singly phosphorylated JAK1 activation loop peptides showed that phosphorylating the first or second tyrosine decreased the kcat/Km for the phosphorylation of the other 115- and 26-fold, respectively. Singly changing each side chain of the KEYYTV portion of the peptide to a methyl group (alanine) yielded substrates comparable to the wild-type sequences in all cases except that of the first or second tyrosine, which showed a 153- or 70-fold drop in kcat/Km, respectively. Using libraries of immobilized peptides with all 20 naturally occurring amino acids substituted for Y9 or T11 showed that the JAK3 tolerated substitution at T11 but prefers large hydrophobic amino acids at Y9. These results show that JAK3 does not act processively on the JAK1 activation loop in vitro and illustrate the role of Y9 in the recognition of the preferred site of phosphorylation which is Y10."
Role of ecdysteroids and methyl farnesoate in morphogenesis and terminal moult in polymorphic males of the spider crab Libinia emarginata,"Guiomar Rotllant, Peter Takac, Lei Liu, Grant L.

Methyl farnesoate (MF), an unepoxidated form of juvenile hormone (JH III) and hydroxyecdysone, a moulting hormone, were measured in attempt to understand these processes and to determine the physiological characteristics of each morphotype, to be able to induce maturation by hormonal treatment and improve crustacean culture. Following arrival at the laboratory, ablated small-claw unabraded small-carapace males (SUM) moulted within 30 days to a juvenile and control SUM moulted within 75 days to a mature morphotype with large claws. Following eyestalk removal small-carapace abraded males (SAM), large-carapace unabraded large-claw (LUL) and large-carapace abraded large-claw (LAL) males never moulted even after 60 days, while the other ablated morphs moulted in 25每35 days. Significant increase of MF levels was observed in SUM, SAM and LUL de-stalked animals compared to intact control group, while no differences were observed in LAL individuals. In fact, LAL crabs presented the highest level of MF up to 2.23 ng/ml. Ten days prior to moulting MF increased 4-fold, and the ecdysteroids increased 15-fold in the haemolymph of ablated SUM and 25% in their testes. Ecdysteroid levels in the haemolymph of the SAM, LUL and LAL morphotypes remained low (around 5 ng/ml), and none of these animals moulted. The results strongly suggest that: (1) SUM are able to moult, and represent the juvenile stage, (2) SAM, LUL and LAL are terminally moulted and may represent the reproductive population, (3) circulating ecdysteroids induce moulting in juveniles, (4) high levels of ecdysteroids in the testes of SAM, LUL and LAL suggest a gonadal function, and (5) circulating MF controls morphogenesis of juveniles (SUM) and seems to stimulate gonads in adults."
New insights into substrate folding preference of plant OSCs,"Yongshuo Ma, Yuan Zhou, Sergey Ovchinnikov, Per Greisen, Yi Shang, ","Science Bulletin, Volume 61, Issue 18, September 2016, Pages 1407-1412, ","Sterols and triterpenes are structurally diverse bioactive molecules generated through cyclization of linear 2,3-oxidosqualene. Based on carbocationic intermediates generated during initial substrate preorganization step, oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs) are roughly segregated into protosteryl cation group that mainly catalyzes tetracyclic products and dammarenyl cation group which mostly generates pentacyclic products. However, in contrast to well-studied cascade of ring-forming reactions, little is known about the mechanism underlying the initial substrate folding process. Previously, we have identified a cucurbitadienol synthase (Bi) and its null allele bi (C393Y) from cucumber. By integration of homology modeling, residue coevolution and site-directed mutagenesis, we discover that four covarying amino acids including C393 constitute a dynamic domain that may be involved in substrate folding process for Bi. We also reveal a group of co-conserved residues that closely associated with the segregation of plant OSCs. These residues may act collaboratively in choice of specific substrate folding intermediate for OSCs. Thus, our findings open a door to engineer plant OSCs from four-ringed skeleton catalysts into five-ringed producer."
A biologically-inspired clustering protocol for wireless sensor networks,"S. Selvakennedy, S.

As sensor nodes may be deployed in hostile areas, these battery-powered nodes are mostly expected to operate for a relatively long period. Clustering is an approach actively pursued by many groups in realizing more scalable data gathering and routing. However, it is rather challenging to form an appropriate number of clusters with well balanced memberships. To this end, we propose a novel application of collective social agents to guide the formation of these clusters. In order to counter the usual problems of such meta-heuristics, we propose a novel atypical application that allows our protocol to converge fast with very limited overhead. An analysis is performed to determine the optimal number of clusters necessary to achieve the highest energy efficiency. In order to allow for a realistic evaluation, a comprehensive simulator involving critical components of the communication stack is used. Our protocol is found to ensure a good distribution of clusterheads through a totally distributed approach. To quantify certain clustering properties, we also introduced two fitness metrics that could be used to benchmark different clustering algorithms."

Validating the Soil Vulnerability Index for a claypan watershed,"Robert Chan, Claire Baffaut, Allen Thompson, John Sadler, ","CATENA, Volume 148, Part 2, January 2017, Pages 185-194, ","Assessment studies of conservation efforts have shown that best management practices were not always implemented in the most vulnerable areas where they are most needed. While complex computer simulation models can be used to identify these areas, resources needed for using such models are beyond reach for most water resources managers. Soil and water conservationists need simple, spatially explicit tools such as the USDA-NRCS's Soil Vulnerability Index (SVI) to evaluate the inherent vulnerability of soils and the risk they pose to water quality when used for row crop agriculture. In this study, the SVI was evaluated in the Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW), a claypan watershed in Missouri, using three methods: professional judgment, comparison to the Conductivity Claypan Index (CCI) developed specifically for claypan soils, and comparison to model results. Factors affecting the critical areas identified by each method were assessed and classified areas were compared. Slope and depth to claypan had the most variability in GCEW and were found to be influential in determining area classification by each index. While the original definition of SVI included the soil type representative slope from the USDA SSURGO database, slope values provided by a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) improved the index usefulness by classifying visibly degraded and non-degraded areas in different categories. High and moderately high vulnerability areas identified with SVI, CCI and model results with DEM slopes were consistent and matched professional judgment. Additional testing of SVI is recommended in areas characterized by soils of different permeability and under different climates."

The set of dimensionless variables of the transformed mathematical model greatly facilitates the analysis and calculation of the velocity, temperature and concentration fields, and heat and mass transfer of the film condensation from the vapor每gas mixture. Meanwhile, three difficult points of analysis related to the reliable analysis and calculation of heat and mass transfer for the film condensation from the vapor每gas mixture were overcome. They include: (i) correct determination of the interfacial vapor condensate saturated temperature; (ii) reliable treatment of the concentration-dependent densities of vapor每gas mixture, and (iii) rigorously satisfying the whole set of physical matching conditions at the liquid每vapor interface. Furthermore, the critical bulk vapor mass fraction for condensation was proposed, and evaluated for the film condensation from the water vapor每air mixture, and the useful methods in treatment of temperature-dependent physical properties of liquids and gases were applied. With these elements in place, the reliable results on analysis and calculation of heat and mass transfer of the film condensation from the vapor每gas mixture were achieved.The laminar free film condensation of water vapor in the presence of air was taken as an example for the numerical calculation. It was confirmed that the presence of the non-condensable gas is a decisive factor in decreasing the heat and mass transfer of the film condensation. It was demonstrated that an increase of the bulk gas mass fraction has the following impacts: an expedited decline in the interfacial vapor condensate saturation temperature; an expedited decrease in the condensate liquid film thickness, the condensate liquid velocity, and the condensate heat and mass transfer. It was found that an increase of the wall temperature will increase the negative effect of the non-condensable gas on heat and mass transfer of the film condensation from the vapor每gas mixture."

Tests have been performed with biocatalyst beads made from alginate and carrageenan covering a range of bead diameter, gel concentration, concentration of biocatalyst and other additives, and solute molecular weight. At low gel concentration with entrapped biocatalyst, a solute of low molecular weight has a diffusion coefficient approaching that measured in water. However, with increased gel concentration, and especially with high loadings of microorganisms and other additives, the diffusion coefficients are significantly decreased. An empirical relationship was developed for the diffusion coefficient as a function of microbial loading."
Task-based Teaching Approaches of Chinese as a Foreign Language in Second Life through Teachers＊ Perspectives,"Tsun-Ju Lin, Szu-Yun Wang, Scott Grant, Ching-Ling Chien, Yu-Ju Lan, ","Procedia Technology, Volume 13, 2014, Pages 16-22, ","The purpose of this paper is to describe the integration of two task-based language teaching (TBLT) approaches in the 3D multi- user virtual environment (MUVE) Second Life and to discuss the benefits and challenges from the perspectives of an expert user in Australia and three novice users in Taiwan. A qualitative research methodology was conducted as the research design in the study. Participants included the four instructors from two countries and 144 Chinese language undergraduate students at a major Australian university. Three activity units based on information gap and reasoning gap teaching tasks were created. It was found that conducing TBLT in Second Life can help instructors provide opportunities for the students to set clear goals, ensure student- centred and authentic approaches to learning, and provide multiple opportunities for input, production, and feedback. Furthermore, the lesson configuration (with the expert taking care of technical issues in the physical classroom and the content instructors focusing on teaching virtually) helped reduce common technical issues in Second Life and thus promote a comfortable learning environment for both the instructors and students to solely focus on the learning content of the language class."
Developments for the non-destructive evaluation of highway bridges in the USA,"Glenn A. Washer, ","NDT & E International, Volume 31, Issue 4, August 1998, Pages 245-249, ","The collapse of the Silver Bridge in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, in 1967 initiated the formal requirements for the inspection of highway bridges in the USA. Almost 30 years later, visual inspection remains the primary method of bridge inspection. However, many new and promising techniques for the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of highway bridges have emerged in recent years through the NDE research program of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). These include infrared and radar imaging systems, portable ultrasonic systems, telemetry systems, laser deflection measurement systems, and many others. This paper discusses the recent development of these instruments, and the potential impact it may have on bridge inspection and bridge management systems. The paper also discusses the need for validation of system performance, and the FHWA plans to construct a national center for NDE validation at the Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center."

Altering Substrate Specificity and Detecting Processivity in Nucleases,"Stephen B. delCardayr谷, James E. Thompson, Ronald T. Raines, ","Techniques in Protein Chemistry, Volume 5, 1994, Pages 313-320, ","This chapter describes the alteration of substrate specificity and detection of processivity in nucleases. In a study described in the chapter, the cDNA for RNase A was carried in the bacterial expression plasmid pET22B such that its transcription was under the control of theT7RNApolymerasepromoter. Targeting of mature RNase A to the periplasm was directed by the pelB leader peptide. Echerichia coli (E.coli) cells harboring this plasmid have been induced to express up to 50 mg/L of recoverable, native RNase A. Zymogram electrophoresis of supernatant from E. coli cells induced to express the pBXRl library demonstrated the presence of an enzyme able to cleave polyA efficiently. Zymogram spot assay of individual transformants from this library identified those dones responsible for this new activity. Analysis of the enzyme, and DNA from these transformants indicated that the most active mutant had a glycine residue at position 45. Analysis of whole cell extract producing T45G RNase A confirmed that this mutation had increased dramatically the ability of RNase A to cleave polyA."
A model system to mimic environmentally active surface film roughness and hydrophobicity,"Jacob S. Grant, Scott K. Shaw, ","Chemosphere, Volume 185, October 2017, Pages 772-779, ","This work presents the development and initial assessment of a laboratory platform to allow quantitative studies on model urban films. The platform consists of stearic acid and eicosane mixtures that are solution deposited from hexanes onto smooth, solid substrates. We show that this model has distinctive capabilities to better mimic a naturally occurring film's morphology and hydrophobicity, two important parameters that have not previously been incorporated into model film systems. The physical and chemical properties of the model films are assessed using a variety of analytical instruments. The film thickness and roughness are probed via atomic force microscopy while the film composition, wettability, and water uptake are analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, contact angle goniometry, and quartz crystal microbalance, respectively. Simulated environmental maturation is achieved by exposing the film to regulated amounts of UV/ozone. Ultimately, oxidation of the film is monitored by the analytical techniques mentioned above and proceeds as expected to produce a utile model film system. Including variable roughness and tunable surface coverage results in several key advantages over prior model systems, and will more accurately represent native urban film behavior.Download high-res image (200KB)Download full-size image"
Improved Methodology to Measure Normal Incident Solar Radiation with a Multi-pyranometer Array,"Juan-Carlos Baltazar, Yifu Sun, Jeff Haberl, ","Energy Procedia, Volume 57, 2014, Pages 1211-1219, ","An improved methodology to estimate the normal incident solar radiation based on an anisotropic clear sky model using a Multi-Pyranometer Array (MPA) is analyzed in this paper. The MPA is a static platform, which is used to measure solar energy irradiation at different tilt and azimuth angles, and that can be used to estimate the normal incident component without the tracking devices that require more detailed installation and maintenance. The array's sensors are of the photovoltaic type, which require both the spectral and incidence angle corrections. These corrections were made by empirical functions; the one for the incidence angle is generic and the spectral effect is satisfied by calibrating each of the sensors with a Precision Spectral Pyranometer (PSP) with a four parameter change- point linear function. For this study, the calibrated data was verified by calculating their corresponding theoretical value based on the beam component from solar tracking Normal Incidence Pyrheliometer (NIP) and the diffuse component from a Black and White Pyranometer (B&W), which were located on the same test bench.The improved procedure is based on grouping the measurements of two sensors and analytically look for a satisfactory solution; one for the horizontal and south sensors and one for the east and west sensors. The solution for the east and west sensors is expanded to two new solutions by mirroring their readings according to the solar noon; each real measurement and its mirrored values generate a solution. The solutions are grouped to have a more steady and robust expression. A final switching scheme provides the value that was compared with the reference NIP measurement. The analysis of the results showed that the root square mean error (RMSE) of the sample decreased by a 30% in comparison with previous results reported in the literature. The data sample used in this study correspond to clear sky conditions on the fall and winter seasons, so further comparison on other seasons and with regular solar conditions is required."
Characterizing MPI matching via trace-based simulation,"Kurt B. Ferreira, Scott Levy, Kevin Pedretti, Ryan E. Grant, ","Parallel Computing, Volume 77, September 2018, Pages 57-83, ","With the increased scale expected on future leadership-class systems, detailed information about the resource usage and performance of MPI message matching provides important insights into how to maintain application performance on next-generation systems. However, obtaining MPI message matching performance data is often not possible without significant effort. A common approach is to instrument an MPI implementation to collect relevant statistics. While this approach can provide important data, collecting matching data at runtime perturbs the application＊s execution, including its matching performance, and is highly dependent on the MPI library＊s matchlist implementation. In this paper, we introduce a trace-based simulation approach to obtain detailed MPI message matching performance data for MPI applications without perturbing their execution. Using a number of key parallel workloads and microbenchmarks, we demonstrate that this simulator approach can rapidly and accurately characterize matching behavior. Specifically, we use our simulator to collect several important statistics about the operation of the MPI posted and unexpected queues. For example, we present data about search lengths and the duration that messages spend in the queues waiting to be matched. Data gathered using this simulation-based approach have significant potential to aid hardware designers in determining resource allocation for MPI matching functions and provide application and middleware developers with insight into the scalability issues associated with MPI message matching."
Intergenerational change in children's independent mobility and active transport in New Zealand children and parents,"Julie Bhosale, Scott Duncan, Grant Schofield, ","Journal of Transport & Health, Volume 7, Part B, December 2017, Pages 247-255, ","Previous research has indicated a decline in children's independent mobility; however, comparisons between directly-related generations are scarce. This study sought to determine the direct generational change in children's independent mobility and active transport in a large sample of New Zealanders.544 children (mean age 12.2 ㊣ 0.6 years) and 500 parents (43.9 ㊣ 5.8 years) participated in the study. Independent mobility (IM) was measured with IM Licences (parental permission to travel unsupervised) and IM Index (summed score from a questionnaire of destinations independently travelled). Questions on active transport, organsied activities, bicycle and vehicle ownership were also included. Parents recalled their behaviour retrospectively as 10每12-year-olds.Generalised linear modelling indicated that the proportion of parents who actively transported to and from school was significantly higher than in children (91.8% vs. 49.3% to school; 93.2% vs. 56.9% from school). The IM Index dropped generationally for both males (2.05 to 1.53) and females (1.77 to 1.40). Significant differences in IM Licences were also observed: parents being allowed to travel to school (OR 2.18 95% CI: 1.31, 3.63), cross main roads (OR 2.26 95% CI: 1.34, 3.71.), cycle main roads (OR 4.99 95% CI: 3.62, 6.87), and be out after dark (OR 3.05 95% CI: 2.12, 4.38) compared to children today. Bike ownership increased generationally with adults having an average of 2.5 bikes (95% CI: 2.37, 2.64) and children having 3.3 (95% CI: 3.05, 3.54). The average number of organised activities for adults was 1.8 (95% CI: 1.62, 1.89), which increased in children to an average number of 4.1 activities (95% CI: 3.89, 4.25).These findings demonstrate a clear generational decline in children's independent mobility and active transport. Greater promotion of active modes of travel and unstructured roaming in the neighbourhood may be an important step in reversing the reduction in this fundamental behaviour."

We report the outcomes of six older adults at high risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity who received dexrazoxane during induction/re-induction therapy. Five had preserved left-ventricular function while two proceeded onto stem-cell transplantation. Additional investigation of dexrazoxane in adult leukemia therapy is warranted, particularly in older patients at highest risk for cardiovascular mortality."

VGAT and VGLUT2 expression in MCH and orexin neurons in double transgenic reporter mice,"Carlos Blanco-Centurion, Emmaline Bendell, Bingyu Zou, Ying Sun, Meng Liu, ","IBRO Reports, Volume 4, June 2018, Pages 44-49, ","The neuropeptides orexin and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), as well as the neurotransmitters GABA (污-Aminobutyric acid) and glutamate are chief modulators of the sleep-wake states in the posterior hypothalamus. To investigate co-expression of vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT, a marker of GABA neurons) and the vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGLUT2, a marker of glutamate neurons) in orexin and MCH neurons, we generated two transgenic mouse lines. One line selectively expressed the reporter gene EYFP in VGAT+ neurons, whereas the other line expressed reporter gene tdTomato in VGLUT2+ neurons. Co-localization between these genetic reporters and orexin or MCH immunofluorescent tags was determined using 3D computer reconstructions of Z stacks that were acquired using a multiphoton laser confocal microscope. Our results demonstrated that MCH neurons expressed neither VGAT nor VGLUT2, suggesting MCH neurons are a separate cluster of cells from VGAT+ GABAergic neurons and VGLUT2+ glutamatergic neurons. Moreover, most orexin neurons expressed VGLUT2, indicating these neurons are glutamatergic. Our data suggested that in the posterior hypothalamus there are four major distinct groups of neurons: VGAT+, orexin+/VGLUT2+, orexin-/VGLUT2+, and MCH neurons. This study facilitated our understanding of the role of these neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in relation to sleep/wake regulation."
High pseudotumor cerebri incidence in tretinoin and arsenic treated acute promyelocytic leukemia and the role of topiramate after acetazolamide failure,"Morgan B. Smith, Elizabeth A.

Some less common toxicities of the combination may have yet to be fully realized. Of ten patients we have treated thus far, five (50%) have developed pseudotumor cerebri. In one patient, temporary discontinuation of ATRA and initiation of acetazolamide controlled symptoms. In four patients, topiramate was substituted for acetazolamide to relieve symptoms and allow ATRA dose re-escalation. We conclude that providers should monitor for pseudotumor cerebri and consider topiramate if acetazolamide fails."
Artificial lights improve the catchability of snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) traps,"Khanh Q. Nguyen, Paul D. Winger, Corey Morris, Scott M. Grant, ","Aquaculture and Fisheries, Volume 2, Issue 3, May 2017, Pages 124-133, ","This study investigated the behaviour and commercial catchability of snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) in response to different low-powered LED lights under laboratory and field conditions. We created a novel choice-experiment in a laboratory setting in which we investigated the behaviour of snow crab in response to coloured LED lights. The results showed that snow crab movement was dependent on light colour, with animals choosing to move toward blue and white lights, away from purple lights, and no detectable effect for green and red lights. We then conducted two field experiments to investigate the effect of the same LED lights on the catch rates of commercial traps during the 2016 snow crab fishery on the east coast of Newfoundland and Labrador. Results from the first field experiment showed that adding white and purple LED lights into baited traps significantly improved Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) by 77% and 47% respectively. Results from the second field experiment showed that unbaited traps equipped with only LED lights (no bait), could also catch snow crab in comparable amounts to traditional baited traps, with soak time and depth explaining some of the variation in CPUE. Taken together, these experiments suggest that fishing enterprises can improve their catching performance and profitability by adding LED lights to their traps, or by using LED lights as a bait replacement."

Interesting consequences of violation of the Pomeranchuk theorem are examined for a particular model, and pion nucleon differential cross sections are predicted in the Coulomb interference region.

Using heuristics to estimate an appropriate number of latent topics in source code analysis,"Scott Grant, James R. Cordy, David B. Skillicorn, ","Science of Computer Programming, Volume 78, Issue 9, 1 September 2013, Pages 1663-1678, ","Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a data clustering algorithm that performs especially well for text documents. In natural-language applications it automatically finds groups of related words (called ※latent topics§) and clusters the documents into sets that are about the same ※topic§. LDA has also been applied to source code, where the documents are natural source code units such as methods or classes, and the words are the keywords, operators, and programmer-defined names in the code. The problem of determining a topic count that most appropriately describes a set of source code documents is an open problem. We address this empirically by constructing clusterings with different numbers of topics for a large number of software systems, and then use a pair of measures based on source code locality and topic model similarity to assess how well the topic structure identifies related source code units. Results suggest that the topic count required can be closely approximated using the number of software code fragments in the system. We extend these results to recommend appropriate topic counts for arbitrary software systems based on an analysis of a set of open source systems."

Nanoparticles as synthetic vaccines,"Josiah D Smith, Logan D Morton, Bret D Ulery, ","Current Opinion in Biotechnology, Volume 34, August 2015, Pages 217-224, ","As vaccines have transitioned from the use of whole pathogens to only the required antigenic epitopes, unwanted side effects have been decreased, but corresponding immune responses have been greatly diminished. To enhance immunogenicity, a variety of controlled release vehicles have been proposed as synthetic vaccines, but nanoparticles have emerged as particularly impressive systems due to many exciting publications. In specific, nanoparticles have been shown capable of not only desirable vaccine release, but can also be targeted to immune cells of interest, loaded with immunostimulatory substances termed adjuvants, or even induce desirable immune activating effects on their own. In the present review, recent advances in the utilization of inorganic, polymeric, and biomolecular nanoparticles as synthetic vaccines are discussed."
Covariance consistency methods for fault-tolerant distributed data fusion,"Jeffrey K. Uhlmann, ","Information Fusion, Volume 4, Issue 3, September 2003, Pages 201-215, ","This paper presents a general, rigorous, and fault-tolerant framework for maintaining consistent mean and covariance estimates in an arbitrary, dynamic, distributed network of information processing nodes. In particular, a solution is provided that addresses the information deconfliction problem that arises when estimates from two or more different nodes are determined to be inconsistent with each other, e.g., when two high precision (small covariance) estimates place the position of a particular object at very different locations. The challenge is to be able to resolve such inconsistencies without having to access and exploit global information to determine which of the estimates is spurious. The solution proposed in this paper is called Covariance Union."

Using covariance intersection for SLAM,"Simon J. Julier, Jeffrey K. Uhlmann, ","Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Volume 55, Issue 1, 31 January 2007, Pages 3-20, ","One of the greatest obstacles to the use of Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) in a real-world environment is the need to maintain the full correlation structure between the vehicle and all of the landmark estimates. This structure is computationally expensive to maintain and is not robust to linearization errors. In this tutorial we describe SLAM algorithms that attempt to circumvent these difficulties through the use of Covariance Intersection (CI). CI is the optimal algorithm for fusing estimates when the correlations among them are unknown. A feature of CI relative to techniques which exploit full correlation information is that it provides provable consistency with much less computational overhead. In practice, however, a tradeoff typically needs to be made between estimation accuracy and computational cost. We describe a number of techniques that span the range of tradeoffs from maximum computational efficiency with straight CI to maximum estimation efficiency with the maintenance of all correlation information. We present a set of examples illustrating benefits of CI-based SLAM."

Andrographolide induces apoptosis via down-regulation of glyoxalase 1 and HMG-CoA reductase in HL-60 cells,"Chun-Chia Chen, Mei-Li Wu, Robert J. Doerksen, Chi-Tang Ho, Tzou-Chi Huang, ","Journal of Functional Foods, Volume 14, April 2015, Pages 226-235, ","Andrographolide (Andro) is the major active component of the traditional herbal bitter tea Andrographis paniculata. We tested the hypothesis that Andro exerted its antitumor activities through its effects on three key survival enzymes, glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), leading to cancer cell apoptosis. In human leukemia HL-60 cells Andro could reduce cholesterol levels, accompanied with down-regulation of Ras translocation to the membrane and downstream phosphorylation of Akt and ERK. Based on results obtained using specific inhibitors, LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor), and JSH-23 (NF-百B activation inhibitor), we proposed that the apoptotic effects of Andro in HL-60 cells arose because of interactions with the Ras/Akt/NF-百B/GLO1 and Ras/Raf/ERK/NF-百B/GLO1 pathways. Andro has a potential to be used as a functional food ingredient to prevent and manage inflammatory diseases including cancers."

Cellular specimens have been stained with antisera raised against total herpes type 2 virus (HSV-2) and subfractions labeled crude AG-e, pure AG-e, ICP 12, and ICP 14. Reproducibility, statistical significance, false positive and false negative results, specificity, and sensitivity of the various antisera have been investigated. Correlation of immunocytostaining with Papanicolaou staining has been made.Usefulness of these markers in the detection and diagnosis of premalignant and malignant cervical epithelial changes for mass screening has been discussed.Using crude AG-e, pure AG-e, HSV-2, and HSV-1 antisera in a number of blind studies, no significant differences were found in the reproducibility of results. Observations indicated that a minimum of 30 cells must be analyzed to make data amenable to statistical analysis.Exfoliated cells from 62, 75, 77, and 94% of patients respectively diagnosed as mild, moderate, and marked atypia, and cancer were studied with antisera against total HSV-2. Similar results were observed with antisera against pure AG-e.No patient reacted with anti-AG-e or anti-HSV-1 antiserum in the absence of reactivity to antisera against total HSV-2 antigens. Studies using anti-ICP 12 and -ICP 14 antigens established the wide and specific staining character of anti-HSV-2 antisera.Morphologic preservation of cells by Papanicolaou staining after the FA procedures was considered satisfactory for diagnostic purposes. Our studies indicated the potential usefulness of anti-HSV-2 and anti-AG-e antisera in mass cervical cancer screening programs and cytology automation."
Error scaling in fault tolerant quantum computation,"Marco Lanzagorta, Jeffrey Uhlmann, ","Applied Mathematics and Computation, Volume 219, Issue 1, 15 September 2012, Pages 24-30, ","The threshold theorem states that quantum computations can scale robustly in the presence of certain types of noise processes (e.g., Markovian) as long as the probability of error for each physical component remains below a critical threshold. To satisfy this threshold a theoretical circuit requiring O(s) idealized noiseless gates can be implemented with O(s polylog s) gates to maintain an error rate that is constant with increasing s. In this paper, we argue that maintaining a fixed error rate is necessary but not sufficient to preserve complexity results obtained under an assumption of noiseless gates. Specifically, we show that nontrivial quantum algorithms exhibit nonlinear sensitivity to any circuit error and that this sensitivity affects algorithmic complexity. The joint effects of circuit error and quantum-algorithmic iteration are examined for the case of quantum search, and more complete complexity results are derived."
The design of an anonymous file sharing system based on group anonymity,"Shivkumar Krishnan, Jeffrey Uhlmann, ","Information and Software Technology, Volume 46, Issue 4, 15 March 2004, Pages 273-278, ","There are a variety of contexts in which network users have legitimate reasons to want to exchange information, e.g. documents and media files, while maintaining anonymity. One such context is an online user group with a special interest in a particular medical condition that is associated with unfair or illegal discrimination. The challenge for designing a secure and anonymous file sharing system is that it seems necessary for some external source to know the network destination of the requested information. This is problematic because the identity of the recipient can potentially be determined from a network address. Even if the source or conduit of the information is trusted, it may be compromised by an outside agent who cannot be trusted. In this paper we use a general mechanism called ＆group anonymity＊ that provides a new level of network privacy and security. We also describe a particular use of this mechanism in a software system which is an anonymous file sharing application that preserves the anonymity of users using the system and the privacy of the data being exchanged."
Outcomes of Preoperative Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor Therapy in Patients Undergoing Isolated Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting,"Salman J. Bandeali, Waleed T. Kayani, Vei-Vei Lee, Wei Pan, Salim S. Virani, ","The American Journal of Cardiology, Volume 110, Issue 7, 1 October 2012, Pages 919-923, ","The association between preoperative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remain controversial. Our aim was to study in-hospital outcomes after isolated CABG in patients on preoperative ACE inhibitors. A retrospective analysis of 8,889 patients who underwent isolated CABG from 2000 through 2011 was conducted. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of major adverse events (MAEs) defined as a composite of mortality, postoperative renal dysfunction, myocardial infarction, stroke, and atrial fibrillation during index hospitalization. The secondary outcome was the incidence of individual outcomes included in MAEs. Logistic regression analyses were performed. Of 8,889 patients, 3,983 (45%) were on preoperative ACE inhibitors and 4,906 (55%) were not. Overall incidence of MAEs was 38.1% (n = 1,518) in the ACE inhibitor group compared to 33.6% (n = 1,649) in the no-ACE inhibitor group. Preoperative use of ACE inhibitors was independently associated with MAEs (odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.24), most of which was driven by a statistically significant increase in postoperative renal dysfunction (odds ratio 1.18, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.36) and atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.27). In-hospital mortality, postoperative myocardial infarction, and stroke were not significantly associated with preoperative ACE inhibitor use. Analyses performed after excluding patients with low ejection fractions yielded similar results. In conclusion, preoperative ACE inhibitor use was associated with an increased risk of MAEs after CABG, in particular postoperative renal dysfunction and atrial fibrillation."

Swan, ","Life Sciences, Volume 20, Issue 10, 15 May 1977, Pages 1723-1728, ","A method of rapidly analyzing hydroxybenzo (a) pyrene in single human lymphocytes with simultaneous sorting is reported. Cells with various levels of hydroxybenzo (a) pyrene were characterized and sorted by means of a Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter into three groups with low, intermediate and high amounts of benzo (a) pyrene metabolite. The mean amount per cell was calculated after measuring the fluorescence of the cell suspensions in a fluorometer. Hydroxybenzo (a) pyrene may be detected and quantitated in individual cells at a level of sensitivity less than 106 molecules per cell. The sorting capability allows for retrieval of precisely selected samples of cells for further studies of similar or other parameters."
Matrix permanent inequalities for approximating joint assignment matrices in tracking systems,"Jeffrey K. Uhlmann, ","Journal of the Franklin Institute, Volume 341, Issue 7, November 2004, Pages 569-593, ","This paper examines some of the combinatorial issues associated with the batch data association problem arising in tracking and correlation applications. A procedure is developed that addresses a large class of data association problems involving the calculation of permanents of submatrices of the original association matrix. This procedure yields what is termed the Joint Assignment Matrix (JAM), which can be used to optimally rank associations for hypothesis selection. Because the computational cost of the permanent scales exponentially with the size of the matrix, improved algorithms are developed both for calculating the exact JAM and for generating approximations to it. Empirical results suggest that at least one of the approximations is suitable for real-time hypothesis generation in large scale tracking and correlation applications. Novel theoretical results include an improved upper bound on the calculation of the JAM and new upper bound inequalities for the permanent of general nonnegative matrices. One of these inequalities is an improvement over the best previously known inequality."

Primary outcome was the development of any postoperative infection (composite of deep-sternal wound infection, leg harvest-site infection, pneumonia, or sepsis) after CABG. Secondary outcome was the association between pre-operative statin use and individual incidence of each aforementioned infection. Logistic regression analyses were performed.Incidence of any postoperative infection in patients who received statins pre-operatively was 6.5% compared to 8.3% in patients who did not receive statins. Pre-operative statin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the primary outcome (odds ratio (OR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60每0.90) in adjusted models. Among individual secondary outcomes, pre-operative statin therapy was associated with a reduced incidence of sternal wound infections (2.5% vs. 3.2%, OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5每0.8) and leg harvest site infections (0.6% vs. 1.3%, OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.2每0.8). Pre-operative statin therapy was not associated with a reduced incidence of pneumonia or sepsis.Pre-operative statin use is associated with a decrease in overall incidence of post-operative infections after CABG. We propose immunomodulatory effects of statins leading to a dampening of inflammatory cascade as the cause of our findings."

Synthetic strigolactone analogues reveal anti-cancer activities on hepatocellular carcinoma cells,"Mohammed Nihal Hasan, Hani Choudhry, Syed Shoeb Razvi, Said Salama Moselhy, Tadao Asami, ","Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Volume 28, Issue 6, 1 April 2018, Pages 1077-1083, ","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The complex etiology is attributed to many factors like heredity, cirrhosis, hepatitis infections or the dysregulation of the different molecular pathways. Nevertheless, the current treatment regimens have either severe side effects or tumors gradually acquire resistance upon prolonged use. Thus, developing a new selective treatment for HCC is the need of the hour. Many anticancer agents derived from plants have been evaluated for their cytotoxicity towards many human cancer cell lines. Strigolactones (SLs)-a newly discovered class of phytohormones, play a crucial role in the development of plant-root and shoot. Recently, many synthetic analogues of SLs have demonstrated pro-apoptotic effects on different cancer cell lines like prostate, breast, colon and lung. In this study, we tested synthetic SLs analogues on HCC cell line-HepG2 and evaluated their capability to induce cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. Primary WST-1 assays, followed by annexin-V/7AAD staining, demonstrated the anti-proliferative effects. The SLs analogues TIT3 and TIT7 were found to significantly reduce HepG2 cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner and induce apoptosis. Interestingly, though TIT3 and TIT7 strongly affected cancer cell proliferation, both compounds showed moderate anti-proliferative effect on normal cells. Further, migration of cancer cells was suppressed upon treatment with TIT3 and TIT7 in a wound healing assay. In summary, these findings suggest that two SLs analogues TIT3 and TIT7 exert selective inhibitory effects on cancer cells most likely through targeting microtubules. SLs analogues could be used in future as potential anti-cancer candidates in chemotherapy.Download high-res image (39KB)Download full-size image"
Management of asymptomatic cervical spinal stenosis in the setting of symptomatic tandem lumbar stenosis: A review,"George M. Ghobrial, Mark E. Oppenlander, Christopher M. Maulucci, Matthew Viereck, James S. Harrop, ","Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery, Volume 124, September 2014, Pages 114-118, ","This article reviews the literature regarding tandem asymptomatic cervical stenosis in the setting of symptomatic lumbar stenosis. The presenting features of cervical spondylotic myelopathy are insidious and consistent with upper motor neuron loss. Often, asymptomatic cervical stenosis is encountered in the clinical setting during the workup of a symptomatic lumbar stenosis and degenerative disease.A PubMed (1966 to July 2013) electronic database search was conducted for articles pertaining to the diagnosis of incidentally discovered cervical cord compression. Keywords and MESH terms were limited to asymptomatic cervical stenosis, asymptomatic cervical compression, asymptomatic spinal stenosis, asymptomatic cervical spondylosis, and asymptomatic cervical cord signal. The primary literature topics for manuscript inclusion were the development of symptomatic myelopathy from asymptomatic cord signal edema, as well as the presence of tandem stenosis as defined above by incidental cervical stenosis during the workup of lumbar degenerative disease.There were no previous systematic reviews, randomized trials, or prospective studies on the management of tandem cervical and thoracic stenosis. Five studies, all retrospective reviews containing relevant data were included in the review. Asymptomatic cervical stenosis encountered in the investigation of lumbar symptoms was had a 23% incidence. A risk of 5% per year of development of myelopathy previously reported.There is insufficient evidence in the literature to support the need for preemptive decompression for asymptomatic cervical cord compression with or without a correlative T2 hyperintense cord signal. Early diagnosis of radiculopathy or myelopathy in patients with cervical stenosis (i.e., through conversion of asymptomatic to symptomatic state) is important as each patient with in this clinical setting should be followed closely, as the literature shows the tendency for a clinical progression to eventual cervical myelopathy."
Topic-based knowledge mining of online student reviews for strategic planning in universities,"Sharan Srinivas, Suchithra Rajendran, ","Computers & Industrial Engineering, In press, corrected proof, Available online 6 July 2018, ","Over the past few years, studies observe a continuous decline in university enrollment and retention rates resulting in millions of dollars in lost revenue. Past research shows that 95% of the students rely heavily on the positive word-of-mouth to select a college. Especially, with the advent of Web 2.0 tools, students are able to make informed decisions due to increased awareness through online reviews. Academic institutions can also leverage this information to understand and improve their students＊ perception. The objective of this paper is to identify the current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of a university by analyzing online student reviews using text analytics. Our proposed approach integrates four different techniques: topic modeling, sentiment analysis, root cause and SWOT analyses. First, we introduce an ensemble of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (E-LDA) topic models to automatically identify the key features (topics) that are predominantly discussed by students and categorize each review sentence into the most related topic. We then detect the opinion associated with each sentence (positive, negative and neutral) using sentiment analysis. Finally, a topic-based opinion summary (TOS) for a university is established to identify its strengths and weaknesses from the students＊ perspective, and the opportunities and threats are determined by analyzing the TOS of the competitors (or other similar institutions). A case study is used to illustrate the feasibility and application of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed method provides an efficient and economic performance summary of a university and its competitors, and could help its leaders in recruitment and retention efforts."
Meta-Analysis of Comparison of 5-Year Outcomes of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Patients With Unprotected Left Main Coronary Artery in the Era of Drug-eluting Stents,"Mahin R. Khan, Waleed T. Kayani, Waqas Ahmad, Ravi S. Hira, Mahboob Alam, ","The American Journal of Cardiology, Volume 120, Issue 9, 1 November 2017, Pages 1514-1520, ","Patients with unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) disease are increasingly being treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using drug-eluting stents (DES), but long-term outcomes comparing PCI with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remain limited. We performed aggregate data meta-analyses of clinical outcomes (all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, repeat revascularization, cardiac death, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events) in studies comparing 5-year outcomes of PCI with DES versus CABG in patients with ULMCA disease. A comprehensive literature search (January 1, 2003 to December 10, 2016) identified 9 studies (6,637 patients). Effect size for individual clinical outcomes was estimated using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random effects model. At 5 years, PCI with DES was associated with equivalent cardiac (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.46) and all-cause mortality (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.33), lower rates of stroke (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.84), and higher rates of repeat revascularization (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.63 to 3.91); compared with CABG, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events showed a trend favoring CABG but did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.54). In conclusion, for ULMCA disease, PCI can be considered as a comparably effective and yet less invasive alternative to CABG given the comparable long-term mortality and lower incidences of stroke."

Optimizing outpatient appointment system using machine learning algorithms and scheduling rules: A prescriptive analytics framework,"Sharan Srinivas, A. Ravi Ravindran, ","Expert Systems with Applications, Volume 102, 15 July 2018, Pages 245-261, ","In the US, the demand for outpatient services is expected to increase, while the supply of physicians to provide the care is projected to decrease. Besides, inefficiencies in the appointment system (AS) and patient no-shows (patients who do not arrive for scheduled appointments) reduce provider productivity, timely access to care, and cost the U.S. healthcare system more than $150 billion a year. To handle increasing demand and compensate for patient no-shows, outpatient clinics tend to overbook appointments. The current scheduling practice at most clinics and majority of the scheduling rules proposed in the literature assume all patients are equally likely to miss an appointment. Further, most scheduling rules in the literature do not make use of the available data, such as electronic health records, when scheduling patients. This paper proposes a prescriptive analytics framework to improve the performance of an AS with respect to patient satisfaction (measured using average patient waiting time and number of patients unable to get an appointment for the day under consideration) and resource utilization (measured using average resource idle time, overflow time and overtime). In the proposed framework, patient-related data from various sources are used to develop predictive models that identify the risk of a patient no-show. Different scheduling rules, that leverage the patient-specific no-show risk is then proposed. A case study, with real data from a Family Medicine Clinic in Pennsylvania, is used to show the feasibility of the proposed framework. The effectiveness of the proposed scheduling rules is evaluated by benchmarking it with three rules adapted from the literature. The results indicate that the proposed scheduling rules consistently outperform the benchmark rules for all the clinic settings tested. Further, the proposed framework is generic and can be adopted by any outpatient clinic characterized by occurrences of no-shows and appointment-based customer arrivals."

This study evaluates the rate, etiology, complication and outcome of community- and hospital-acquired sepsis in a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia.This is a retrospective evaluation of all admissions with severe sepsis and septic shock to a general intensive care unit over a period of six months.A total number of 96 patients were included, which represented 15% of the total number of admissions during the study period. The mean age was 57.4 (SD 21). Sixty percent of cases were due to hospital-acquired infections, and 40% were community-acquired. The majority of the infections acquired in the hospital occurred in medical wards and intensive care units (27% and 21%, respectively). At least one co-morbid condition was present in 94% of the sample patients, with cardiovascular disease and diabetes being the most frequently encountered disorders (58%). Both community and hospital-acquired severe sepsis and septic shock carry very high mortality (58%). The ICU length of stay was significantly longer for hospital and ICU acquired infections.Both community and hospital-acquired infections carry high mortality. Hospital-acquired severe sepsis is frequent in medical wards and ICUs, and measures to further evaluate risk factors are prudent."

Self-tuning predictive control of processing temperature for food extrusion,"Jinglu Tan, James M. Hofer, ","Journal of Process Control, Volume 5, Issue 3, June 1995, Pages 183-189, ",A self-tuning regulator was developed for temperature control in a food extrusion process. Process models with on-line identification were used to predict the processing temperature and major disturbances. The regulator was designed in an explicit formulation based on feedforward and internal-model-based predictive control strategies.

The control system was implemented and tested experimentally. The effectiveness of the algorithms was demonstrated.

Computerized mouse pupil size measurement for pupillary light reflex analysis,"Wei Lu, Jinglu Tan, Keqing Zhang, Bo Lei, ","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, Volume 90, Issue 3, June 2008, Pages 202-209, ","Accurate measurement of pupil size is essential for pupillary light reflex (PLR) analysis in clinical diagnosis and vision research. Low pupil每iris contrast, corneal reflection, artifacts and noises in infrared eye imaging pose challenges for automated pupil detection and measurement. This paper describes a computerized method for pupil detection or identification. After segmentation by a region-growing algorithm, pupils are detected by an iterative randomized Hough transform (IRHT) with an elliptical model. The IRHT iteratively suppresses the effects of extraneous structures and noise, yielding reliable measurements. Experimental results with 72 images showed a mean absolute difference of 3.84% between computerized and manual measurements. The inter-run variation for the computerized method (1.24%) was much smaller than the inter-observer variation for the manual method (7.45%), suggesting a higher level of consistency of the former. The computerized method could facilitate PLR analysis and other non-invasive functional tests that require pupil size measurements."
Object density-based image segmentation and its applications in biomedical image analysis,"Jinhua Yu, Jinglu Tan, ","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, Volume 96, Issue 3, December 2009, Pages 193-204, ","In many applications of medical image analysis, the density of an object is the most important feature for isolating an area of interest (image segmentation). In this research, an object density-based image segmentation methodology is developed, which incorporates intensity-based, edge-based and texture-based segmentation techniques. The proposed method consists of three main stages: preprocessing, object segmentation and final segmentation. Image enhancement, noise reduction and layer-of-interest extraction are several subtasks of preprocessing. Object segmentation utilizes a marker-controlled watershed technique to identify each object of interest (OI) from the background. A marker estimation method is proposed to minimize over-segmentation resulting from the watershed algorithm. Object segmentation provides an accurate density estimation of OI which is used to guide the subsequent segmentation steps. The final stage converts the distribution of OI into textural energy by using fractal dimension analysis. An energy-driven active contour procedure is designed to delineate the area with desired object density. Experimental results show that the proposed method is 98% accurate in segmenting synthetic images. Segmentation of microscopic images and ultrasound images shows the potential utility of the proposed method in different applications of medical image processing."
Modeling blast wave propagation using artificial neural network methods,"Ian Flood, Bryan T Bewick, Robert J Dinan, Hani A Salim, ","Advanced Engineering Informatics, Volume 23, Issue 4, October 2009, Pages 418-423, ","The paper reports on work concerned with the development of artificial neural network approaches to modeling the propagation of bomb blast waves in a built-up environment. A review of current methods of modeling blast wave propagation identifies a need for a modeling system that is both fast and versatile in its scope of application. This is followed by a description of a preliminary study that used artificial neural networks to estimate peak pressures on buildings protected by simple blast barriers, using data generated from, first, an existing empirical model and, second, miniature bomb-barrier-building experiments. The first of these studies demonstrates the viability of the approach in terms of producing accurate results very rapidly. However, the study using data from live miniature bomb-barrier-building experiments was inconclusive due to a poor distribution of the sample data. The paper then describes on-going research refining this artificial neural network approach to allow the modeling of the time-wise progress of the blast wave over the surfaces of critical structures, facilitating a three-dimensional visualization of the problem. Finally, the paper outlines a proposed novel method of modeling blast wave propagation that uses a coarse-grain simulation approach combined with artificial neural networks, which has the goal of extending modeling to complicated geometries while maintaining rapid processing."
Flexural-torsional buckling of pultruded fiber reinforced plastic composite I-beams: experimental and analytical evaluations,"Julio F. Davalos, Pizhong Qiao, Hani A. Salim, ","Composite Structures, Volume 38, Issues 1每4, May每August 1997, Pages 241-250, ","In this paper a comprehensive experimental and analytical approach is presented to study flexural-torsional buckling behavior of full-size pultruded fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) I-beams. Two full-size FRP I-beams with distinct material architectures are tested under midspan-concentrated loads to evaluate their flexural-torsional buckling responses. To monitor rotations of the cross-section and the onset of critical buckling loads, transverse bars are attached to the beam crosssection and are subsequently connected to LVDTs; strain gages bonded at the edges of the top flange are also used. The analysis is based on energy principles, and the total potential energy equations for the instability of FRP I-beams are derived using nonlinear elastic theory. The equilibrium equation in terms of the total potential energy is solved by the Rayleigh-Ritz method, and simplified engineering equations for predicting the critical flexural-torsional buckling loads are formulated. A good agreement is obtained between the experimental results, proposed analytical solutions and finite-element analyses. Through the combined experimental and analytical evaluations reported in this study, it is shown that the testing setup used can be efficiently implemented in the characterization of flexural-torsional buckling of FRP shapes and the proposed analytical design equations can be adopted to predict flexural-torsional buckling loads."

Detection of incomplete ellipse in images with strong noise by iterative randomized Hough transform (IRHT),"Wei Lu, Jinglu Tan, ","Pattern Recognition, Volume 41, Issue 4, April 2008, Pages 1268-1279, ","An iterative randomized Hough transform (IRHT) is developed for detection of incomplete ellipses in images with strong noise. The IRHT iteratively applies the randomized Hough transform (RHT) to a region of interest in the image space. The region of interest is determined from the latest estimation of ellipse parameters. The IRHT ※zooms in§ on the target curve by iterative parameter adjustments and reciprocating use of the image and parameter spaces. During the iteration process, noise pixels are gradually excluded from the region of interest, and the estimation becomes progressively close to the target. The IRHT retains the advantages of RHT of high parameter resolution, computational simplicity and small storage while overcoming the noise susceptibility of RHT. Indivisible, multiple instances of ellipse can be sequentially detected. The IRHT was first tested for ellipse detection with synthesized images. It was then applied to fetal head detection in medical ultrasound images. The results demonstrate that the IRHT is a robust and efficient ellipse detection method for real-world applications."

DCMU [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea], a commonly used herbicide, was used as a test chemical and its diffusion into plant leaves and binding to plastoquinone B (QB) sites were analyzed by using the model. The dependency of delayed fluorescence (DF) emission on unbound QB sites was first derived theoretically and then observed experimentally. This yields a biophotonic method to measure the concentrations of DCMU and other herbicides that function by a similar mechanism. Experiments were performed to validate the developed method."
Wavelet analysis of pulse-amplitude-modulated chlorophyll fluorescence for differentiation of plant samples,"Ya Guo, Yesen Zhou, Jinglu Tan, ","Journal of Theoretical Biology, Volume 370, 7 April 2015, Pages 116-120, ","Pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) from photosystem II (PSII) of plants has been routinely measured for the analysis of photosynthesis and environmental changes. PAM ChlF from PSII is non-stationary and has time-varying frequency characteristics; however, existing analysis of PAM ChlF has been limited to selected characteristic values in the time domain. Wavelet transform is recognized as an efficient tool for analyzing non-stationary signals. In this research, an attempt was made to analyze PAM ChlF through wavelet transform. Features of PAM ChlF signals were computed from wavelet decomposition to classify two tree species and to detect chilling and detachment stresses. The wavelet-based features were compared with the commonly-used maximal PSII efficiency Fv/Fm. Both the wavelet-based features and Fv/Fm could effectively classify two tree species, but the former showed superiority than the latter in detecting the stresses. Wavelet transform revealed chilling stress earlier than Fv/Fm and detected detachment stress Fv/Fm failed to show. The results show that wavelet transform is a useful technique for analysis of PAM ChlF."
Identifiability and identification of switched linear biological models,"Ya Guo, Jinglu Tan, ","Biosystems, Volume 118, April 2014, Pages 31-38, ","Pulse is often used to excite biological systems. The inputs such as irrigation, therapy, and treatments to biological systems are also equivalent to pulses. This makes the biological system behave as switched models under the function of the input. To reduce difficulty in model parameter estimation, the system could be represented as a switched linear model under the pulse excitation. In this research, we studied the identification of a class of switched linear biological models with single input and the system matrix dependent on the intensity of excitation. System identifiability and identification were discussed. A recurrent-pulse excitation method was devised to provide necessary constraints for parameter estimation. The recurrent-pulse technique allowed determination of model parameters that would otherwise be difficult to determine uniquely. The usefulness of the method was demonstrated by examples including delayed fluorescence from photosystem II, which was well known as a versatile tool for sensing plant physiological status and environmental changes in the literature."

Fourier transform of delayed fluorescence as an indicator of herbicide concentration,"Ya Guo, Jinglu Tan, ","Journal of Theoretical Biology, Volume 363, 21 December 2014, Pages 271-276, ","It is well known that delayed fluorescence (DF) from Photosystem II (PSII) of plant leaves can be potentially used to sense herbicide pollution and evaluate the effect of herbicides on plant leaves. The research of using DF as a measure of herbicides in the literature was mainly conducted in time domain and qualitative correlation was often obtained. Fourier transform is often used to analyze signals. Viewing DF signal in frequency domain through Fourier transform may allow separation of signal components and provide a quantitative method for sensing herbicides. However, there is a lack of an attempt to use Fourier transform of DF as an indicator of herbicide. In this work, the relationship between the Fourier transform of DF and herbicide concentration was theoretically modelled and analyzed, which immediately yielded a quantitative method to measure herbicide concentration in frequency domain.

A biophotonic sensing method for plant drought stress,"Ya Guo, Jinglu Tan, ","Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, Volume 188, November 2013, Pages 519-524, ","Physiologically-based drought stress evaluation is very desirable for sustainable plant production, but effective measures and technologies are lacking. Drought stress limits photons utilized for photosynthetic reactions and delayed fluorescence (DF) generated by photosystem II (PSII). In this research, DF is measured as an output variable of the PSII phototransduction system and its dependence on photon utilization rate as affected by water status is modeled and analyzed. This yields an effective way to define and measure plant water status or deficiency (drought stress) according to PSII photon utilization rate. Water deficiency is determined by the deficit from the maximum photon utilization rate achievable through rehydration. The method was validated experimentally with drought-stressed plant samples. Analysis and experiments show that this drought-dependent deficit in photon utilization rate can be effectively evaluated from measured DF emissions and it varies with drought severity."
Ultrasound speckle reduction by a SUSAN-controlled anisotropic diffusion method,"Jinhua Yu, Jinglu Tan, Yuanyuan Wang, ","Pattern Recognition, Volume 43, Issue 9, September 2010, Pages 3083-3092, ","An ultrasound speckle reduction method is proposed in this paper. The filter, which enhances the power of anisotropic diffusion with the Smallest Univalue Segment Assimilating Nucleus (SUSAN) edge detector, is referred to as the SUSAN-controlled anisotropic diffusion (SUSAN_AD). The SUSAN edge detector finds image features by using local information from a pseudo-global perspective. Thanks to the noise insensitivity and structure preservation properties of SUSAN, a better control can be provided to the subsequent diffusion process. To enhance the adaptability of the SUSAN_AD, the parameters of the SUSAN edge detector are calculated based on the statistics of a fully formed speckle (FFS) region. Different FFS estimation schemes are proposed for envelope-detected speckle images and log-compressed ultrasonic images. Adaptive diffusion threshold estimation and automatic diffusion termination criterion are employed to enhance the robustness of the method. Both synthetic and real ultrasound images are used to evaluate the proposed method. The performance of the SUSAN_AD is compared with four other existing speckle reduction methods. It is shown that the proposed method is superior to other methods in both noise reduction and detail preservation."

Venous blood samples were taken after CPR and 1 and 2 hours after restoration of spontaneous circulation to measure serum interleukin-8 levels by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The median serum interleukin-8 levels after CPR were significantly higher in resuscitated than in nonresuscitated patients (64.9 pg/ml; range 30.2 to 1497 vs 0 pg/ml; range 0 to 31.6 pg/ml; p < 0.001). One and 2 hours after restoration of spontaneous circulation, the median serum interleukin-8 levels were 96.2 pg/ml and 155.4 pg/ml, respectively. Mean values of systolic blood pressure immediately after and 1 and 2 hours after restoration of spontaneous circulation were 117 ㊣ 9 mm Hg, 130 ㊣ 11 mm Hg, and 136 ㊣ 13 mm Hg, respectively. No significant correlations were found between hemodynamic values and serum interleukin-8 levels.

"Cardiac troponin T, creatine kinase, and its isoform release after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with or without stenting","Kou-Gi Shyu, Pei-Liang Kuan, Jun-Jack Cheng, Chi-Ren Hung, ","American Heart Journal, Volume 135, Issue 5, May 1998, Pages 862-867, ","Background Cardiac troponin T is a sensitive and specific marker for the detection of minor myocardial injury. However, it has been rarely used to monitor myocardial injury after coronary stenting. The purpose of the study was to measure troponin T after apparently successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without coronary stenting and to compare its result with serum creatine kinase and its isoform, CKMB. Methods The incidence of cardiac troponin T elevation was compared with that of creatine kinase or CKMB in 120 consecutive patients with symptomatic ischemia undergoing visually successful PTCA with (n = 59) or without stenting (n = 61). Troponin T, creatine kinase, and CKMB were measured before, immediately after, and 18 to 24 hours after the procedures were performed. Results No patient had abnormal troponin T, creatine kinase, or CKMB levels before and immediately after the procedures. Moreover, no patient showed electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction. Troponin T was elevated in 17 patients at 18 to 24 hours after coronary stenting and in eight patients after PTCA. Both creatine kinase and CKMB were elevated in five patients after coronary stenting and in three patients after PTCA. The frequency of abnormal troponin T levels was significantly higher than that of creatine kinase or CKMB after coronary interventions (21% vs 6.7%; p < 0.01), and it was significantly higher after stenting when compared with angioplasty alone (29% vs 13%; p < 0.05). Patients with abnormal troponin T levels were more likely to undergo repeat revascularization than those without (24% vs 6%; p < 0.01). Conclusion Cardiac troponin T is more sensitive than creatine kinase and CKMB in detecting minor myocardial injury after coronary interventions. The incidence of troponin T release is higher in the patients undergoing stent implantation than in patients treated with angioplasty alone. (Am Heart J 1998;135:862-7.)"

Yung, ","Genomics, Volume 104, Issue 6, Part B, December 2014, Pages 504-511, ","EGFR signaling pathway and microRNAs (miRNAs) are two important factors for development and treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Microarray analysis enables the genome-wide expression profiling. However, the information from microarray data may not be fully deciphered through the existing approaches. In this study we present an mRNA:miRNA stepwise regression model supported by miRNA target prediction databases. This model is applied to explore the roles of miRNAs in the EGFR signaling pathway. The results show that miR-145 is positively associated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the pre-surgery NSCLC group and miR-199a-5p is positively associated with EGF in the post-surgery NSCLC group. Surprisingly, miR-495 is positively associated with protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2) in both groups. The coefficient of determination (R2) and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) demonstrate good performance of our regression model, indicating that it can identify the miRNA roles as oncomirs and tumor suppressor mirs in NSCLC."

One such domain is medical radiology for which the clinically useful information in an image typically consists of gray level variations in highly localized regions of the image. Currently, it is not possible to extract these regions by automatic image segmentation techniques. To address this problem, we have implemented a human-in-the-loop (a physician-in-the-loop, more specifically) approach in which the human delineates the pathology bearing regions (PBR) and a set of anatomical landmarks in the image when the image is entered into the database. To the regions thus marked, our approach applies low-level computer vision and image processing algorithms to extract attributes related to the variations in gray scale, texture, shape, etc. In addition, the system records attributes that capture relational information such as the position of a PBR with respect to certain anatomical landmarks. An overall multidimensional index is assigned to each image based on these attribute values."
Heritable genotype contrast mining reveals novel gene associations specific to autism subgroups,"Matt Spencer, Nicole Takahashi, Sounak Chakraborty, Judith Miles, Chi-Ren Shyu, ","Journal of Biomedical Informatics, Volume 77, January 2018, Pages 50-61, ","Though the genetic etiology of autism is complex, our understanding can be improved by identifying genes and gene-gene interactions that contribute to the development of specific autism subtypes. Identifying such gene groupings will allow individuals to be diagnosed and treated according to their precise characteristics. To this end, we developed a method to associate gene combinations with groups with shared autism traits, targeting genetic elements that distinguish patient populations with opposing phenotypes. Our computational method prioritizes genetic variants for genome-wide association, then utilizes Frequent Pattern Mining to highlight potential interactions between variants. We introduce a novel genotype assessment metric, the Unique Inherited Combination support, which accounts for inheritance patterns observed in the nuclear family while estimating the impact of genetic variation on phenotype manifestation at the individual level. High-contrast variant combinations are tested for significant subgroup associations. We apply this method by contrasting autism subgroups defined by severe or mild manifestations of a phenotype. Significant associations connected 286 genes to the subgroups, including 193 novel autism candidates. 71 pairs of genes have joint associations with subgroups, presenting opportunities to investigate interacting functions. This study analyzed 12 autism subgroups, but our informatics method can explore other meaningful divisions of autism patients, and can further be applied to reveal precise genetic associations within other phenotypically heterogeneous disorders, such as Alzheimer＊s disease.Download high-res image (174KB)Download full-size image"
Using Human Perceptual Categories for Content-Based Retrieval from a Medical Image Database,"Chi-Ren Shyu, Christina Pavlopoulou, Avinash C. Kak, Carla E. Brodley, Lynn S. Broderick, ","Computer Vision and Image Understanding, Volume 88, Issue 3, December 2002, Pages 119-151, ","It is often difficult to come up with a well-principled approach to the selection of low-level features for characterizing images for content-based retrieval. This is particularly true for medical imagery, where gross characterizations on the basis of color and other global properties do not work. An alternative for medical imagery consists of the ※scattershot§ approach that first extracts a large number of features from an image and then reduces the dimensionality of the feature space by applying a feature selection algorithm such as the Sequential Forward Selection method.This contribution presents a better alternative to initial feature extraction for medical imagery. The proposed new approach consists of (i) eliciting from the domain experts (physicians, in our case) the perceptual categories they use to recognize diseases in images; (ii) applying a suite of operators to the images to detect the presence or the absence of these perceptual categories; (iii) ascertaining the discriminatory power of the perceptual categories through statistical testing; and, finally, (iv) devising a retrieval algorithm using the perceptual categories. In this paper we will present our proposed approach for the domain of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images of the lung. Our empirical evaluation shows that feature extraction based on physicians' perceptual categories achieves significantly higher retrieval precision than the traditional scattershot approach. Moreover, the use of perceptually based features gives the system the ability to provide an explanation for its retrieval decisions, thereby instilling more confidence in its users."

Clinical and histologic parameters were followed for a period from 6 months to 10 years. Complete clinical clearing of lesions was observed in 51 patients (62%) and most of them were in limited-plaque MF group or parapsoriasis en plaque. The mean total dose of PUVA for complete clearing was less for early MF. Thirty-one patients (38%) relapsed and responded to additional PUVA. Patients in early stages of the disease remained clear for up to 68 months after the first course of PUVA. Post-treatment skin biopsies with early MF showed histologic clearing.A new combination therapy for MF is presented in 15 patients. Recombinant interferon alpha-2a (Roferon-A), administered intramuscularly combined with PUVA were tested in a phase I trial. Interferon doses were from 6每30 million units three times weekly. Disease stages ranged from I-B to IV-B. Complete responses were obtained in 12 of 15 patients, and partial responses seen in 2 of 15 patients, for an overall response rate of 93%. The median duration of response exceeded 23 months (range, 3 to 25 months). All responding patients have been maintained on therapy. The dose-limiting toxicities were constitutional symptoms such as fevers and malaise (93.3%), leukopenias (40.0%), mental status changes consisting of depression and confusion (33.3%), and photosensitivity (26.6%). Interferon plus PUVA appear to be highly effective regimens for the treatment of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas."

Fast GPU Algorithm for Analyzing Effective Connectivity in Functional Brain Imaging,"Lawrence Chan, Bin Pang, Chi-Ren Shyu, Tao Chan, Pek-Lan Khong, ","IFAC Proceedings Volumes, Volume 46, Issue 20, 2013, Pages 349-352, ","Functional imaging, such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), allows the in-vivo study of the human neuronal circuitry. By applying specific environmental stimuli to human subjects, functional imaging detects signals that could indicate direct or indirect neuronal connectivity when they exhibit certain levels of association between brain regions. However, the directed connections cannot be identified using simple statistical approaches, such as pair-wise correlations. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is more appropriate for analyzing the causal relationship, called the effective connectivity. SEM is aimed to fit a path model subject to the anatomical constraints using the data collected from imaging study. Such data-driven path analysis involves the minimization of a maximum likelihood (ML) discrepancy function with respect to some constrained path coefficients. The minimization process is iterative. In each of iterations, a constrained coefficient will be switched to unconstrained and added to the pool of the unconstrained for the minimization. The iterations continue until the model attains an acceptable level of parsimonious fit index. The computing time is a big issue because it increases geometrically with the number of unconstrained path coefficients, in other words, the number of iterations. Using Quad-Core Central Processing Unit (CPU), it takes a month for the iterations from 0 to 30 path coefficients. High speed computing hardware and software can be applied to the optimization process so as to cope with the above-mentioned issue. Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) is a kind of high speed hardware solution that performs ultra-fast algorithmic computation on huge data matrices. This study demonstrates the utilization of GPU with the parallel Genetic Algorithm (GA) replacing the Powell minimization in the standard analysis software package. It is shown in an example of 30 path coefficients that the time taken for the path analysis can be reduced from 30 days to 3.6 hours. The breakthrough of this study in high speed computing greatly relaxes the limitation on the number of paths to be investigated in functional imaging and maintains the performance of optimization."
Ablation of human choriocarcinoma xenografts in nude mice by antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) with three novel compounds,"Caroline J. Springer, Kenneth D. Bagshawe, Surinder K. Sharma, Frances Searle, Roger G. Melton, ","European Journal of Cancer and Clinical Oncology, Volume 27, Issue 11, November 1991, Pages 1361-1366, ","Three novel prodrugs have been designed for use as anticancer agents. Each is a bifunctional alkylating agent which has been protected to form a relatively inactive prodrug. They are designed to be activated to their corresponding alkylating agents at a tumour site by prior administration of an antitumour antibody conjugated to the bacterial enzyme carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2) in a two-phase system called antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT). The Km and Vmax values for three different antibody-CPG2 conjugates were determined in relation to each prodrug. The Km values ranged from 4.5每12 米mol/l and the Vmax from 0.5-1.6 米mol/U/min. Athymic Nu/Nu mice with palpable transplanted human choriocarcinoma xenografts, which are resistant to conventional chemotherapy, were treated with anti-human chorionic gonadotropin antibodies conjugated to CPG2. This was followed by each of the three novel prodrugs. Significant increase in survival was obtained in three of the regimens tested using only one course of treatment. This demonstrates the potential of a tumour-localised bacterial enzyme to activate protected alkylating agents in order to eradicate an established human xenograft."
"RIAM, an Ena/VASP and Profilin Ligand, Interacts with Rap1-GTP and Mediates Rap1-Induced Adhesion","Esther M. Lafuente, Andr谷 A. F. L. van Puijenbroek, Matthias Krause, Christopher V. Carman, Vassiliki A. Boussiotis, ","Developmental Cell, Volume 7, Issue 4, October 2004, Pages 585-595, ","The small GTPase Rap1 induces integrin-mediated adhesion and changes in the actin cytoskeleton. The mechanisms that mediate these effects of Rap1 are poorly understood. We have identified RIAM as a Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule. RIAM defines a family of adaptor molecules that contain a RA-like (Ras association) domain, a PH (pleckstrin homology) domain, and various proline-rich motifs. RIAM also interacts with Profilin and Ena/VASP proteins, molecules that regulate actin dynamics. Overexpression of RIAM induced cell spreading and lamellipodia formation, changes that require actin polymerization. In contrast, RIAM knockdown cells had reduced content of polymerized actin. RIAM overexpression also induced integrin activation and cell adhesion. RIAM knockdown displaced Rap1-GTP from the plasma membrane and abrogated Rap1-induced adhesion. Thus, RIAM links Rap1 to integrin activation and plays a role in regulating actin dynamics."
Rapid Diagnostec Test for Ocular Adenovirus,"Lee Wiley, David Springer, Regis P. Kowalski, Robert Arffa, Y. Jerold Gordon, ","Ophthalmology, Volume 95, Issue 4, April 1988, Pages 431-433, ","A new, direct, enzyme immunoassay test (Adenoclone, Cambridge BioScience, Hopkinton, MA) was evaluated for the rapid diagnosis of ocular adenovirus infections. In 36 culture-proven cases of adenovirus ocular infection, direct Adenoclone testing of conjunctival swabs was positive in 24 of 31 patients (77%) tested within 1 week of onset of symptoms, and in one of five patients (20%) who presented after 1 week (P < 0.02). Overall sensitivity was 69%, whereas specificity was 100%. The authors conclude that a positive Adenoclone test is reliable in the rapid diagnosis of early adenovirus ocular infections."
Simulations of femtosecond laser-induced desorption of CO from Cu(100),"Clayton Springer, Martin Head-Gordon, John C. Tully, ","Surface Science, Volume 320, Issues 1每2, 1994, Pages l57-l62, ","Trajectory calculations of laser-induced desorption of CO from Cu(100) were performed employing molecular dynamics with electronic frictions and fluctuating forces to account for nonadiabatic energy exchange between nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom. The simulations were performed with an initial surface temperature of 95 K in the low coverage limit, with rapid electronic heating and cooling modeled via the electronic fluctuating forces. The calculated desorption yields are in rough agreement with available experiments, supporting the underlying mechanism of direct nonadiabatic energy transfer from hot electrons to adsorbate motion. Preferential nonadiabatic energy flow into frustrated rotational modes of CO on Cu is identified as a significant contributor to desorption."

Cognitive Tools for Humanoid Robots in Space,"Donald Sofge, Dennis Perzanowski, Marjorie Skubic, Magdalena Bugajska, Alan Scbultz, ","IFAC Proceedings Volumes, Volume 37, Issue 6, June 2004, Pages 351-356, ","The effective use of humanoid robots in space will depend upon the efficacy of interaction between humans and robots. The key to achieving this interaction is to provide the robot with sufficient skills for natural communication with humans so that humans can interact with the robot almost as though it were another human. This requires that a number of basic capabilities be incorporated into the robot, including voice recognition, natural language, and cognitive tools on-board the robot to facilitate interaction between humans and robots through use of common representations and shared humanlike behaviors."
Simulations of the femtosecond laser-induced desorption of CO from Cu(100) at 0.5 ML coverage,"Clayton Springer, Martin Head-Gordon, ","Chemical Physics, Volume 205, Issues 1每2, 15 April 1996, Pages 73-89, ","Simulations of the femtosecond laser-induced desorption of CO from Cu(100) at an initial temperature of 95K are reported, employing molecular dynamics with electronic frictions. Results are obtained for saturation (0.5 ML) CO coverage, which are compared with additional simulations in the zero coverage limit. In both cases, the desorption yield depends nonlinearly on laser fluence, with initial nonadiabatic energy flow occurring selectively from hot substrate electrons to the molecule-surface frustrated rotation. There is significant enhancement of the desorption yield at saturation relative to the zero coverage limit. This is due to conversion of momentum in the plane of the surface to normal momentum, by collisions between an energetic adsorbate and its neighbors, and energy pooling between molecules in the overlayer."
Randomized Trial of Intelligent Sensor System for Early Illness Alerts in Senior Housing,"Marilyn Rantz, Lorraine J. Phillips, Colleen Galambos, Kari Lane, Chelsea B. Deroche, ","Journal of the American Medical Directors Association, Volume 18, Issue 10, October 2017, Pages 860-870, ","Measure the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of using sensor data from an environmentally embedded sensor system for early illness recognition. This sensor system has demonstrated in pilot studies to detect changes in function and in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness.Prospective intervention study in 13 assisted living (AL) communities of 171 residents randomly assigned to intervention (n=86) or comparison group (n=85) receiving usual care.Intervention participants lived with the sensor system an average of one year.Continuous data collected 24 hours/7 days a week from motion sensors to measure overall activity, an under mattress bed sensor to capture respiration, pulse, and restlessness as people sleep, and a gait sensor that continuously measures gait speed, stride length and time, and automatically assess for increasing fall risk as the person walks around the apartment. Continuously running computer algorithms are applied to the sensor data and send health alerts to staff when there are changes in sensor data patterns.The randomized comparison group functionally declined more rapidly than the intervention group. Walking speed and several measures from GaitRite, velocity, step length left and right, stride length left and right, and the fall risk measure of functional ambulation profile (FAP) all had clinically significant changes. The walking speed increase (worse) and velocity decline (worse) of 0.073 m/s for comparison group exceeded 0.05 m/s, a value considered to be a minimum clinically important difference. No differences were measured in health care costs.These findings demonstrate that sensor data with health alerts and fall alerts sent to AL nursing staff can be an effective strategy to detect and intervene in early signs of illness or functional decline."

Average in-home gait speed: Investigation of a new metric for mobility and fall risk assessment of elders,"Erik Stone, Marjorie Skubic, Marilyn Rantz, Carmen Abbott, Steve Miller, ","Gait & Posture, Volume 41, Issue 1, January 2015, Pages 57-62, ","A study was conducted to assess how a new metric, average in-home gait speed (AIGS), measured using a low-cost, continuous, environmentally mounted monitoring system, compares to a set of traditional physical performance instruments used for mobility and fall risk assessment of elderly adults. Sixteen participants were recruited from a local independent living facility. In addition to having their gait monitored continuously in their home for an average of eleven months, the participants completed a monthly clinical assessment consisting of a set of traditional assessment instruments: Habitual Gait Speed, Timed-Up and Go, Short Physical Performance Battery, Berg Balance Scale 每 short form, and Multidirectional Reach Test. A methodology is developed to assess which of these instruments may work well with the largest subset of older adults, is best suited for detecting changes in an individual over time, and most reliably captures the true mobility level of an individual. Using the ability of an instrument to predict how an individual would score on all the instruments as a metric, AIGS performs best, having better predictive ability than the traditional instruments. AIGS also displays the best agreement between observed and smoothed values, indicating it has the lowest intra-individual test每retest variability of the instruments. AIGS, measured continuously, during normal everyday activity, represents a significant shift in assessment methodology compared to infrequently assessed, traditional physical performance instruments. Continuous, in-home data may provide a more accurate and precise picture of the physical function of older adults, leading to improved mobility and fall risk assessment."

"Colour-generating mechanism of copper-red porcelain from Changsha Kiln (A.D. 7th每10th century), China","Yuanqiu Li, Yimin Yang, Jian Zhu, Xingguo Zhang, Gary Solbrekken, ","Ceramics International, Volume 42, Issue 7, 15 May 2016, Pages 8495-8500, ","Changsha Kiln, located at Changsha in Hunan Province, south of China, is famous for exported and coloured porcelain during the Tang Dynasty (A.D. 7th-10th century) period. Although the opinion that copper-red porcelain originates from Changsha Kiln is widely accepted in academic circles, chemical characters of glaze and colour mechanism of its copper-red porcelain have not been fully investigated and studied. Therefore, a shard of opaque glaze porcelain with red pigments which excavated at Changsha Kiln (A.D. 7th-10th century) was analyzed by Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF), Synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), micro X-ray diffraction (米-XRD), microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods. Combining with XANES and 米-XRD results, it indicates that metal copper is the major colouring-generation element status of the red hue. On the other hand, for the first time the study demonstrates that glaze of the sample from Changsha kiln is a typical phase separated-crystalline glaze with large particles surrounding acicular crystals which lead the opaque appearances. Because the sample from Changsha Kiln is Chinese ancient early stage copper-red porcelain relic, it will help to understand the origin of copper-red porcelain in China and enrich the knowledge of Chinese ancient ceramic culture."
